3
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:41,995
It's him.

4
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:51,759
Damn it.

5
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,727
<i>I couldn't get off a shot.</i>

6
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:58,015
Stand by.
We'll get him on the way out.

7
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,395
Manuel!

8
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:23,479
Hey, Manny!

9
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:01,620
- Put Mauricio on the phone.
- Victor?

10
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,338
Just put Mauricio on!

11
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:04,463
He's dead.

12
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:07,293
- What?
- Someone shot him in the head.

13
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:08,919
What is happening?

14
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:33,194
I see him.
He's leaving the building.

15
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:35,654
I'm set.

16
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,664
It's not him.

17
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:48,797
He can't be far.

18
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,151
Coming at you! Gray Sedan!

19
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:40,678
Target is out of range.

20
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
Move out.

21
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,362
- <i>911. What's your emergency?</i>
- Yes.

22
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:53,687
I want to report
a stolen vehicle.

23
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,078
License plate...

24
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:59,207
SNE15C5.

25
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:17,513
Sweetheart,
we already talked about this, remember?

26
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:19,258
You're supposed
to call me "Grandpa".

27
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,969
You don't look like a grandpa.

28
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,055
Couldn't agree with you more.

29
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:27,892
The cartoon I turned on is boring.

30
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,411
Okay. We'll find another one.

31
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,067
<i>This is the boldest
diplomatic initiative</i>

32
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,482
<i>we've seen in a generation.</i>

33
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:38,922
<i>It could finally lay
a foundation for real peace</i>

34
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,571
<i>throughout the entire region.</i>

35
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,365
<i>Bob, the president's
certainly betting her legacy</i>

36
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,153
<i>on the success
of the negotiations...</i>

37
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,850
Grandpa!
This isn't a cartoon!

38
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,585
This one! I like this one!

39
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,808
Sorry we're late. They're redirecting
everyone around the UN.

40
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,603
- It's all right. We're doing fine.
- How was the zoo?

41
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,814
To be honest with you, we spent our time
just going back and forth

42
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,649
between the black and polar bears.

43
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:20,152
I forgot to mention
that she's going through a bear phase.

44
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,831
She certainly knows what she wants.

45
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,982
She reminds me of you.

46
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,084
That's funny.

47
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:29,779
I always tell Stephen
how much she reminds me of you.

48
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:32,046
Anyway, we'll be there
in a few minutes.

49
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:34,291
Okay. Don't worry.
We'll meet you in the lobby.

50
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,133
Sounds like they had fun.

51
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,789
They always do.

52
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,617
What's wrong?

53
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:46,303
We talked to him about moving
to LA the night we got here.

54
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,305
He said he'd think about it.

55
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,183
And he hasn't mentioned one word
about it since. And we leave tonight.

56
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,143
Maybe he has to check
with his doctors.

57
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,696
No, they cleared him two weeks ago.
He's finished with treatment.

58
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,389
I don't know.

59
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,360
My father has been on his own
for so long.

60
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,570
Maybe he doesn't know
how to live any other way.

61
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,072
Why don't you ask him again?

62
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:09,104
My father is not the type of person
you ask twice.

63
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,968
If you want, I can do it.

64
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,355
Here at the United Nations,

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,006
a White House spokesman
just confirmed that Presidents

66
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,518
Taylor and Hassan will be holding
a joint press conference.

67
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,499
It is widely expected
that President Hassan will announce

68
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:31,015
the dismantling of his country's
nuclear weapons program.

69
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:35,060
President Hassan has stated
that he considers these negotiations

70
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:38,905
a historic success
and a new beginning for his country

71
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,816
and the entire Mideast region.

72
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,120
I believe that
that is a reasonable compromise.

73
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,990
Now, Mr. President, let's move on
to the issue of verification.

74
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:51,495
Now, the language
in your latest proposal is vague.

75
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,633
Let me be clear.

76
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:58,333
My country agrees to abandon
the pursuit of nuclear weapons

77
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,641
with full International
Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.

78
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,630
But our terms, Mr. President,

79
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:07,509
were that the inspectors themselves
would be American,

80
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,677
not IAEA.

81
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,553
With respect, Madam President,

82
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,098
your side pushed the point,
but we never conceded.

83
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,101
With respect,
your side has refused to negotiate

84
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,940
the point in good faith.

85
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,439
Without Americans...

86
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:23,359
Surely, we're not going to let
the nationality of a few hundred men...

87
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,026
... verification has no teeth.

88
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,696
Only the United States
can be trusted, Mr. Secretary?

89
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:30,262
This is the message that you sent

90
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,242
and you wonder
why we don't want to negotiate.

91
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,160
Farhad.

92
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,490
Madam President,

93
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,425
please excuse my brother's passion.

94
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,317
He only wants what is best
for our country.

95
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:41,592
I understand.

96
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:45,172
But we need to resolve this issue
before we can move forward.

97
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,169
And ideally,
before the press conference,

98
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,136
which gives us less than an hour.

99
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,765
What would your Congress say

100
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:57,726
if my Revolutionary Guard

101
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,770
was stationed on your soil?

102
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,215
It's the same
with my National Assembly.

103
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:08,487
Even if I agreed to this,
they would not ratify it.

104
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,573
After all, I'm not a king.

105
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:13,335
Nor I a queen.

106
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:16,036
Too bad for both of us.

107
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:20,207
I'd like to adjourn

108
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,765
and discuss this issue
with our respective teams.

109
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,890
Of course.

110
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:39,591
You are aware he was a salesman
before entering politics.

111
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:40,936
Household appliances.

112
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,565
You want to bet
he sold a lot of refrigerators?

113
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,824
Find a way to give him
what he wants.

114
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,348
You heard me.

115
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,783
Try to make the inspections work.

116
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,244
This man is a once
in a lifetime leader.

117
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:02,022
And he has already suspended his support
for terrorist organizations,

118
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,792
and privately, he's advocating

119
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,502
for a two-state solution.

120
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:08,255
How much further can we expect him
to stick his neck out?

121
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:26,669
Come here.

122
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,091
- Did you name him yet?
- Bear.

123
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,568
- "Bear."
- There she is.

124
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,950
I heard that you

125
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,495
and Grandpa were
hanging out with the bears.

126
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:43,624
Then we had ice cream,
but I didn't like mine, so Grandpa

127
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:44,893
gave me his.

128
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:47,044
- That's nice.
- Here, I got her.

129
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,882
- Thanks for watching her.
- Of course.

130
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,999
Listen, I've been thinking a lot
about what we talked about.

131
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,536
And I've made up my mind.

132
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,472
I want to move back to Los Angeles.

133
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,474
- Really?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,623
I got a friend
who's got a private security firm.

135
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:05,229
He'd give me some consulting work.
He's also got a place I can rent.

136
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:08,587
- Dad, I don't know what to say.
- Come here.

137
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:12,736
Say nothing.
Give me a ride to the airport tonight.

138
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,405
- Wait, you're coming with us tonight?
- If it's okay.

139
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,263
He's coming with us tonight.

140
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,882
I've got a few more things to pack.
I don't have very much.

141
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:22,955
- I can be at your hotel in an hour.
- Perfect.

142
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,917
We can get back and finish packing.

143
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,626
It'll be all right if I fly back
to Los Angeles with you?

144
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,756
- I'll walk you to the car.
- Let's go.

145
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:39,153
I got her.

146
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,151
We're going in the car.

147
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:50,824
Get your belt done up...

148
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,172
- I am so glad that you're doing this.
- Me, too.

149
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,097
- I love you.
- Love you.

150
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:01,660
I'll see you in an hour.

151
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,239
Bye, sweetheart.

152
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:38,001
Good afternoon, everyone.

153
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,129
All right, just a few things
before we get started here.

154
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:44,411
Presidents Taylor and Hassan
will each make a statement

155
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,825
after they've been introduced
by the Secretary-General.

156
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,101
The Q&A will follow,

157
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:50,375
but I want you to keep
your questions strictly on topic.

158
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,378
For obvious reasons, we're all operating
under heightened security measures,

159
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:56,866
so, unless you've been dying to know
what a chokehold feels like,

160
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:58,758
keep your credentials visible
at all times.

161
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:01,136
All right?
That's all for now.

162
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,610
Meredith Reed, press.

163
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,272
It's invalid.

164
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
What?

165
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:15,900
It can't be invalid.

166
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,235
Can you double check?

167
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,155
I did, ma'am.
Your credentials have been revoked.

168
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,492
- Revoked by whom?
- I don't have that information.

169
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,935
Okay, this has to be
some sort of mistake.

170
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,663
You do remember me.

171
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:29,246
Please step aside, ma'am.

172
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:43,095
I just talked
to Secretary of State Kanin.

173
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:46,264
He's agreed to IAEA inspectors.

174
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:49,976
- That's good news.
- There is a condition attached.

175
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:53,605
They're insisting that the head
of the verification team be an American.

176
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,110
I think we can live with that.

177
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,445
You know where I stand.

178
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:03,197
We've already surrendered too much
in the name of peace.

179
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,367
Surrender is a strong word, Farhad.

180
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,828
And what have we surrendered really,

181
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:10,495
apart from our nuclear ambition?

182
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:11,915
Isn't that enough?

183
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,502
Spinning 6,000 centrifuges
is good for political maneuvering,

184
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,921
but it's helping to bankrupt
our country.

185
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,409
The truth is,

186
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,758
we are not the ones
being so generous.

187
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:24,678
President Taylor is lifting
economic sanctions,

188
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,264
and offering an aid package
worth billions of dollars.

189
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:29,181
We got everything we wanted, Farhad.

190
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:31,351
As long as it's not a trick.

191
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:42,389
I'm sorry to bother you
with something so mundane,

192
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:45,322
but I'm stuck outside.

193
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:46,740
Stuck?

194
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,410
<i>My press credentials
have been revoked.</i>

195
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:52,414
- I don't know what happened.
- I'll take care of it.

196
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,665
Are you sure?

197
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,067
Of course.

198
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:56,594
Thank you.

199
00:13:57,331 --> 00:14:00,143
Will you still have time
for the interview later?

200
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,019
After the press conference.

201
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,710
I'm looking forward to it.

202
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:05,835
So am I.

203
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,936
Reinstate Miss Reed's clearance.

204
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,103
- I was only...
- Just do it.

205
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,691
People are starting to talk
about you and this reporter.

206
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:21,860
And saying what?

207
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,530
Miss Reed is a journalist,
she's profiling me for her newspaper.

208
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,574
- But you have feelings for her.
- I'm friendly with her.

209
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,952
Think whatever you like.

210
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,205
This woman poses no threat to me
or the peace process.

211
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,624
Not here maybe,

212
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:38,778
but back in our country
you'll be torn apart.

213
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,148
The mullahs will say
you have been corrupted by the West.

214
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:43,423
What do you say?

215
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:44,725
Have I?

216
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:46,885
Have I been corrupted by the West?

217
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,429
You know I don't believe that.

218
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,222
But you are married.

219
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:55,644
Dalia hasn't been a wife to me
for a long time.

220
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,105
- That's no excuse to be reckless.
- I've done nothing reckless.

221
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,979
I've done nothing reckless.

222
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,634
Just reinstate
Miss Reed's clearance now.

223
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:09,977
I'll see to it.

224
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:37,936
Victor.

225
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:40,973
What are you doing here?
How the hell did you find me?

226
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,275
I was always resourceful.
That's what you liked about me.

227
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:45,402
Get in here.

228
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:47,537
Take a seat.

229
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,739
- What happened?
- I need help.

230
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:52,852
- You need an ambulance.
- Don't call.

231
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:55,999
That's what he's waiting for.
He's listening to the channels.

232
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:56,871
Who?

233
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,707
Just listen to me.
I have information.

234
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:01,767
The best I can do for you
is get you an ambulance.

235
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,587
I don't work
for the government anymore.

236
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,577
This you're going to want to hear.

237
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:06,881
Why?

238
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,093
Why? Because you're the guy
who always does the right thing.

239
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:14,389
There's a big hit going down.

240
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,669
- On who?
- President Hassan at the UN.

241
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:18,396
He's getting taken out.

242
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,768
- When?
- Today.

243
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:22,378
Before he can sign this thing
with Taylor.

244
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:26,414
You see?
I told you you'd be interested.

245
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:27,801
How do you know this?

246
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:29,863
I'm the one that got
the hitter into the country.

247
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:32,908
- I've been setting him up.
- And then he tried to take you out.

248
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,359
You're the only one at CTU
I ever did business with.

249
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:40,323
I need you to call them, vouch for me,
so I can cut a deal.

250
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,186
- Come on.
- Keep your seat.

251
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,961
I swear, this is real.

252
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,503
Someone is trying to make sure

253
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,089
that this peace agreement
does not happen.

254
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:52,502
I'm not doing anything
until you give me your weapon.

255
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:00,018
- Better not be screwing with me.
- I'm not. I swear, I'm not.

256
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,478
Who's the hitter? His name?

257
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:03,897
- Who's the hitter?
- I don't know his name.

258
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,233
- He's Russian or something.
- Not good enough. Who is the hitter?

259
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,527
I know how to find him and stop him.

260
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,031
But I'm not saying another word
until I make my deal.

261
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:19,204
You're lucky I'm retired.

262
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:45,201
This is Cole Ortiz. Move Singer's team
to the northeast quadrant,

263
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:48,154
and tell him, from now on,
I want updates every quarter hour.

264
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,360
Get back to me with confirmations.

265
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,321
Hastings wants you to expand
the patrol perimeter around the UN.

266
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:56,989
Great, but I barely have enough men
to cover the perimeter now.

267
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:59,619
- I'll see if I can get NYPD.
- Dana...

268
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:06,668
My sister said she left you a couple of
messages for the bridesmaids' dresses.

269
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,111
I told her there was probably a problem
with your voicemail.

270
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,548
I got her messages.
I just haven't had a chance.

271
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,859
- These double shifts...
- I revised the protocols at the UN.

272
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,303
You might like to take a look at it.

273
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,959
- Yeah, I do.
- I'll call your sister back, I promise.

274
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:21,084
Thanks.

275
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,564
Damn it, what is the problem?

276
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:31,311
Percussive maintenance?

277
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:34,716
That's what my network apps professor
called it when I hit my computer.

278
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:37,365
- Can I help?
- I just got the revised attendee list

279
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,243
for the press conference. I can't get
the facial recognition done in time.

280
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:43,955
You're running each person through
individually. Do them in a batch.

281
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,082
Not if the data
is in different formats.

282
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,184
That used to be true, but here.

283
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,884
Like I said, there's no reason
to be shy about asking for help.

284
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:59,345
Don't worry.
You'll catch up. You're doing great.

285
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,274
Excuse me.

286
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:04,517
O'Brien.

287
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:06,449
Chloe, it's Jack.

288
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,688
Did you tell Kim about LA?

289
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,149
Yeah, but not now.
I need to speak to the director.

290
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:13,735
Mr. Hastings is on the phone,

291
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,987
and he really doesn't like
to be interrupted.

292
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,323
Tell him it's regarding a plot
againt President Hassan.

293
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:20,617
<i>See if that gets his attention.</i>

294
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,873
Okay, hold on.

295
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:33,232
Now, give me an overlay on the UN,
view from the west.

296
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,883
Now, overlay the distribution
of security teams, please.

297
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,139
That looks good.

298
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:43,952
Give me a comp with incident reports
and satellite imaging.

299
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,600
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

300
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,638
Gary, hold on for a second.

301
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,558
Jack Bauer's on line three.
He says he needs to talk to you.

302
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,734
It's about a plot against Hassan.
You might want to take it the call.

303
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,626
Gary, I'll call you back.

304
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,451
Mr. Bauer, this is Brian Hastings.

305
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,703
I'm with an informant
that I used to run

306
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,581
who's claiming he's got intel
on an assassination attempt on Hassan.

307
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:11,423
- It'll take place today.
- We've received several threats

308
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:14,129
- in regard to the peace conference.
- I can only imagine.

309
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:15,811
My informant is Victor Aruz.

310
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:18,383
I used him in the Salazar op.
You should be able to pull his file.

311
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:21,260
He's been shot in the arm...
he claims by the assassin.

312
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,680
Look, I don't think
you should take this lightly.

313
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,475
And what does Mr. Aruz want
in return for his information?

314
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,394
CTU protection and immunity.

315
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,148
- That's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer.
- Have you pulled his file yet?

316
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,238
I know him and my instinct is telling me
that you need to pay attention to this.

317
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,824
I need more than your instinct,
Mr. Bauer.

318
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,326
CTU isn't the organization you knew.

319
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:48,906
Okay, fine, but understand this:
If anything happens to President Hassan,

320
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,209
I'll call President Taylor and tell her
I tried to provide you with this intel,

321
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:54,962
<i>and you ignored it.</i>

322
00:20:56,677 --> 00:21:00,008
- What is taking so long for the file?
- Still searching through the archives.

323
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:02,343
Mr. Hastings,
I need your answer now.

324
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,302
<i>Are you bringing Aruz in or not?</i>

325
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:11,953
- Let me talk to him.
- I'll put you on speaker.

326
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:13,897
Go ahead.

327
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:16,607
<i>Mr. Aruz,
I'm gonna need some other details</i>

328
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,061
to corroborate your story.

329
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,904
The hitter took out two of my guys.
Manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez.

330
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,989
- <i>Check with the cops.</i>
- We will.

331
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:27,994
- <i>Mr. Bauer, where are you?</i>
- 1145 West 18th.

332
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:29,912
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.

333
00:21:30,037 --> 00:21:32,474
The closest helipad to you is...

334
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:35,293
the 12th precinct.
That's five blocks away.

335
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,373
Can you get him there, Mr. Bauer?

336
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:46,018
- I'll have a team there in 20 minutes.
- Don't use official channels.

337
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:48,544
We believe the assassin
is monitoring emergency bandwidth.

338
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:49,669
Got it.

339
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:53,493
Gather comm and tactical,
tell them we've got a situation.

340
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:55,285
Let's go.

341
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:06,768
There you are.

342
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,536
Now that doesn't suck.

343
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,454
Arlo.

344
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:15,563
Come on.
Hastings called an emergency briefing.

345
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,544
And if he ever catches you doing that,
you'll be out of a job.

346
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,294
Be worth it.
I think this might be love.

347
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:22,804
Now.

348
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:27,220
This is CTU transferring control
of drones A31 and 32

349
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,857
to HS aerial command.

350
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,273
Roger that.
Offload confirmed.

351
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,812
We've got a situation.
Cole, scramble a chopper for a pickup.

352
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,855
And the new patrol parameters?

353
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,358
- This is a priority.
- Who am I picking up?

354
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,620
Someone who claims to have intel
about a threat to President Hassan.

355
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,281
- How good is the intel?
- According to Jack Bauer, very.

356
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,033
- Jack Bauer?
- He's delivering the informant.

357
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:50,785
Who is Jack Bauer?

358
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:55,748
Location's downtown,
Chloe's sending you the coordinates.

359
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,710
Take a small team with you.
Torres' people are free.

360
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,920
I'll need a second team
to secure the landing.

361
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,340
One team will be enough. We'll use
a drone to protect the ground operation.

362
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,676
Arlo, scramble a drone
alongside the chopper.

363
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:10,763
Full spectrum coverage of the landing
zone as well as the air corridor.

364
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,187
Done.

365
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:40,583
We're clear. Come on.

366
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:49,552
Dispatch, this is Unit 2354.

367
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,296
<i>Go ahead, 2354.</i>

368
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,931
Got a plate match
on a stolen vehicle.

369
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,386
<i>... 03 Pontiac.</i>

370
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:02,279
<i>Plate: Sierra, November, Echo,</i>

371
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:04,478
<i>one, five, Charlie, five.</i>

372
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,310
<i>Got bullet holes
in the windshield and body.</i>

373
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:09,997
- That's him.
- <i>Roger that. What's your location?</i>

374
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,451
<i>Vehicle's parked on 18th,
just west of Ninth Avenue.</i>

375
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,517
We'll take care of it.

376
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:16,898
Will you?

377
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,374
Or am I going to have to step in?

378
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,628
Now would be the time to tell me.

379
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:25,463
Aruz is a dead man, sir.

380
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,923
You have my word.

381
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:28,891
Good.

382
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,630
Thank you.

383
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:57,454
Excuse me, Madam President.

384
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:03,448
President Hassan accepted
our counterproposals on inspections.

385
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,084
That is great news.

386
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:08,673
By the end of this next session,
we may have a signed agreement.

387
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:12,844
It's an extraordinary accomplishment,
Allison.

388
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,225
A problem?

389
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,397
I was thinking about Henry.

390
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:27,146
Achieving a comprehensive peace
agreement with the Islamic Republic

391
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:30,224
was something
that he and I talked about years ago.

392
00:25:31,744 --> 00:25:35,302
I wish that he were here
to share the moment.

393
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,012
You surprised?

394
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,584
Considering his behavior
during the divorce,

395
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:46,601
yes, I am surprised.

396
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,464
He went out of his way to hurt you,
especially in the press.

397
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:52,800
He was angry, Ethan.
I sent our daughter to prison.

398
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,802
You refused to cover up a murder.

399
00:25:55,716 --> 00:25:58,723
Olivia was responsible
for what happened... no one else.

400
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,743
Still,
if the the situation had been reversed,

401
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:04,020
I might've felt
the same way as Henry.

402
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,131
Sorry if I'm interrupting,
but I just talked to Hastings at CTU.

403
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:08,357
What's going on, Rob?

404
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:12,153
Someone's claiming to have information
about an assassination plot on Hassan.

405
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,572
- How real is the threat?
- Real enough to loop you in.

406
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,131
This informant came to them
through Jack Bauer.

407
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:19,994
I thought Jack was out of all of this.
How did he get involved?

408
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,038
This informant came to him.

409
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,208
We'll know more once he signs
a deal, provided you authorize it.

410
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,669
- How secure is the venue?
- Very. I just raised the alert level.

411
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,381
But we need to inform Hassan,
ideally before the conference.

412
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:33,758
We can't tell Hassan.

413
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:36,093
Certainly not before
the press conference.

414
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:39,264
- Why not?
- Well, he might scuttle everything,

415
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,058
- out of concern for his own safety.
- Hassan's a big boy.

416
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,868
He's used to taking risks
or he wouldn't be here, you know that.

417
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:47,746
Plus, if Hassan finds out
we knew about this and didn't tell him,

418
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:50,306
then all the trust we've built up
goes out the window,

419
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:51,901
and then he'll pull out of talks.

420
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,569
Frankly, I wouldn't blame him.

421
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:01,062
I'll think about it.

422
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:02,692
Thank you both.

423
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:11,152
Madam President, I'm telling you,

424
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:13,673
holding this back from Hassan
could be disastrous.

425
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:17,134
I said I'd think about it, Rob.
Thank you.

426
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:42,910
Listen... sorry if I went after you
a little hard in there.

427
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:44,829
I was just making my point.

428
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:46,914
No need to apologize, Rob.

429
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:51,045
I recommended you to the President
because you're not afraid to speak up.

430
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,680
She needs that.

431
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,915
Still,
I know I can get carried away.

432
00:27:57,913 --> 00:27:59,363
Don't worry, kid...

433
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:00,947
I ain't dead yet.

434
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,246
I can handle myself.

435
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,094
Even up against you.

436
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,444
Sweetheart, it's me.

437
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,363
We're almost done.
Are you on your way?

438
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,658
Something came up.
I'm gonna be a little late.

439
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:24,554
How late?

440
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:26,678
I should meet you at the airport.

441
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,626
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

442
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,543
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- Kim, I promise everything's fine.

443
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:35,671
Teri is so excited
you're coming back with us.

444
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:39,508
- Let me know when you're on your way.
- Okay, thanks, sweetheart.

445
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,700
Keep your eyes open.

446
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,654
The precinct's two blocks away.

447
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:47,121
Let's cut through here.
Come on.

448
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,872
The FAA's cleared a route
and informed all relevant agencies

449
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,518
that we will be in the air.

450
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:55,071
Good luck.

451
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,445
Aruz's file...
it was in a proprietary database.

452
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,916
- That's why it took so long.
- That shouldn't have thrown you.

453
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,054
- You've been here a month.
- Almost a month,

454
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,369
and I've had to relearn everything here.
Everything's changed.

455
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,746
And you're having trouble adapting,
I understand.

456
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,457
But I don't think
it's a question of your intelligence.

457
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:14,126
- Thanks.
- I think it's ambivalence.

458
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,503
Ambivalence?!

459
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:19,632
I know you only took this job
because your husband was downsized.

460
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:21,802
- Am I wrong?
- No!

461
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:23,552
I mean, yes.

462
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:27,056
Please, just give me a little more time
to get up to speed here.

463
00:29:28,624 --> 00:29:30,709
Mr. Hastings, I need this job.

464
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:33,688
Fair enough.

465
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:35,773
But I'm all about efficiency,

466
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,567
so if you don't improve,
you may want to rethink working here.

467
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:41,947
Now,
I trust this has been clarifying.

468
00:29:43,454 --> 00:29:44,454
Sure.

469
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,535
If you really wanted to be
more efficient, just say

470
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,911
that if I don't catch up soon,
I'll be fired.

471
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,644
Your flight path is a straight shot
southwest over the river,

472
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,282
and the 12th Precinct has confirmed

473
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:03,550
that their helipad is clear
and operational.

474
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:07,408
Full coverage of your flight, both legs,
and full-time aerial from the drone...

475
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,637
Why are you looking at me like that?

476
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,183
Like what?

477
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,841
I just want to make sure
nothing's wrong.

478
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,323
Nothing's wrong, like I said.

479
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:23,237
- Just be careful, okay?
- I will be.

480
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:24,974
You ready?

481
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,097
Maybe she should finally set a date.

482
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:33,622
She's getting cold feet.

483
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,917
How about you shut up
and just focus on your assignment?

484
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,399
Come on, Victor!
Look out!

485
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:08,574
Stay with me.
Victor, stay with me!

486
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:09,700
Stay with...

487
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Damn it.

488
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,231
Stay with me!

489
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:49,172
We're going to need
to recompress the wound.

490
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,022
<i>If successful, the agreement</i>

491
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:13,375
<i>could be the beginning
of a real lasting peace</i>

492
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,070
<i>in a long-troubled region.</i>

493
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:17,337
<i>Presidents Taylor and Hassan
are scheduled</i>

494
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:19,482
<i>to give their first joint
press conference</i>

495
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:22,410
<i>in just a few minutes,
and we'll carry that live.</i>

496
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:24,139
<i>In a moment, Christiane Doumany</i>

497
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:27,236
<i>will have a report on the history
of the many failed attempts</i>

498
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,591
<i>at a Mideast peace,</i>

499
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,656
<i>and why this accord
may be different.</i>

500
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:35,516
It's time to go.

501
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:37,246
Tell your father
I'll be right there.

502
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:39,790
I'll wait until you're done.

503
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,128
He doesn't trust me to be on time.

504
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:46,380
Of course he trusts you.

505
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:56,264
When did you become
such a good liar?

506
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,201
You don't have
to defend your father, Kayla.

507
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:07,062
He can take care of himself.

508
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:22,240
You look beautiful, Dalia.

509
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:23,959
And you look handsome.

510
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,257
Let's not pretend
any more than we have to.

511
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,633
I'm sorry you had to see that.

512
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:43,437
It's not your fault.

513
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,101
My dear Kayla.

514
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,614
We should go.

515
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:26,021
Let her through.

516
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:41,578
Thank you.

517
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,707
I will tell you
the same thing that I told him.

518
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,739
Unless you want to destroy
everything that he's worked for,

519
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:50,314
stay away from him.

520
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,035
Excuse me, ma'am.

521
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:07,513
President Hassan is on his way.

522
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,458
You won't tell him
he's being targeted.

523
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:14,987
I'm sorry.

524
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,156
You risk destroying
in a single day all the...{\
- Rob,}

525
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,825
You've made your point.
More than once.

526
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:23,537
I don't like keeping this
from President Hassan any more than you.

527
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,705
Then tell him.

528
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:31,920
Mr. President.

529
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,464
Ladies.

530
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,041
- You've met my chief of staff?
- Of course.

531
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,261
Hello.

532
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:41,383
I haven't had the chance
to thank you

533
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,766
for compromising
on the verification issue.

534
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,352
It was the right thing to do.

535
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,439
If you don't mind,
I'd like to brief you

536
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,274
on the format
of the press conference.

537
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,028
The Secretary-General will introduce
you both after some brief remarks.

538
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,865
The conference itself shouldn't take
any longer than 25 minutes or so.

539
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,620
Put your hand on it.

540
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:06,836
Let's go.

541
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,707
We're almost there.

542
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,125
Don't move!

543
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,196
Got a call that you're having
a problem down here.

544
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,944
- What's up?
- My name is Jack Bauer.

545
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:16,965
I'm transporting
this man on behalf of CTU.

546
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,468
He's an informant
vital to national security.

547
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,035
Call it in.

548
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:24,597
The men that are trying to kill him
are monitoring all emergency channels.

549
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:26,058
Don't let him make that call.

550
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,399
Shut up and get against
the Dumpster. Now!

551
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,647
At least take us into the precinct.
We can verify everything there.

552
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,020
Get down, now!

553
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,790
Damn it!

554
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,798
I cover you.
Make a run for the door.

555
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,366
You ready? Go! Go!

556
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,723
Keep moving.
I'm out of bullets.

557
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:11,411
Chloe, it's Jack.
How far out is the helicopter?

558
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:13,814
- Two minutes. Jack, what's wrong?
- <i>We're under attack.</i>

559
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,358
Put me in touch
with whoever's in command of that unit.

560
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,851
Okay. It's Agent Ortiz.
He's the head of field ops.

561
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,529
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

562
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:23,574
Mr. Hastings, we have a situation
with the pickup.

563
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,258
Keep going to the roof.
Now.

564
00:37:25,383 --> 00:37:27,547
Don't stop for anything.
Keep going.

565
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,498
- Agent Ortiz, you're on with Bauer.
- <i>Roger.</i>

566
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,916
What's going on?

567
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,196
We're being pursued by two shooters.
We can't make the precinct.

568
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,298
We're in a building on West 21st,
three doors in from Ninth Avenue.

569
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,258
We're heading to your position now.

570
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,302
<i>We're looking
for an alternate pickup.</i>

571
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,470
Copy that.

572
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,493
Right there.

573
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:56,481
The roof of that parking structure
might work.

574
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,484
- Can you zoom in closer?
- It'll take a minute.

575
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,445
I'm moving the drone there now.

576
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,615
There's a parking structure next to you.
Roof looks clear to land.

577
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,824
Did you get that?

578
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:07,784
Yeah, I see it.
Mr. Bauer,

579
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,288
looks like you can access that roof
from the eighth floor of the building.

580
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,594
- How far out are you?
- 90 seconds.

581
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,918
Copy that.
Don't be late.

582
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:22,007
Victor, listen to me.

583
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,007
Tell me everything you know
about the hitter,

584
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,335
so I can call it in
if we don't make it.

585
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,305
If I don't make it,
I don't care what happens.

586
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,731
Get me to CTU.

587
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:36,186
You always were a son of a bitch.
Come on.

588
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,958
Come on.
Let's go.

589
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,264
Stay there.

590
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:34,079
Lock down access points to the roof!

591
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,375
- Where are the hostiles?
- They're dead.

592
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,836
You need to get him out of here.
He's losing a lot of blood.

593
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,963
Cole Ortiz.
It's an honor to meet you.

594
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,133
Thanks for doing this.
Hastings wants to debrief you at CTU.

595
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,968
I'm not going back to CTU.
I'm done.

596
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,733
I got a flight to catch.

597
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,431
That's it?

598
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,684
Get down!

599
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,471
Ortiz, report in.

600
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,415
What's your status?

601
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,821
Jack, come in.

602
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:27,340
Jack, can you hear me?

603
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:29,738
Anyone, come in.

604
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,357
Come on.
Stay with me, stay with me.

605
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:45,776
Listen to me.
You don't want to die like this.

606
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:49,321
Do the right thing.
Tell me what you know.

607
00:40:51,787 --> 00:40:53,742
The hitter has someone
on the inside.

608
00:40:56,723 --> 00:40:58,023
Close to Hassan.

609
00:40:58,942 --> 00:41:00,207
Give me a name.

610
00:41:00,843 --> 00:41:02,778
Give me a name.
Give me a name!

611
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,430
Who's on the inside?

612
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,257
Come on.

613
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:10,926
Come on.

614
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:20,685
He's dead.

615
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:34,157
The brother revoked my clearance,
but I had Hassan reinstate it.

616
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,497
I know.
I know I'm behind schedule.

617
00:41:39,576 --> 00:41:41,026
But it'll get done.
