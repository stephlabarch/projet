4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,931
Hassan is unhappy about Taylor's
response to the ultimatum.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,476
If he wants to take it up with her,
he can do it when...

6
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,480
- Throw your gun down.
- What are you doing?

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,401
My life for tens of thousands?
I couldn't live with that.

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,402
What if they blow up
the bomb anyway?

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,945
I've tried to stop it.

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,366
We've got less than five minutes.

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,034
You can't trust him!

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,536
Don't move.
Hands where we can see them!

13
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,331
- Is he still alive?
- Yes, ma'am.

14
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,291
Where is Hassan?

15
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,086
I don't know.

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,046
Don't lie to me!

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,715
They have Hassan.
We have the bomb.

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,842
The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd.

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,805
President Hassan was handed over
ten minutes ago.

20
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,141
We have an ambush point yet?

21
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,643
Intersection of 161st and Amsterdam.

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,728
CTU is following you.

23
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,481
- Can you find me an exit?
- Between 158th

24
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>and 159th.</i>

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
<i>Parking garage.</i>

26
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,155
They've made us.
He's breaking left.

27
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,075
He's going back into the garage.

28
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,122
Coming straight at me!

29
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,213
You know where to go.

30
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,594
<i>You have Hassan?</i>

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,431
He transfered him
to another vehicle.

32
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,349
Someone inside CTU
is tipping them off.

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,644
A matter of time
before this gets traced back to me.

34
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,687
I need to get out of here
while I still can.

35
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:52,194
{\$THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE
BETWEEN 7:00AM AND 8:00AM}

36
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,538
Excuse me.

37
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,414
I need your passkey.

38
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,085
- What's this about?
- New protocol since the EMP.

39
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,296
Nobody gets in or out
without clearance from Mr. Hastings.

40
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,474


41
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,560
I can't let you through.
You haven't been coded out.

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,149
- I'm just going to my car.
- You'll have to talk to Mr. Hastings.

43
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,902
He's in the middle of a crisis.
It'll be a couple minutes.

44
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,320
No one will notice.

45
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,618
I just want to get my migraine meds.
Don't make me beg.

46
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,080
All right.

47
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,125
One of my men
will go grab your medication.

48
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,502
Give me your keys.

49
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,880
That's fine, your men are busy.
I'll talk to Hastings.

50
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,048
Sure?

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,845
Thank you, Jim.

52
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,732
One car left the parking garage.

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,651
One minute after the crash.

54
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,447
Northeast exit, a blonde was driving.
Hassan was probably in it.

55
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,908
- Can you track it?
- It left the satellite grid.

56
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,034
Damn it.
Put out an APB.

57
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,205
Scan the NSA servers.
See if they've picked up any chatter.

58
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,958
The President's on line one,
She'd like an update.

59
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,672
I saw the crash.
Tell me President Hassan survived.

60
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,341
Actually,
we learned he wasn't in the vehicle.

61
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,178
- I don't understand.
- <i>During the pursuit,</i>

62
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,807
he was switched to another car.
We're trying to track it.

63
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,392
- Then he's still alive.
- It appears so.

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,103
If they wanted him dead,
they would've kill him on site.

65
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,649
They must have another agenda.
I don't even want to speculate.

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,150
We will keep you apprised.

67
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,909
What is happening?

68
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,663
- Is my father alive?
- We think so.

69
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,667
But he's still
in the hands of the terrorists.

70
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,169
- Now, CTU is searching for him now.
- Then there's still hope.

71
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,422
Excuse me.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,301
The Russian Foreign Minister is here.
He wants to speak with you.

73
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,387
I'll be right there.

74
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,684
I can't imagine
how hard this is for both of you.

75
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,019
Please know that I'm committing

76
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,771
every resource at my disposal
to finding him.

77
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,660
Mr. Novakovich.
What can I do for you?

78
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,372
Thank you for seeing me.
I know that you are very busy.

79
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,666
It's all right.

80
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,672
Can I assume there is no change
in the status of President Hassan?

81
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,800
- I'm afraid not.
- Then he is still held by terrorists.

82
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,761
For now, yes.

83
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,555
Are you hopeful
that CTU can recover him?

84
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,726
We're following a lead.
And, yes, we are very hopeful.

85
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,686
What is the nature of the lead?

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,273
I'd rather not get into specifics.

87
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,984
You'll be told
the second we know more.

88
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,449
I must stress that if he's not found,
his government will be in disarray.

89
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,992
The peace agreement
will not succeed.

90
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,245
I'm aware of that.

91
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,957
There's no point in speculating
on the worse, we're not there yet.

92
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,626
I want to make our position clear.

93
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,545
If Hassan dies,
there is no agreement.

94
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,467
If I didn't know better,

95
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,094
I'd think you were hoping for that.

96
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,014
You believe this treaty
weakens your influence in the region.

97
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,642
You've been looking
for any excuse to pull out.

98
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,062
You are under
a great deal of pressure,

99
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,980
but these are baseless accusations.

100
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,565
We have been more than supportive.

101
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,570
We are here, are we not?

102
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,117
Perhaps I spoke too harshly.

103
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,372
I just don't need to be reminded
how perilous this situation is.

104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,000
I do appreciate your support,

105
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,172
and I hope that I can count on it
until we find President Hassan.

106
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,050
Of course.

107
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,937
Can I talk to you?

108
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,900
We have a problem.

109
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,071
Jack thinks someone at CTU
is working for the terrorists.

110
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,196
Why?

111
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,284
They were warned they were followed
and switched to a different car.

112
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,495
Yeah, that bothered me.

113
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,955
- Then there was a satellite glitch.
- What glitch?

114
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,583
That allowed them
to get away in the first place.

115
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,752
It was too unlucky,
especially for us.

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,088
Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone.

117
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,090
If someone tipped him off,
we can get the number.

118
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,218
Jack's on his way back.

119
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,678
Call him on a proprietary line
for the data.

120
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,098
- All right.
- Go.

121
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,873
I'm ready to receive.
I'm calling Jack now.

122
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:28,727
- This is Bauer.
- Renee filled me in.

123
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:31,329
Good, I'm going to upload
the phone data to your station.

124
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:33,634
- What's your I.D. number?
- 91770.

125
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:38,665
It's encrypted.
You'll have to work fast.

126
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:47,683
Excuse me,

127
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,010
- I need to access your workstation.
- What for?

128
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,387
To make sure the parameters
reset properly after the EMP.

129
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,432
- Can't that wait?
- No.

130
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,750
If the parameters are off,
we could lose more data.

131
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,562
- How long?
- Couple minutes.

132
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:01,980
Go ahead.

133
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,320
It's Chloe.

134
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,704
I need to talk to you at my station.
It's important.

135
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,534
- What is it?
- I'll explain when you get here.

136
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,446
I'm on my way.

137
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,248
Let me know when you're finished.

138
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,268
What is it?

139
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:39,059
We think someone inside of CTU
is working with the terrorists.

140
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,544
- What?
- They switched Hassan to another car.

141
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,398
They knew they were being followed.

142
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,608
Jack recovered Tarin's phone
from the crash.

143
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,485
Chloe's decrypting the data.

144
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,576
Who the hell is it?

145
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,110
The data's coming in now,
it'll take a second.

146
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,079
These are all the calls
that Tarin made in the past hour.

147
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,338
That's one of ours.
It's one of the cell phones

148
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:03,709
NSA provided to us
right after the EMP hit.

149
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,503
- Who was issued that phone?
- They were logged in by hand.

150
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,671
Hold on.

151
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,523
That's Dana's phone.

152
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,819
Where is she?

153
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,551
I checked with Hastings,
he cleared me through.

154
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,826
How's that migraine?

155
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,870
Worse than ever, thanks to you.

156
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:42,164
Sorry about that.
Just doing my job.

157
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:47,753
Stay where you are...

158
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,974
Security monitors, main screen.

159
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,979
We need a medical team.

160
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,482
Why is there a 112 out on Dana?

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,902
She's working with the terrorists.
Just shot two security guards.

162
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,363
- She's trying to leave the building.
- Wait a minute...

163
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,115
We traced a call from her phone
to one of the terrorists.

164
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,784
She's been working with them.

165
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,119
- What did you know about this?
- Nothing!

166
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:23,477
She just entered the parking garage.

167
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,410
She's heading for the end of level 2.
She's going for her car.

168
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,921
Notify Security,
lock down the exits.

169
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:34,323
Get out of the car now!

170
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,178
Who are you, you lying bitch?

171
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,243
Who are you?

172
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:46,496
Let her go!

173
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,832
Cole, let her go.

174
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:52,836
Let her go.

175
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:03,013
Where's Hassan?

176
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,506
You're going to talk to me
one way or the other.

177
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,396
Where are they taking him?

178
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,441
I want to talk to Jack Bauer.

179
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:19,978
You want answers...

180
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,740
get Bauer.

181
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,014
Get her out of here.

182
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,563
If her name's not Dana Walsh,
then who is she?

183
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:57,317
Her real name's Jenny Scott.

184
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,278
At least that's what she told me.

185
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,151
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

186
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:07,869
She said she did bad things in her past.
That's why she changed her identity.

187
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,121
What bad things?

188
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:12,088
She was involved with a felon.

189
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:14,891
They committed some armed robberies.

190
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,616
Someone got killed.

191
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:22,048
That's all I know,
but it's not relevant to finding Hassan.

192
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:24,428
You let me decide
what is relevant and what is not.

193
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,973
- Why didn't you report any of this?
- I found out about it a few hours ago.

194
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,558
That is not an excuse.

195
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,661
I know, sir.

196
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:40,238
I guess I was just trying
to protect her.

197
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:41,736
I wasn't thinking straight.

198
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:45,323
So when you and Dana
or whatever her name is... went AWOL,

199
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,941
what was that about?

200
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,821
It's a long story, sir,

201
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:52,080
and it won't help us
find President Hassan.

202
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,333
I'll make a full debrief
once this is all over, but until it is,

203
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,627
please, let me stay on duty.

204
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:02,674
I screwed up,
but I've been running Hassan's security

205
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,174
for the last month.

206
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,511
Give me a chance to make this right.

207
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:14,519
<i>You wanted to be told
when Bauer got here.</i>

208
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,426
<i>He just arrived.</i>

209
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:18,023
Send him to interrogation.

210
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,191
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

211
00:14:21,364 --> 00:14:23,778
- You get over to debrief.
- You need me on this.

212
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,240
I need people I can trust.
You want to make this right?

213
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,897
Then start by getting down
everything you know.

214
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:31,412
Then we'll talk.

215
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:46,426
You were right.
They had someone inside.

216
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,178
Dana Walsh.
She's an analyst.

217
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:50,096
We checked the phone data.

218
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,307
She called Tarin.
She must've warned him

219
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,435
- that he was being pursued.
- Anybody know who she really is?

220
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:57,896
She's not saying anything
until she talks to you.

221
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,736
Me? Why?

222
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:01,601
She won't say.

223
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:03,735
Are you up to speed?

224
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,977
I spoke with Ortiz.
You know he was her fiancé.

225
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:08,532
That would explain a few things.

226
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,159
He doesn't know much.
Only she had a criminal past

227
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,994
and altered her identity.

228
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:15,830
- Not an easy task.
- She obviously had help.

229
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,582
However, we need to find out.

230
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,418
- You think Cole's clean?
- I think he's telling the truth,

231
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,462
but after this, I'm not sure.

232
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,548
I thought I knew Dana Walsh.

233
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:26,049
Cole's clean.

234
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,802
Why does she want to talk to you?

235
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,413
Don't know.
Just met her today.

236
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,785
We should find out.

237
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,910
Open up.

238
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,468
You stand down for now.

239
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:45,902
Just so we're clear,
as far as I'm concerned,

240
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,779
I kept up my end of our deal.

241
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,447
The rods were recovered.

242
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,624
I'm still here
because I gave President Taylor my word

243
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,244
that I would protect Hassan.

244
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:55,662
I know.

245
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:57,349
Thank you.

246
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:02,352
Biometrics ready?

247
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,930
They said I was the only one
you wanted to talk to.

248
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:15,765
Why?

249
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:19,227
Because you're the only one
who doesn't have his head up his ass.

250
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,982
Let's not waste any time.
You want Hassan,

251
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,358
I can get him.

252
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,234
I know where they're taking him
and what they're planning to do.

253
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,071
What do you want?

254
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,241
You know the drill.
Full immunity, clean record.

255
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,280
And I want to be compensated.

256
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,164
- Compensated?
- When you get these IRK agents,

257
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,167
you'll get your hands on their cash.
I want my share.

258
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:46,349
I lost a lot of money
with this deal.

259
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,965
All of this is about money?

260
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,551
Isn't it always?

261
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,511
If I'm going to take this
to the President.

262
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,769
I need proof
you know something worthwhile.

263
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,938
In about a half an hour,
you'll have all the proof you need.

264
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:05,914
Hassan's head.

265
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,194
You little bitch.

266
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,699
- <i>Let me explain to you.</i>
- Damn it!

267
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,496
The only reason you've got any leverage
is because Hassan is alive.

268
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,498
So stop screwing with me!

269
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,960
They're going to force him
to make a statement,

270
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,586
then they're going to kill him,

271
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,050
live over the Internet.

272
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,883
I suggest we stop haggling

273
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,201
and you start making this happen.

274
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:40,463
Fine.

275
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,435
I'll take this to the President.

276
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,562
But you better understand

277
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:46,604
that if we don't recover

278
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,399
Hassan alive...

279
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,360
you get nothing.

280
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:53,341
Nothing.

281
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:57,951
It's why I asked for you.

282
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:00,370
It's part of the deal.

283
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,871
You'll handle this operation.

284
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,957
Hassan is heavily protected.

285
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,042
I need your experience
to running the show.

286
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,746
There's been enough screwups.

287
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:12,674
Don't you think?

288
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:16,261
You said you lost a lot of money
because the deal went bad.

289
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,308
Who was supposed to pay you?

290
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:21,579


291
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,946
You're running out of time.

292
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,196
What do the biometrics say?

293
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,906
Stable.
No deception.

294
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:39,701
I wouldn't put much faith.
She's a sociopath.

295
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:41,170
She can't be trusted.

296
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,414
This isn't about the money.
She's hiding something.

297
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:47,333
But given our time-frame,
we need to follow through with this.

298
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:48,877
How?

299
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,778
We need to call the President.

300
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:18,216
He's here.

301
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,021
They're bringing him up.

302
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:23,275
We should kill him now.
The entire city is looking for him.

303
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,531
It's not enough to kill him.

304
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,851
We need him to confess his crimes,

305
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,047
- renounce his lies.
- The longer we delay,

306
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:32,230
the better the chance
the Americans will find him.

307
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,482
He'll never be rescued.

308
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:36,442
He will die,

309
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:38,278
right here.

310
00:20:58,595 --> 00:20:59,716
Do you remember me?

311
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,596
I was a young man when we met.

312
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:08,470
You were a general
in the Revolutionary Guard.

313
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,645
I had the honor of briefing you
on our operations in Abul Province.

314
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,443
You were a great leader then.

315
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,240
What happened?

316
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:26,963
Why did you turn your back
on our country?

317
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:32,997
It is you...

318
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:37,629
you who has betrayed our country.

319
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,919
No.

320
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,800
I'm fighting to keep us strong.

321
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:45,445
You have chosen
to surrender to the West.

322
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,971
It's not surrender.

323
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:50,246
It's an honorable peace...

324
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:53,061
that will strengthen our country.

325
00:21:55,243 --> 00:21:56,643
I do remember you.

326
00:21:57,512 --> 00:22:00,585
Do you remember
the campaign we fought to secure

327
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,674
the perimeter of Abul?

328
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:05,406
Yes, I do.

329
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:08,493
The other generals said
I was leading my men into defeat.

330
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,244
But we fought.

331
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:12,262
For four long days.

332
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:16,291
I believed in my heart
that victory was possible.

333
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,759
And I was right.

334
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,893
I'm not saying I'm never wrong.

335
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:30,323
But I believe...

336
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:33,637
just as strongly
in this peace agreement.

337
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:38,693
All I'm asking...

338
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:42,151
is that you put your faith in me
once again.

339
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:48,551
I implore you to stop this madness.

340
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,320
The next thing you say...

341
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:08,589
will be an apology
to every citizen of the IRK.

342
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,849
You will beg forgiveness
for your treason,

343
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,996
and you will renounce
the peace agreement.

344
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:17,596
That will never happen.

345
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,725
I'll never do that.

346
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,305
I will never do that.

347
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:25,623
Oh, you will.

348
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,409
It just depends
on how long it takes.

349
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:32,132
And how much pain you can endure.

350
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,185
This immunity agreement
is made out to "Dana Walsh."

351
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,599
But it's my understanding
that's not her real name.

352
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,494
The lawyers are aware of that,
ma'am.

353
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,366
They say the agreement will hold.

354
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,491
Too bad.

355
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:14,105
I thought for a moment there
we had a way out.

356
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:18,399
I'll get these to CTU right away.

357
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,691
Thank you, Tim.

358
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,493
Thank you.

359
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,468
Ethan.

360
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:32,845
Still here, Madam President.

361
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,308
Are you going to be all right?

362
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:40,144
I'll let my doctors field that one.

363
00:24:40,484 --> 00:24:42,438
- They're running tests.
- Good.

364
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,575
Madam President,

365
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,083
what's the situation with Hassan?
Is he safe?

366
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,239
They have him, Ethan.

367
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,824
The IRK agents have Hassan.

368
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:57,286
Oh, dear God.
They're going to kill him.

369
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,783
Not if CTU can get there in time.

370
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:02,797
There's a rescue operation underway.

371
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:05,635
- They know where he is?
- They will shortly.

372
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:09,823
The terrorists had someone
working for them inside CTU...

373
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:12,009
an analyst named Dana Walsh.
I've agreed

374
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,721
to a conditional immunity deal
in exchange for her cooperation.

375
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:17,348
Conditional on what?

376
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,517
Omar Hassan's safe return.

377
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,688
Ethan...

378
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:28,025
There's a real possibility
Hassan won't survive this.

379
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,090
I hate to even think about it,
but we have to be prepared.

380
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:33,559
Is there any chance

381
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:37,327
that the person who succeeds Hassan
will be someone we can deal with?

382
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,914
The IRK constitution is vague
when it comes to succession of power.

383
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,685
There's no telling
who'd take his place.

384
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,710
Besides,

385
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:50,298
Hassan barely was able to form
a consensus in his own administration.

386
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,508
It took a man of his...

387
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,094
charisma and passion
to achieve that.

388
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:59,223
I'm sorry to be so negative,
Madam President,

389
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,236
but we have to be realistic.

390
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:04,645
Without Hassan,
there can be no peace.

391
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:13,953
They're ready to start the briefing
with Dana... or whatever her name is.

392
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,733
- Arlo?
- Yeah. I heard you.

393
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,310
You work with someone for a year.
How did we all miss this?

394
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,993
I knew there was something wrong.
She was a little too perfect.

395
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:25,875
But I never imagined
she'd be a terrorist.

396
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,395
I should've seen it.

397
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,195
She was acting weird all day.

398
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:31,332
Maybe if I'd been looking
in the right spot,

399
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,534
like somewhere
in the vicinity of her face,

400
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,670
I might've noticed something useful.

401
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,720
She played us.
Get over it.

402
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:45,516
Sit down.

403
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:53,277
I'm only telling you this
because you're going to find out

404
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,545
soon enough.

405
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,352
Dana's been given
provisional immunity by the President.

406
00:26:58,477 --> 00:27:00,864
- What?
- She's providing us with intelligence

407
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:03,564
as to the whereabouts of the
people holding President Hassan.

408
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,916
I don't care what she's providing.
She's a traitor and a murderer!

409
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,877
- Cole...
- You can't let her walk! Not her!

410
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,045
Stop.

411
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,715
I know you've been burned...

412
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,005
professionally, personally.

413
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,387
Get over it.

414
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:24,019
Jack Bauer's heading up the operation
to rescue President Hassan.

415
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,810
He wants you on his team.

416
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:28,062
But Dana

417
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,830
is briefing the group.

418
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:31,649
Do you have a problem with that?

419
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:35,028
No, sir.

420
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,153
I'm fine.

421
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,082
Good.

422
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,247
Stand by outside
the conference room.

423
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:51,372
His name is Samir Mehran.

424
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,587
Before the IRK planted him here,

425
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,829
he was a soldier
with the Revolutionary Guard.

426
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:58,384
Altogether,
he has about six men left.

427
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,927
You killed the rest.

428
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,392
You're sure
that's where they're holding Hassan?

429
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,436
Yes.
The entrance to the tenement

430
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,838
is on Holland Avenue
with exits to the rear and east side.

431
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:14,358
He'll have at least
a couple lookouts stationed.

432
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,694
- What's the apartment number?
- I don't know.

433
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,840
- What's the apartment number?
- If I knew, I would tell you.

434
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:21,782
Somewhere above the first floor.

435
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,412
- What makes you say that?
- Because the building is populated.

436
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,737
Some families.

437
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,116
Samir will want to use them
as human shields

438
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,233
in the event of a frontal attack.

439
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,713
We got what we need.
We have to move.

440
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:37,757
Secure the prisoner.

441
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,217
Take her to holding.

442
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,664
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm ready to go.

443
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,905
Get your men
and assemble them in the motor pool.

444
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,154
Let's move.

445
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:56,605
Let's go.

446
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:36,565
Just read the statement, Omar.

447
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:39,703
Put an end to this.

448
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:43,992
This is only going to get worse.

449
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:47,451
Tell the people
you've made a terrible mistake.

450
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:49,537
Atone for your sins.

451
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:54,492
You are wasting your time.

452
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,799
I will never do what you ask.

453
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,237
Read the statement, Omar,

454
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:26,115
or I will start cutting pieces
from your body.

455
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:30,856
Whether I live...

456
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,001
or I die...

457
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,667
this peace will happen somehow.

458
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:41,088
And men like you
will have no place to hide.

459
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,556
This peace dies right here with you!

460
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,850
You said the drug
would break down his resistance.

461
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,301
- It should be working.
- Give him another injection.

462
00:30:52,426 --> 00:30:54,954
- Any more could kill him.
- I don't care.

463
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,645
Do it.

464
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,483
Samir,

465
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,958
we can't continue this forever.

466
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:06,034
If he won't read the statement,
we must think of something else.

467
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:08,073
He will break.

468
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:11,410
- I know it.
- He's stronger than we thought.

469
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:13,704
We need to accept it.

470
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Stop.

471
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,296
Prepare the Internet feed.

472
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:24,590
What are you going to do?

473
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:27,259
I will tell the world of his crimes.

474
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:31,283
And carry out his sentence.

475
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,643
Madam President,
I just got word from CTU.

476
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:43,131
Their tactical team is approaching
the staging area.

477
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:45,210
They also have real-time uplink.

478
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,156
Dalia and Kayla Hassan
have asked to speak with you.

479
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,698
They're in the waiting area.

480
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:58,332
I was told you found my husband.

481
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,865
He's being held
in an apartment building.

482
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,042
CTU is preparing to go in after him.

483
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,755
Do they know if he's still alive?

484
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,758
We believe that he is,
but we can't be sure.

485
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:11,720
We have our best men in the field
and they're going to do everything

486
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,307
to save your husband's life.

487
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,558
But you cannot guarantee
he will be saved.

488
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:17,685
I'm afraid not.

489
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,910
But I assure you,
we're going to do everything we can.

490
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:23,899
Thank you, Madam President.

491
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:28,195
Madam President,
we need you in the situation room.

492
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:31,198
We'll know something very soon.

493
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,834
NSA just red-flagged a live feed
going out on the Internet.

494
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,766
It's President Hassan.

495
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:49,847
Put it through.

496
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:55,931
<i>President Hassan
is a traitor to his country.</i>

497
00:32:56,984 --> 00:32:59,830
<i>His belief
that we must capitulate to the infidels</i>

498
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:02,771
<i>nearly condemned our people
to a life of subjugation.</i>

499
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:06,049
<i>What follows
is a list of his crimes.</i>

500
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:10,140
<i>You will see that he deserves
the harshest punishment.</i>

501
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:12,281
<i>Hassan has tortured</i>

502
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,452
<i>and sent his bulldogs
on other leaders of the society...</i>

503
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,577
<i>The scholars...</i>

504
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,802
Does the video give us any clue
to Hassan's location in the building?

505
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:22,458
Look at the shadows behind his head.

506
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,028
The light coming from the left
is natural light. It's a window.

507
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,482
You're sure that's daylight?

508
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,634
Yes, the light temperature
is 5600 degrees Kelvin.

509
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:34,845
That's the building where Dana
said Hassan is being held.

510
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,474
Based on the angle of the shadows,
they're in an east-facing apartment.

511
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:41,518
By the height of the nearby buildings,
they're on the fourth floor.

512
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,939
The drone is in position.
There are two lookouts on the roof.

513
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,116
Patch me through to Jack.

514
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:00,714
It's Bauer.

515
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,116
Jack, we've got a good fix
on Hassan's location.

516
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,168
We think he's in an east-facing
apartment on the fourth floor.

517
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,123
We also confirm two look-outs
on the roof, both armed.

518
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,541
North and south corner.

519
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,599
- Copy that.
- You need to hurry, Jack.

520
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,802
The terrorist is running
a live Internet feed.

521
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,454
He's reading a list
of Hassan's so-called crimes.

522
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,649
As soon as he's done,
he's going to execute him.

523
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:22,226
We're at the staging area;
I'll let you know when we're moving in.

524
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,603
Is this everyone?

525
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,106
You'll take down the lookouts.

526
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,818
Coordinated shots
and I want you to cover our perimeter.

527
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,695
Charters, Bank, you'll be with me.

528
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,449
We'll use audio surveillance to locate
where they're holding Hassan.

529
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,492
Silence your weapons.

530
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,161
The only way this operation works
is by surprise.

531
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,873
They feel we're moving in on them,
President Hassan is dead.

532
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,836
You know what we're up against,
and the significance of this operation.

533
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,963
Trust your training.
Let's do it.

534
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,800
Check your comms,
meet at rally points in two minutes.

535
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,510
I need to talk to you.

536
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,684
- I want you on the assault team.
- I'm not running ops?

537
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,313
I need every agent
with experience on this.

538
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,316
But this is
against every instinct I have.

539
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,237
Promise me you'll stay right behind
and do exactly as I say.

540
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,076
- I need you to promise me.
- I promise.

541
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,911
Get ready.

542
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,763
Target A acquired.

543
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,765
<i>B Target moving towards you.</i>

544
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,725
<i>20 feet...</i>

545
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,479
- <i>10 feet...</i>
- On my mark.

546
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,194
Now.

547
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,323
<i>Lookouts are down, you're clear.</i>

548
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,242
- Moving in towards the building.
- <i>We see you.</i>

549
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,412
<i>It's become a tool for truth-hiding,</i>

550
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,747
<i>misinformation
and propaganda for his regime.</i>

551
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,771
<i>... openly supports the masked</i>

552
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,980
<i>poisonous vipers of America.</i>

553
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,572
<i>This man is not our President!</i>

554
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,658
<i>He's an arrogant pretender
who'd sell our women and children</i>

555
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,535
<i>to the infidels of the West.</i>

556
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,456
<i>His terrible crimes
against our people demand retribution!</i>

557
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,750
<i>We're not terrorists,</i>

558
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,628
<i>as President Taylor
and her other rats would label us.</i>

559
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,507
Don't move.

560
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,969
Federal agent.
Get down on the ground.

561
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,681


562
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,433


563
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,868
We had a hostile on the second floor.
Still good to go?

564
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,578
Still good.

565
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,538
Cover that, we need to move.

566
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,834
<i>... corruption and promiscuity
and bringing back foreign domination.</i>

567
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,673
<i>This is the dog
we sent to speak for our country.</i>

568
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,215
<i>He's Taylor's puppet!</i>

569
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,507
That's it.

570
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,087
It's all right.

571
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,922
We're not here to hurt you.

572
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,594
Where's your mommy and daddy?

573
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,805
Federal agent.
On the ground.

574
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,142
One more word and I'll kill you.

575
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,190
On the couch.

576
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,696
Samir's wrapping it up.
Get in there right now!

577
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,351
<i>Taylor and her country
want to strip our nation of progress</i>

578
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,020
<i>and defense capabilities.</i>

579
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,999
<i>And Hassan's own greed-fueled lies
and promises...</i>

580
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,627
Visual on Hassan.

581
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,211
Ready to engage.

582
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,433
<i>... if your homes were occupied.</i>

583
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,352
<i>We have thousands of volunteers</i>

584
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,812
<i>who are willing to give their lives.</i>

585
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,777
<i>All he sought to create</i>

586
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,738
<i>is a hollow, soulless nation.</i>

587
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,079
<i>You will soon hear the cry
to rise up and renew.</i>

588
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,332
<i>We will take back our country.</i>

589
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,669
<i>Remember this day
as the beginning of a revolution.</i>

590
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,673
<i>It is the day
we eliminated a tyrant.</i>

591
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,510
<i>Hassan has torn us apart, muzzled us,
divided us with his condescending</i>

592
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,971
<i>peace treaty of subjugation
to the Americans.</i>

593
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,893
<i>For this treachery,
the penalty is death.</i>

594
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,396
I'm sorry.

595
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,691
<i>I will carry out
this sentence myself.</i>

596
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,571
<i>The time has come for this criminal</i>

597
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,822
<i>to pay.</i>

598
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,622
<i>Our country demands justice.</i>

599
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,957
<i>Omar Hassan</i>

600
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,919
<i>shall pay with his own blood.</i>

601
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,052
<i>Talk to me.</i>

602
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,764
The statement was prerecorded.

603
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,016
He was already dead.

604
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,297
Call CTU.
I want to know what went wrong.

605
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,634
And clear the screens.

606
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,107
We were too late.

607
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,235
We weren't able to save him.

608
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,654
Sorry.
