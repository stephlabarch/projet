3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,513
Who are you looking for?

4
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:17,183
Someone who can give me
the names of everyone else involved.

5
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,463
Break the story
in case I don't make it.

6
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:21,896
If Dalia Hassan finds out

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,313
that the Russians had a hand
in her husband's dead,

8
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:25,566
she'll never sign.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,234
<i>I've to speak to Dalia.</i>

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,654
It's about the people
who murdered your father.

11
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,197
We know who is responsible.

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,532
What you don't know is,
those people were working under

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,159
<i>the orders of Russian agents.</i>

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,911
Bauer made contact

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,529
with Meredith Reed.

16
00:00:39,193 --> 00:00:40,081
You need

17
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,307
to call her publisher and demand
that they do not run the story.

18
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,670
You're suggesting
muzzling the press?

19
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,856
If you don't use
the power of your office

20
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,659
to shut this story down,

21
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:52,885
your peace agreement
won't be the only casualty.

22
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,221
I need you to contact the FBI.

23
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:57,030
Have them locate Reed

24
00:00:57,155 --> 00:01:00,309
and seize whatever evidence
she purports to have.

25
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,144
Meredith Reed? FBI.

26
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,188
- You're under arrest.
- Let's go.

27
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,191
You were right about Jack.
He is working with somebody.

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,610
It's James Ricker, ex-CIA op.

29
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,404
He lives on Mercer Street.

30
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,524
He's not gonna be happy
we tracked him down.

31
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:17,118
I need you to talk to him.
Get him to tell us where Jack is.

32
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,245
Are you good,
or have you still not taken sides?

33
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,831
I want to expose this cover-up
as much as you. I'm in.

34
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,211
That's Jack Bauer!

35
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,467
Get up
or I will kill you right here.

36
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:35,080
You know the name of the person
in the Russian government who's leading.

37
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:37,596
I want that name.
Give me the name!

38
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,099
I'll tell you.
Mikhail Novakovich!

39
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,985
Where's Novakovich?

40
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,144
He's dead.

41
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:44,645
Bauer came in shooting.

42
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,022
Mikhail Novakovich was just murdered

43
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:48,384
<i>by Jack Bauer.</i>

44
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,509
What?

45
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:52,445
As far as, Bauer is concerned,

46
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,440
<i>the trail ended with Novakovich.</i>

47
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,699
Then Bauer has no idea

48
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,994
- that he was operating under my orders?
- <i>None.</i>

49
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,705
<i>If you're so worried about Bauer,
you never should</i>

50
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,207
<i>have given the order
to kill Renee Walker.</i>

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,318
I just picked up a preliminary flash.
Jack murdered Novakovich at his hotel,

52
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,526
and six of his security guards.

53
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,132
According to a witness,
Jack killed all seven men on his own.

54
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,824
Then fell right back off the radar.

55
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:41,827
Eden can't find any trace of him.

56
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:43,370
Does Chloe know about this?

57
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,642
I just talked to her,
she should be at the UN any minute.

58
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:50,711
I know that we need
this evidence that Jack has,

59
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,227
but this crime scene
is a slaughterhouse.

60
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:55,785
Does Chloe really still
think she can pull this off?

61
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,676
If anyone can talk Jack down,
it's Chloe.

62
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,001
And if she can't?

63
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,263
We're both prepared to do
whatever it takes.

64
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,141
Even when Novakovich's
whole security staff couldn't?

65
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,725
What do you want me to do?

66
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,645
The truth about today
needs to get out,

67
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,104
and that's not going to happen
unless we get to Jack.

68
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm coming up on Ricker's apartment.
I'm going in.

69
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,860
Ricker went to a lot of trouble
to disappear.

70
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:18,739
He's not going to like
that you found him.

71
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,657
I'm not expecting him to.

72
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,213
<i>You're looking at the UN Plaza gardens
and the podium from which</i>

73
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,842
<i>all three co-sponsors of the peace
treaty will address the public</i>

74
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:42,090
<i>following a private signing ceremony
inside the UN Council Chamber</i>

75
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:45,434
<i>Russian President Yuri Suvarov,
the third co-sponsor of the treaty,</i>

76
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:49,603
<i>is en route to the UN
where he will join President Taylor</i>

77
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,366
<i>and acting IRK President
Dalia Hassan...</i>

78
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,407
This is Agent Ortiz, CTU!
Open that door.

79
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,379
Before you pull that trigger,
you ought to know this.

80
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,590
I don't place a call in 15 minutes,

81
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,302
every intelligence agency
in the country gets alerted about you.

82
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:06,176
Weapon charges alone
will get you locked up for the duration,

83
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:09,285
Or you can help us find Jack Bauer,

84
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,809
and we'll keep our mouths shut.

85
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:17,358
You think you're protecting him?

86
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,153
The order on Jack Bauer
is shoot to kill.

87
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:24,323
He knew
what he was getting himself into.

88
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,784
Jack's not thinking straight.

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,119
Look, I read your file.

90
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,761
I know Jack saved your life
in Damascus.

91
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:35,250
This is your opportunity
to pay back that debt.

92
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:38,078
You know how this
is gonna end, right?

93
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,203
Do you?

94
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,276
If Jack dies today,

95
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,419
it's on you.

96
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:02,708
Wait a minute.

97
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,067
Wait a minute.

98
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:17,742
Thanks, Adam.

99
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,818
Agent Burke. I have the revised
security assessment for you.

100
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,894
I noticed that Ortiz's name
was back on the duty roster.

101
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,143
That's right.

102
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,062
He was arrested
for helping Jack Bauer.

103
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,654
I got him a temporary clearance
so he could help us.

104
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,391
He was the one who designed
the UN protocols in the first place.

105
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:43,527
I know.

106
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,048
Do you really think
we can trust him?

107
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:49,199
I wouldn't have gotten him
a release if I didn't.

108
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:52,773
Excuse me.

109
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:59,960
- What happened?
- <i>Not good.</i>

110
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:02,337
I think Jack's targeting Suvarov.

111
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,839
Is that what Ricker said?

112
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,383
Yeah. Jack planted a bug
on Charles Logan,

113
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,343
overheard a conversation
between them.

114
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:11,346
Suvarov's the one who gave the order
for Renee to be killed.

115
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,142
Does Ricker have a recording
of that conversation?

116
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,062
No. He wiped his system clean
as soon as he saw me coming.

117
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:21,941
But the surveillance rig he gave Jack
makes a backup, so Jack has a copy.

118
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,400
Good.
We're gonna need it.

119
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,337
- Why?
- Meredith Reed has been arrested.

120
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,280
They confiscated a data card
from her.

121
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:30,863
- Dana's evidence.
- Exactly.

122
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,619
The recording that Jack has
is the only proof we have now.

123
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,049
I don't know that getting proof
is our first priority anymore.

124
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:40,709
We have to put an alert out on Jack.

125
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,791
If we do that,
Pillar will get to him first.

126
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,005
He'll kill Jack,
and he'll destroy the recording.

127
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:48,509
We can't stand by and let Jack
assassinate the president of Russia.

128
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:53,388
No, but we can buy ourselves time.

129
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,101
Can change Suvarov's
motorcade route,

130
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,229
sequester him in the UN. Make it
impossible for Jack to get to him.

131
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,856
Except Suvarov's gonna
be standing at that podium soon,

132
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,457
and once he's exposed like that,
we can't protect him.

133
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,625
That's not happening
for over an hour.

134
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,996
If we haven't found Jack by then,
we put out the alert.

135
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,965
It's still taking a big risk, Chloe.

136
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,200
I know.

137
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,148
Get Suvarov's route changed.

138
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:17,955
But I'm in charge of his security
as soon as he gets to the UN.

139
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,876
- How far out are you?
- I'll be there in ten.

140
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:43,924
Sir, the flash
about Novakovich is going out.

141
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,655
You wanted to speak with the president
before that happened.

142
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,283
Thank you, Jason.

143
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:52,823
Do we know anything about Bauer?

144
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:54,324
No. Nothing.

145
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:58,503
If you don't mind me asking, sir.
What are you going to tell Taylor?

146
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:03,611
I think it's time she...

147
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:05,335
she knows everything.

148
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:15,716
All the delegates are present
except Suvarov, who's still in transit.

149
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:18,056
He'll be given the details
once he arrives.

150
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:22,069
Excuse me.

151
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:27,774
I'm about to go into the meeting.
What's going on?

152
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,859
I wanted you to hear this news
from me first.

153
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,235
What news?

154
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,790
<i>I tried to insulate you
as long as I could,</i>

155
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:35,866
preserve your plausible
deniability, but...

156
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,659
Tell me what you're talking about.

157
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,673
Jack Bauer isn't just trying
to gather evidence

158
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,130
about the conspiracy.

159
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:46,960
He's seeking retribution.

160
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:50,756
Go on.

161
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:53,613
Bauer just murdered
Mikhail Novakovich,

162
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:55,782
along with a good number
of his staff.

163
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:59,303
So Novakovich was responsible
for the assassination

164
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,974
of President Hassan?

165
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:08,869
Novakovich was the ranking member
of the Russian Delegation.

166
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:11,954
President Suvarov is going
to demand an explanation.

167
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:15,819
Actually, he's not.

168
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:19,933
Are you telling me

169
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:23,059
that Hassan's murder goes
all the way up to Suvarov?

170
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:28,167
But the good news is
that Bauer doesn't know that.

171
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:30,124
How can you be sure?

172
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:33,423
Because according to a witness,
Bauer killed Novakovich

173
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:36,108
<i>before he could talk.</i>

174
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:40,628
<i>And aside from me, Novakavich
is the only person who ever knew</i>

175
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,641
<i>that Suvarov was calling the shots.</i>

176
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,685
<i>Madam President, Bauer's finished</i>

177
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:49,067
what he started, Suvarov will be happy
to sweep this under the rug.

178
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:52,087
And the peace agreement
can go forward as planned.

179
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,212
This is...

180
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,613
Really, we couldn't have
asked for a better outcome.

181
00:10:57,254 --> 00:11:00,144
Except that I am asking
Dalia Hassan to shake hands

182
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,992
with her husband's murderer.

183
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:03,718
Call Suvarov.

184
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,781
Tell him that I am aware
of his involvement in this,

185
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:11,808
and that I will see him
at the signing.

186
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,098
My apologies.

187
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:30,036
Thank you for waiting.

188
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,944
- How did the call go?
- I told the president

189
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,362
about Suvarov's involvement, and...

190
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:43,001
she understood... not that
she has an alternative.

191
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,661
That's good news.

192
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,748
<i>Your new Secret Service detail's here
to escort you to the UN.</i>

193
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:53,404
It's been a long road, but...

194
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,469
we're almost there.

195
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,499
Anything new on Bauer?

196
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,326
A security camera picked him up
leaving Novakovich's hotel.

197
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:27,119
Confirmed what Berkov told us.

198
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,592
Bauer was definitely wounded
during the attack.

199
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:30,717
How badly?

200
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,776
He's gonna need treatment.

201
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:34,920
Getting alerts out
to medical facilities now.

202
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:38,779
Let Port Authority and INS know Bauer
might be trying to escape.

203
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:41,115
We'll find him...
It's only a question of time.

204
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:43,619
Maybe a little quicker
than you thought.

205
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:48,574
Slowly, take your weapon out
and pass it back to me.

206
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,519
Slowly.

207
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,794
Start the car and drive.

208
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,576
You saw what I did to Pavel.
I didn't have a time.

209
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,409
You, I've got all the time
in the world.

210
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,953
So you either do what I say,
or I will take you apart

211
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,962
piece by piece.
Now, drive!

212
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,500
- Where are we going?
- The UN.

213
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,875
Why?
You already got what you wanted.

214
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,307
- You killed everyone involved.
- Save your breath.

215
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,466
I know about President Suvarov.

216
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:48,106
Your delegations will be joining
you at the reception

217
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,911
after the post-signing ceremony.

218
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,333
And finally,

219
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:53,628
on behalf of the UN staff,

220
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,582
I would like to say
that we are all honored

221
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:58,628
to be part
of this historic occasion.

222
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,458
Thank you for your time.

223
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:11,766
Your daughter's been waiting
outside to speak to you.

224
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,410
She says it's important.

225
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,388
Let her know I'll be right there.

226
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:27,114
I have something for you.

227
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,657
It's from Omar.

228
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,537
He wanted to give it to you

229
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,997
to sign the agreement...

230
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,003
I'm grateful
that I can do so on his behalf.

231
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:44,382
It reads:

232
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,051
"All religions,

233
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:47,934
"all this singing,

234
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,137
"one song,

235
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,223
"peace be with you."

236
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:59,392
It is a verse
Omar would quote from Rumi

237
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:02,734
when he was talking about what
you and he were trying to achieve.

238
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,987
Thank you for seeing this through

239
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:09,452
and for helping us all
do justice to his memory.

240
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,920
I am honored.

241
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,640
I'm very honored.

242
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,655
Kayla, what is it?

243
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,199
Meredith Reed called
the residence looking for you.

244
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,574
I am not interested
in that woman's condolences.

245
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,121
That is not why she called.

246
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,788
She says she has information

247
00:15:57,913 --> 00:16:00,116
about the people who are
behind Father's murder.

248
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,502
But we know who was behind
your father's death...

249
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,254
extremists in our country.

250
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,632
She claims
that they had outside help.

251
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,466
That the Russians were involved.

252
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:10,301
Why would she say such a thing?

253
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,596
Does she have evidence,
or is this a rumor?

254
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,986
I don't know, but it can't have been
easy for her to call you.

255
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,435
I don't think
it's because of a rumor.

256
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,741
- What else did she say?
- She wouldn't say anything more

257
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,064
until she talked to you.

258
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,208
She left her number.

259
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,894
Let's call her from the residence.

260
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,171
President Suvarov's
motorcade is delayed

261
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,256
five minutes, put out an all-agency.

262
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,841
How do you want it coded?

263
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,177
Eyes only.

264
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,931
Lanza, make sure Burke reports here

265
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,061
with a set of tactical gear
for Agent Ortiz.

266
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,521
Arlo's at CTU,
running the surveillance video

267
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,991
through facial recognition.
Still no sign of Jack.

268
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:07,233
I've been thinking.

269
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,028
Let's say this file are from Jack.
What are we supposed to do?

270
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,773
If the president's willing
to lock down Meredith Reed...

271
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:14,856
She can't shut down every media,

272
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,743
which is where
we're gonna send this file.

273
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:19,746
We're also gonna send it
to every government employee.

274
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,332
Legislative, military, judiciary...
a lot of people.

275
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,125
How?

276
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,754
By using CTU servers,
we can distribute it simultaneously.

277
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,131
President Taylor
won't be able to stop the truth.

278
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,361
Good to see you.

279
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:37,555
Do you have the revised protocol
for President Suvarov's arrival?

280
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,974
We're bringing the motorcade
into the FDR Drive ramp.

281
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,686
Make sure that Agent Ortiz
has the revised protocols.

282
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,354
He's back in charge.

283
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,754
Let's take a look.

284
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,560
We're going to the Hart Building.

285
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,478
I want you to park underground.

286
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,486
This guard's life is in your hands.

287
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,113
One move that I don't like,

288
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,656
I'm gonna kill you both.

289
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:44,289


290
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,427
There's no one inside
since two hours ago.

291
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:00,472
Yeah, I'm just running
a last-minute security check.

292
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:02,384
Of course, sir.

293
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,354
Anything else?

294
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:13,537
No. Thank you.

295
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:18,865
Drive.

296
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:31,662
Pull in over here.

297
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,773
Slowly, with your right hand,

298
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:44,748
take the keys out of the ignition
and pass them back.

299
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,265
Get out of the car.

300
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:54,631
Now!

301
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,320
Close the door.

302
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,179
Put your hands on the roof.

303
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,825
Don't you move.

304
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,371
Suvarov's not gonna be out
on the podium for another hour.

305
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,581
You're not gonna make it that long.

306
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:15,463
Slowly,

307
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,270
back up towards me.

308
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,162
Stop.

309
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,575
Turn around.

310
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,456
You're gonna suture me up.

311
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:40,096
You try and make a move on me,
the slightest twitch,

312
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,783
I will put a bullet in your brain.
You got it?

313
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:01,718
I don't understand something.

314
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,345
You've spent your entire career
outside the system,

315
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,389
you've always had a good reason.

316
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:08,469
But this...

317
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:09,934
it's just blood lost.

318
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,645
You're destroying an agreement
that took years.

319
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,834
An agreement made by
murderers and liars.

320
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:17,233
Murderers?

321
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:20,528
You're the one killing people
in cold blood.

322
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,573
Everybody I took out had
a hand in today's attack.

323
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,825
But who makes you judge and jury?

324
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:29,066
President Taylor,
when she agreed to the cover-up.

325
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,643
I would have accepted justice
by law...

326
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,479
but that was taken away from me
by people like you.

327
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:38,893
So you're right,

328
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:41,051
I am judge and jury.

329
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,070
Now, step back.

330
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,195
Turn around.

331
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:48,835
Start to move back towards the car.

332
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,993
I came in after Hassan,
Walker were killed.

333
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:52,585
I'm not responsible for that.

334
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,998
- Get on your knees!
- I'm telling you the truth.

335
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:56,439
I've got a family.

336
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:57,928
Shut up.

337
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,361
Bauer, please, I have a little girl.
I have a daughter. She's six.

338
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,179
Please.
Don't do this.

339
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:56,889
Still no answer.

340
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,085
Are you sure
this is Meredith Reed's number?

341
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,541
- It's the right number.
- Then why isn't she answering?

342
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,007
I just talked to Gary Klausner,
Ms. Reed's editor.

343
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,898
He doesn't know where she is
and has no way to reach her.

344
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:09,554
He seemed very anxious
to get off the phone.

345
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:17,353
You leave?

346
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,068
I'm supposed
to be sitting across the table

347
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:22,469
from Yuri Suvav
in less than an hour.

348
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:25,020
If his government was involved,

349
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:27,195
President Taylor needs to know.

350
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,264
<i>Following the death of Omar Hassan,</i>

351
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:38,004
<i>President Suvarov
was reportedly pessimistic</i>

352
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,001
<i>about the viability
of the peace treaty.</i>

353
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,341
<i>But rumors of a Russian withdrawal</i>

354
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:44,756
<i>were soon dismissed
by the White House.</i>

355
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,924
<i>Suvarov is expected
to arrive at the UN.</i>

356
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:48,301
Yes?

357
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:50,261


358
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,184
It's Dalia Hassan.

359
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,681
I'll call her back.

360
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,183
She's outside, ma'am.

361
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,101
She says it's urgent.

362
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,023
Okay.

363
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,249
Madam President, forgive me.

364
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,352
I have just heard something
that is very disturbing.

365
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:25,505
What did you hear?

366
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:29,118
That the Russian government,
or people within the Russian government,

367
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:30,632
were involved

368
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,744
in the murder of my husband.

369
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:35,236
Where did you hear this?

370
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:39,311
My daughter received a phone call
from the journalist, Meredith Reed.

371
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,562
Have you spoken with h?

372
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:46,246
I've tried everything,
but I've been unable to reach her.

373
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,632
I came here to ask for your help
finding Miss Reed.

374
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:53,574
I need to know
if there is any truth in what she said.

375
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:59,956
We heard a rumor about the Russians
being involved as well.

376
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,625
And you didn't tell me?

377
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:07,320
Because we looked into it and found
that there was nothing backing it up.

378
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:08,923
It was a frivolous accusation.

379
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:13,177
Whatever else she may be,
Meredith Reed is not a frivolous woman.

380
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,723
She came to me,

381
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,048
someone she knew
would have every reason to doubt her.

382
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,235
I know that you want answers...

383
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:26,858
but we are signing the agreement
in less than an hour.

384
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:30,319
I feel
like you're not listening to me.

385
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,789
Before I sign a treaty with...

386
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:35,352
people who may have murdered
my husband,

387
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:37,527
I need help finding this woman.

388
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:42,794
I will do the best I can
in the time that we have left.

389
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,487
I don't think
I'm making myself clear.

390
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:49,922
Until I determine if it's true,
I will not sign this treaty.

391
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:54,510
Please, be reasonable.

392
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,345
This is my position,
Madam President.

393
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,972
I will not change my mind.

394
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:04,254
Then you...

395
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:05,646
You leave me no choice.

396
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,988
I had Meredith Reed arrested.

397
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:16,467
Why?

398
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,077
Because her allegations
would be too damaging.

399
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,497
That doesn't make any sense.
You wouldn't arrest someone for making

400
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:25,141
false allegations.

401
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:30,713
Unless they aren't false.

402
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:35,898
You knew!

403
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:40,716
You knew the Russians
were behind my husband's death,

404
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,225
and you said nothing?

405
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:46,938
I am so sorry.

406
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,732
It was an impossible situation.

407
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,279
I was trying to protect you.

408
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:56,648
Protect me?

409
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:58,241
You betrayed me!

410
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:01,167
We are about to complete

411
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:04,492
the most important diplomatic action
in generations.

412
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:07,833
Your husband sacrificed his life
to preserve the treaty...

413
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:10,698
How dare you invoke my husband!

414
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,084
He never would have stood for this!

415
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:20,333
This treaty happened
because he trusted you.

416
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:23,933
And even though every fiber in my being
wanted to go home

417
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,978
and grieve,
I carried on because I trusted you.

418
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:28,611
But not anymore.

419
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,896
I will not make peace
with the people who murdered my husband.

420
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:34,068
Or with you.

421
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,560
There will be no agreement.

422
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,452
I will be entering a formal complaint
with the United Nations,

423
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,529
demanding that you release Ms. Reed,

424
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:48,416
and disclose whatever evidence
you've kept from me

425
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,634
and from the rest of the world!

426
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:01,121
In one hour,

427
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,064
you will stand beside me
in the council chamber,

428
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,685
and you will sign the treaty
your husband and I agreed to.

429
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,103
I won't!

430
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,271
You will!

431
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:13,399
If you don't,

432
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:15,141
my administration...

433
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:18,404
will disclose hard,
indisputable evidence

434
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,947
that agents
inside your intelligence service

435
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:23,367
attempted to detonate
a nuclear device

436
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,370
on our soil, which will give me

437
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,535
all the justification I need
to retaliate against the IRK

438
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,685
with the full force
of the American military.

439
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,152
It will be decades,
before your country recovers.

440
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,634
But it doesn't need to come to that.

441
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,884
All you have to do
is sign the agreement.

442
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,123
First they murder my husband,

443
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,841
and this woman who has lied to me
is threatening my country!

444
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:27,843
I don't see a way out of this,
Madam President.

445
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,010
We can tell the world
what these Russian bastards did,

446
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:36,522
and how President Taylor
protected them.

447
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,604
We can take our case
directly to The Hague.

448
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,122
There is no case.

449
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,336
No proof
to support any of these accusations.

450
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:46,059
More important,
there are aylor's threats to consider.

451
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:47,648
We cannot dismiss them.

452
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,962
Our military can protect us
from incursion.

453
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:53,387
And if necessary,
we can reactivate our nuclear program!

454
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,651
Giving your husband's enemies exactly
what they wanted in the first place.

455
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:03,610
In addition to providing her
with even more of an excuse

456
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:06,116
to launch a preemptive military strike
against us.

457
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:09,741
I don't care what President Taylor said,
she wouldn't dare.

458
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,930
Can you really take that chance?

459
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:36,328
Yuri Suvarov's delegation
will be arriving any moment.

460
00:32:37,273 --> 00:32:40,473
President Taylor is expecting you there
to greet him.

461
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:01,649
- What's going on?
- I spoke with Arlo.

462
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:03,689
He got a facial recognition
hit on Jack.

463
00:33:04,252 --> 00:33:05,107
Where?

464
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:07,772
Inside our perimeter.

465
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:09,197
He's here, Cole.

466
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:14,450
He's been careful to avoid
all the cameras, but Arlo found this.

467
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:18,275
The 22nd floor of the Hart Building
across the street from the UN.

468
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,456
The software
picked up his reflection.

469
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,166
How did he get into?

470
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,653
According to the logs,

471
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:26,912
the only one that entered the building
within the past 20 minutes was Pillar.

472
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:28,505
Jack must have taken him hostage.

473
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:32,051
The windows on the east side give him
a line of sight down onto the podium.

474
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:36,177
- I'm going to go find him.
- I'm going with you.

475
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:38,119
You can't.
You'll just cause a fight.

476
00:33:38,244 --> 00:33:40,768
- I'm the only one Jack will listen to.
- What if he doesn't?

477
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:44,938
20 minutes.

478
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,461
If you don't hear from me,
we'll follow through.

479
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:49,860
Sound the alarm about Jack
and secure Suvarov.

480
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,450
20 minutes.

481
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:56,450
Keep your comm open.
I want to know what's going on.

482
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:57,326
I can't.

483
00:33:57,525 --> 00:34:00,575
CTU is monitoring all frequencies.
It's too risky.

484
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:03,889
All right.

485
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,751
At least take this.

486
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:09,204
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

487
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,290
Where's O'Brian headed?

488
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:21,024
She's running
a last-minute perimeter sweep.

489
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,086
By herself?

490
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:24,425
Keep a uplink open
with Suvarov's security people.

491
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,250
Let me know
when it's up and running.

492
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:48,836
As long as I can remember,
every time I've had to talk to you,

493
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,007
it seems, for some reasons,

494
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,448
I've started out
by telling you how sorry I am.

495
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:58,137
I'm not going to do that to you now.

496
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:02,023
You'll hear a lot of stories
about what I've done today.

497
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:03,650
Some of them may even be true.

498
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:06,027
But no one, and I mean no one...

499
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:09,052
can tell you why I did what I did
except for me.

500
00:35:11,707 --> 00:35:13,575
And a lot of good people died today.

501
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,769
Not just President Hasn.

502
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:19,673
Operatives from CTU,
members of law enforcement agencies.

503
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,973
Who I was very close to.

504
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:50,844
President Suvarov's motorcade
has just rounded the corner.

505
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:53,901
Was Mrs. Hassan notified
of his arrival?

506
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,025
I believe so.

507
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,821
Yes or no, Tim? Which is it?
Is she coming or not?

508
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,334
Why wouldn't she be?

509
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:46,736
That we are all here together...

510
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,105
is a tribute to your persistence.

511
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,295
I am sorry for your loss.

512
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:58,175
I admired your husband very much.

513
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,801
We're wanted upstairs
for the press conference.

514
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:02,401
Yes, of course.

515
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,498
I know
this is very difficult for you.

516
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:15,473
There is nothing left
for either of us to say...

517
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:34,598
Chloe O'Brian, Director of CTU.

518
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:37,585
Master key and building schematics
you requested.

519
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:57,107
Good afternoon, fellow delegates
and ladies and gentlemen of the press.

520
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:59,912
The last 24 hours
have been the most...

521
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:02,828
difficult in this long
and challenging road

522
00:38:02,953 --> 00:38:05,490
that we've all traveled together
to reach this moment.

523
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:08,327
The eyes of the world
are looking to the leaders

524
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,038
standing here with me now,
ready to usher

525
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,606
in a new era of...

526
00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:15,375
transparency, honesty,

527
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:16,960
and trust.

528
00:38:23,372 --> 00:38:26,094
<i>They have each risen to this challenge
for the sake of world peace.</i>

529
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:30,019
<i>And the treaty
that they have created together</i>

530
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,444
<i>represents the culmination
of their courageous efforts.</i>

531
00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:42,156
Agent Burke?

532
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:46,031
I need you to assemble a ten-man squad
and deploy them to Sector C-7.

533
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,950
The Hart Building?
We've men on post.

534
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,494
Not enough if there's a threat
along that corridor.

535
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,901
Keep your men outside
until you hear otherwise.

536
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:10,782
What are you doing here?

537
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,658
Don't kill Suvarov.
There's another way.

538
00:40:12,783 --> 00:40:13,994
Who knows where I am?

539
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,163
- Please listen.
- Who else knows?

540
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,838
If I don't get you out now,
Cole's gonna send in

541
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,546
every agent we have.

542
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:29,587
Jack, they're going to kill you.

543
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:33,680
There's a order to shoot you on sight.
I couldn't let that happen.

544
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:35,891
You should let them come after me.

545
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:38,091
You're my friend.

546
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,770
I didn't have a choice.

547
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:41,926
Neither do I.

548
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,026
Don't fight it.

549
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:47,650
Don't fight it.

550
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:46,803
<i>Thank you.</i>

551
00:41:47,707 --> 00:41:49,477
<i>Mr. Secretary General,</i>

552
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:51,302
<i>distinguished delegates,</i>

553
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:52,815
<i>honored guests,</i>

554
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:55,765
<i>today the world
takes a tremendous step...</i>

555
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,847
You watching?

556
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,061
<i>I have a five-five-six rifle
pointed straight at your head.</i>

557
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,467
The bullet
travels 2,900 feet per second.

558
00:42:10,592 --> 00:42:12,195
If you move, you're a dead man.

559
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,865
Which means you need to do what I say.
Do you understand?

560
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,150
Do you understand?

561
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,623
I told you everything I know.

562
00:42:24,096 --> 00:42:26,146
And you thought I believed you?

563
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:32,098
<i>And aside from me,
Novakovich was the only one</i>

564
00:42:32,223 --> 00:42:34,973
<i>who knew that Suvarov
was calling the shots.</i>

565
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,100
<i>What do you want?</i>

566
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:44,811
Call President Suvarov
and have him meet you

567
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,063
where you are as soon as
the conference is over.

568
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,486
What do I tell him?

569
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:55,238
Try the truth for a change.

570
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:58,158
Tell him you've credible intelligence
about a threat to his life.
