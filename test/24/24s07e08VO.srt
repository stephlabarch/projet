1
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,657
The FBI believes

2
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:16,392
they've detected where the
next attack will take place.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,095
The chemical plant just
outside Kidron, Ohio.

4
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,796
<i>What's our time frame?</i>

5
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:22,198
The tank could rupture
in less than 15 minutes.

6
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,067
Right now our best chance to stop this

7
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:27,136
is by finding Dubaku and the CIP device.

8
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:28,271
400 psi.

9
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,040
How long before the tank ruptures?

10
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:32,475
<i>Seven minutes.</i>

11
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:33,977
We've got a problem.

12
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:35,578
I thought you killed Almeida and Bauer.

13
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,046
Damn it! How did they find us?!

14
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:38,214
I don't know!

15
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:39,415
 They're in the building.

16
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:40,716
Disengage the CIP module.

17
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,352
Begin the offload.

18
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:53,162
Go!

19
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,497
Jack, I've got the CIP device!

20
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,199
It's been destroyed.

21
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,501
The Matobos are safe. I'm
taking them to the van.

22
00:00:58,568 --> 00:00:59,835
Copy that.

23
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,804
You and Bill do a sweep.
See if you can find Dubaku.

24
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,009
We are not equipped to look for one man

25
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:07,076
in a city of millions.

26
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:08,944
We need additional resources.

27
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:10,446
The government? They can't be trusted.

28
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:11,614
We can't trust anybody.

29
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:12,948
That's why we're working on the outside.

30
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:15,751
President Taylor can be trusted.

31
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:19,122
Madame President, you
need to listen to me.

32
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:22,058
The people who rescued us, they
have acquired the CIP device.

33
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:23,426
It's being destroyed,

34
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:25,061
and your country's no longer
under immediate threat.

35
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:27,063
Who are these people?

36
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,931
I'll tell you everything in person,

37
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,833
but I must speak to you alone.

38
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,568
Please get Henry on the phone.

39
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:33,903
Henry's unreachable.

40
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>I've been trying to reach Agent Gedge,</i>

41
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,309
<i>and he hasn't picked up.</i>

42
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:42,978
<i>He said he was outside
Samantha Roth's apartment</i>

43
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:45,281
<i>waiting for the First Gentleman.</i>

44
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:48,051
<i>You're telling me my
husband's gone missing?</i>

45
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:51,954
<i>Gedge is dead.</i>

46
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:53,122
What happened?

47
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,457
Something went wrong.
Taylor killed Gedge,

48
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:55,791
I don't know how.

49
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:57,126
<i>Don't kill him.</i>

50
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,627
Bring him to me.

51
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:17,180
You're certain you weren't followed?

52
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:19,549
Yes. Come on. Help me get him inside.

53
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,296
We can confirm at this point

54
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:36,399
the tragedies that unfolded
in the skies over Washington

55
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:40,035
and in Kidron, Ohio, were
indeed acts of terrorism.

56
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:44,140
But I am here to assure
you that those responsible

57
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,210
are no longer a threat to this country.

58
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:50,012
Their attempts to stop
us from intervening

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,815
in the Sangalan genocide have failed.

60
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:57,720
We will not give in to terrorists.

61
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:00,156
A short time ago, I gave the order

62
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,790
for our troops to begin operations

63
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:04,059
that will liberate
the people of Sangala.

64
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:08,331
We are confident that the Juma
regime will collapse swiftly,

65
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:11,300
and that democracy will be restored

66
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:12,435
under the leadership

67
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:15,404
of Prime Minister Ule Motobo.

68
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:49,238
You, you, come.

69
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:58,714
Well done, Agent Vossler.

70
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,249
I've got to go now.

71
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,885
I've got a shift that starts at 4:00.

72
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:06,355
Then go. Your money will be
wired to the usual account.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,928
The room is soundproof, Mr. Taylor.

74
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:17,166
There's no point in screaming
or trying to call for help.

75
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:20,102
Elimu, remove Mr. Taylor's gag.

76
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:24,440
You son of a bitch.

77
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:27,042
You're behind my son's death.

78
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,645
He was poking his nose
where it did not belong.

79
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:31,480
You'll never get away with
this. You must know that.

80
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:33,216
Everyone in the city is
going be looking for me.

81
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:37,019
You should be concerned with
just one question, Mr. Taylor.

82
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:40,956
Does your wife love you enough

83
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:44,327
to call off the invasion of my country?

84
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:47,463
For your sake,

85
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:50,366
I hope the answer is yes.

86
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:55,238
Activate the scrambling device.

87
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,745
Our law enforcement agencies

88
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:05,281
will hunt down the people responsible

89
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,416
and bring them to justice.

90
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:11,487
I ask now that your thoughts and prayers

91
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:14,056
go to those who lost their lives today,

92
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:17,059
to their families and loved ones,

93
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:20,195
and to our troops who
are putting their lives

94
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:23,266
on the line in the name of freedom.

95
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,901
Thank you.

96
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:27,637
Good afternoon.

97
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,242
Motobo's arrived.

98
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,544
He and the others have
been brought in secretly

99
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:37,280
through the underground entrance

100
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:40,283
by agents I personally know and trust.

101
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,151
Motobo told me the
people he's bringing in

102
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,186
are responsible for saving his life

103
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:46,289
and recovering the CIP device.

104
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:47,623
Who are they?

105
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,725
Bill Buchanan, whom I believe you met

106
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,627
when he headed up CTU L.A.,

107
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:55,197
FBI agent named Renee Walker

108
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:58,367
and Jack Bauer.

109
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:01,136
Bauer...

110
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:03,539
He was one of Motobo's kidnappers.

111
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:04,807
Doesn't make sense.

112
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:07,142
I know.

113
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,313
Motobo asked me to listen
to what they have to say,

114
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,683
and I'm willing to do so.

115
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,184
Send them in.

116
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:19,888
The president's ready.

117
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,461
Ule.

118
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,663
I can't tell you

119
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:30,265
how thankful we are that
you and Alama are safe.

120
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:33,636
Thank you. She's with
Mr. Buchanan's people now,

121
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,204
recovering.

122
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,271
That you were subjected

123
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,973
to such an ordeal

124
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,743
on our soil is a source
of shame both to me

125
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:42,712
personally and to my country.

126
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:43,912
Madame President,

127
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,515
my chief concern is
for Sangala, not myself.

128
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,451
May I ask what your timetable is

129
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:49,918
for the invasion?

130
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,687
I've issued the order

131
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,756
to our military to proceed.

132
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,791
I thank you with all my heart.

133
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:58,126
You're doing my people a great service,

134
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:00,796
much as these people have
done for your country.

135
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:03,499
Now forgive me, Prime Minister,

136
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,868
but I'm finding that hard to believe.

137
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,371
I assure you, none of
this is as it seems.

138
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:10,373
But they're here to explain themselves.

139
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,376
Now, if you'll excuse
me, Madame President,

140
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:14,777
I must meet with my people

141
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,144
to discuss post-invasion plans.

142
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:17,880
Of course.

143
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,394
I want an explanation and I want it now.

144
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,396
What the hell is going on?!

145
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:35,531
Madame President,

146
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,932
six weeks ago, Bill Buchanan discovered

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,367
that key members of your government

148
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:39,702
were working with General Juma

149
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,604
and Colonel Dubaku in an effort

150
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,238
to undermine this
nation's foreign policy...

151
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:47,175
<i>your foreign policy
with regards to Sangala.</i>

152
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:51,179
You realize that that is
an outrageous accusation?

153
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:54,650
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:56,051
Unfortunately, it's the truth.

155
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,920
It explains why during this crisis,

156
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,289
every effort you made
to stop Dubaku failed.

157
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:05,260
Bill, why didn't you come to me?

158
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:07,996
I didn't know who I could trust
or if you'd even believe me.

159
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:10,198
So I formed

160
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:13,436
a small group to locate
and neutralize Dubaku.

161
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:14,703
Tony Almeida and ultimately, Jack,

162
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:15,871
joined me.

163
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:17,973
Tony Almeida was the one
who put the CIP device

164
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,174
into Dubaku's hands

165
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:20,443
in the first place.

166
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,846
Using the CIP device
as bait was necessary

167
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:25,614
to the undercover operation.

168
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:27,349
We had to follow it back to Dubaku.

169
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,350
A lot of people

170
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:31,587
died on those planes, never mind what

171
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:34,389
could have happened at the
chemical plant in Kidron!

172
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,625
Madame President, if I may, I was part

173
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:39,361
of the FBI task force assigned
to recover the CIP device,

174
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,464
and I can personally vouch
for what they're telling you.

175
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:43,432
The loss of life was tragic, yes,

176
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,900
but in my opinion,

177
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,302
everything these men have done
saved the lives of thousands.

178
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:53,542
If I choose to believe
everything you're telling me,

179
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,011
where would you go from here?

180
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,212
Dubaku is the only person

181
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,881
with the names of the
people who betrayed you

182
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:59,949
within your government.

183
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,183
It's imperative that we find him.

184
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,418
We would have to work under the radar.

185
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,887
Any word of an investigation,

186
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,188
people would start running for cover.

187
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,123
You're saying we can't even involve

188
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,058
the FBI and Homeland?

189
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,193
Yes, sir, that's correct.

190
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,262
Madame President,

191
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,598
Tim Woods is on the phone.

192
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:16,699
He says it's urgent.

193
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:17,867
Put him through.

194
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,334
Put him through.

195
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:20,769
Have a seat.

196
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,039
Yes?

197
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:25,608
Madame President, I'm
sorry to interrupt.

198
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,810
There's a call for you from Ike Dubaku.

199
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:30,212
Voice I.D. confirms that. He
says it's about your husband.

200
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,581
My husband?

201
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,684
Yes, ma'am. I'll connect you.

202
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,589
This is President Taylor.

203
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:42,892
I'll come straight to the
point, Madame President.

204
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,426
I have your husband.

205
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,762
Let me demonstrate.

206
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,263
Say something.

207
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:50,799
Allison...

208
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,669
Henry, are you all right?

209
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,137
I'm fine.

210
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:56,772
I'm sorry about this.

211
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,307
For God sake, don't let them use me

212
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,976
to influence you in any way.

213
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,413
Our demands are as follows:

214
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,048
You will have your forces

215
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,316
withdrawn from around
my country, Sangala,

216
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:09,885
immediately and permanently.

217
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:13,756
Also, Motobo must be delivered to my men

218
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,724
who will be stationed at the east lot

219
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,560
of the Stanswick Power Plant.

220
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:20,429
If he's not there by 4:00,

221
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,032
or if anybody attempts
to follow or impede my men

222
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:24,533
when they leave the plant,

223
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,269
your husband will die a
slow and certain death.

224
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,872
You wouldn't dare!

225
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,239
Cut off his finger.

226
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,697
Stop it!

227
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:57,399
Stop it!

228
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:02,504
Meet my demands

229
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:05,440
or I will send him back
to you one piece at a time.

230
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:09,578
Do you understand, Madame President?

231
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:10,779
Yes,

232
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:11,947
I understand.

233
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,015
Any attempt

234
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,349
to find your husband

235
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,051
will be known to me very quickly,

236
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,687
and I will kill him immediately.

237
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,226
Madame President, I just heard back

238
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:26,829
from the team I sent to
Henry's last-known location.

239
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,163
They found Samantha Roth's

240
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,432
and Secret Service Agent Gedge's bodies.

241
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,600
Oh, God!

242
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,769
Gedge had possession
of a paralytic drug.

243
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:36,505
That and other evidence on
scene suggests he was complicit

244
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:39,108
in Henry's abduction,
which, of course, confirms

245
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:42,077
the corruption you just told us about.

246
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:45,948
Madame President, time is tight.

247
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:48,416
We need to decide how to respond.

248
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:50,485
I don't think anyone would blame you

249
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:54,023
for holding back, at least temporarily,

250
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,025
the invasion of Sangala.

251
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,762
How many people died on those planes?

252
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,597
How many?!

253
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,266
About 300, ma'am.

254
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:09,004
All because I refused to
change course in Sangala.

255
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:21,316
How can I ask the American
people to make sacrifices

256
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:24,452
that I'm not willing to make myself?

257
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:32,294
I can't give in.

258
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:34,629
I can't.

259
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:37,900
Madame President...

260
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,902
we can still try and find your husband

261
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:41,403
before the 4:00 deadline.

262
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,707
Dubaku has specifically forbidden that.

263
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:47,409
And according to you,
I can't trust any of my

264
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,577
law enforcement agencies.

265
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,812
You can trust me.

266
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,648
Right now everyone believes
that Agent Walker is dead,

267
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:55,517
and I have no status at all.

268
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:56,919
Which means that Dubaku's spies

269
00:12:56,986 --> 00:13:00,522
cannot track us because
officially, we don't exist.

270
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,457
You resigned from government service,

271
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:06,361
and the Senate regards you as
having been a renegade agent.

272
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:12,835
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

273
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:17,539
With all due respect,
Madame President, ask around.

274
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:26,782
What could you even do
on such short notice?

275
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,683
I couldn't make you any promises,

276
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,620
but we will do everything
possible to save your husband.

277
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,455
Right now, we need you to go along

278
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:37,392
with Dubaku's demands.
Help buy us some time.

279
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:41,730
Madame President, you
don't have another choice.

280
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,203
All right.

281
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,539
All right.

282
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:54,977
Find him, please?

283
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,812
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,947
We're gonna need a secure hard line.

285
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:15,563
You may use this room if you need to.

286
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,199
I'll have you escorted back out through

287
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,667
the underground entrance
when you're ready.

288
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,302
I'm gonna need a copy of the president

289
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,736
and the First Gentleman's
Secret Service details.

290
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,071
I'll have them brought to you.

291
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,572
Thank you.

292
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,075
Okay, we'll start off with Agent Gedge.

293
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:28,777
We need access to his phone records.

294
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:31,013
I want to know who he's been
talking to over the last few hours.

295
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,981
Obviously, we can't use any of

296
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,416
the president's security people.

297
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:37,920
Thank you.

298
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,024
Phone logs are highly classified,

299
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,092
especially for agents
assigned to the First Family.

300
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,593
Can Chloe O'Brian get access?

301
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:46,661
It'll be faster if we can get someone

302
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:47,662
who's already got clearance.

303
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,730
Larry Moss.

304
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:50,532
He doesn't strike me

305
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,534
as someone who's willing
to work outside the system.

306
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,537
That's true, but I think I can
persuade him to do what we need.

307
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,771
You really trust him?

308
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,042
Yes. We know each other pretty well.

309
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:04,046
Fine. Try him. We don't have much time.

310
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,590
Agent Moss.

311
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:18,126
Larry, it's Renee. I'm alive,

312
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,628
but you can't let anyone
know. Do you understand me?

313
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,965
Oh, my God.

314
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:31,439
Renee? What... Where are
you? Are you all right?

315
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:33,275
I'm-I'm fine. I'll explain later,

316
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:35,177
but right now we need your help.

317
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:36,378
Who's, who's "we"?

318
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,046
Myself and Jack Bauer.

319
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,414
What?!

320
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,284
He's on our side,
Larry, just like he said.

321
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,552
Everything that he did, he
did to preserve his cover.

322
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,922
Renee, this whole time I've
been thinking you were dead.

323
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,257
Why didn't you tell me?

324
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,591
The Bureau is compromised.

325
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,127
Larry, just like he said,
and on one there can know

326
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,863
about this operation. It has
to stay completely off book.

327
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:00,402
What operation?

328
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,504
Jack and I are at the White House.

329
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,507
The First Gentleman has
been kidnapped by Ike Dubaku.

330
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:08,010
I don't, I don't know
anything about that.

331
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:10,745
It's true. The president's
asked Jack and me to find him.

332
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:12,147
Very few people know about this,

333
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:14,182
and that's the way that it has to stay.

334
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,885
If we don't find him by
4:00 p.m., he'll be killed.

335
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:23,125
Larry... if you've ever trusted me,

336
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:26,828
trust me now, please, and help me.

337
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:29,131
What do you want me to do?

338
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,099
Looks like the First
Gentleman's Secret Service agent

339
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,468
was involved in all of
this... Brian Gedge; he's dead.

340
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:34,970
You need to check his phone logs

341
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:36,638
and get all the information you can

342
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,308
about who he's been in
contact with recently.

343
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:45,414
I need to see you to
make sure this is real,

344
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,681
that you're not under duress.

345
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:48,850
No, there's no time for that.

346
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:50,552
That's not negotiable.
You want my help, we meet.

347
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:53,155
The Capitol Reflecting Pool,
as soon as you can get there.

348
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,222
Okay, fine.

349
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,393
He'll help us, I think,
but we need to go.

350
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,111
President Taylor emphasized

351
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:15,479
the terrorists are no longer a threat

352
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,715
and says the invasion will begin.

353
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:18,983
She also says

354
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,552
former Prime Minister Ule
Motobo will be reinstated

355
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,655
to work towards building a
new democratic government.

356
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:24,656
I don't get it.

357
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:25,690
What?

358
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:27,091
The president's talking as if

359
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,593
the CIP device and Motobo
have been recovered,

360
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,896
but how could that have happened
without us knowing about it?

361
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:33,831
Well, it just means
whatever agency's responsible

362
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:34,832
hasn't let us know.

363
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,833
What other agency?

364
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:36,868
We're being kept out of the loop,

365
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:37,935
and I don't like it.

366
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,540
So am I seeing you later?

367
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:45,710
I don't know. I've got
some things to figure out.

368
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:46,878
What does that mean?

369
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,612
It means I have to
get home at some point.

370
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,347
I haven't seen Christina in a week.

371
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:54,018
All right.

372
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:55,687
Sean, are you all right?

373
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:58,022
I'm fine.

374
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,892
I'm sensing a little distance.

375
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,626
I just have to get back to work.

376
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,401
Excuse me.

377
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:13,404
Could you be a little
less obvious, do you think?

378
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,672
What are you talking about?

379
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Give me a break.

380
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,341
Just hold up a sign that says,

381
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,210
"Hey, world, we're sleeping together."

382
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:20,377
Are you stupid?

383
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:22,847
I know it's stupid and wrong,

384
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,348
and I'm gonna end it.

385
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,884
Yeah, you'd better, fast,
before Larry notices.

386
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:28,352
Where is Larry?

387
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,321
I don't know. That's not the point.

388
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,356
The point is, if he
finds out about this,

389
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:34,692
he's gonna transfer your
ass to Juneau so fast,

390
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,493
your head will spin.

391
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,250
Larry.

392
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:05,522
Oh, my God.

393
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,864
I thought I'd never see you again.

394
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:20,304
Were you able to access
Agent Gedge's phone records?

395
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:23,875
Yeah.

396
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:25,342
Yeah,

397
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,645
over the last three hours,
Gedge spoke repeatedly

398
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,546
to another Secret Service
agent named Edward Vossler.

399
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:32,850
I checked out Vossler's
personnel records.

400
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,419
Before he was a Secret Service
agent, he was Special Forces,

401
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,554
and for two years, served in Sangala.

402
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:40,658
So we can assume Vossler's
working for Dubaku.

403
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,726
Did you bring any of his files with you?

404
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,128
Yeah.

405
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,201
Does Vossler have a family?

406
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,503
Why do you need to know that?

407
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,038
Does he have a family?

408
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:56,307
He's been married for
five years to a paralegal.

409
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:58,843
They have an
11-month-old baby boy.

410
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:00,644
She left her job to
stay home with the kid.

411
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:01,913
Okay, we're gonna need to split up.

412
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,547
I need you to help me track Vossler.

413
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:06,818
I need you to go to his home
and hope his family is there.

414
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:08,452
Vossler was Special Forces.

415
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,354
There's no way we're gonna break
him in the time that we've got.

416
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,523
The only way to get him
to cooperate is to make him

417
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,491
think we're gonna hurt his
family, his wife and his kid.

418
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,627
No, absolutely not. Renee?

419
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:17,929
That's stepping over the line, Jack.

420
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:19,697
You stepped over the line

421
00:20:19,764 --> 00:20:20,898
the second you interrogated Tanner.

422
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,399
Tanner's a murderer.

423
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,735
As far as we know, Vossler's
wife is completely innocent,

424
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:25,903
let alone a small child.

425
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:27,638
When are you people gonna stop thinking

426
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:28,940
everyone else is following your rules?!

427
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:30,407
They're not!

428
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,109
Dubaku is gonna kill Henry Taylor

429
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:33,444
within the next 45 minutes

430
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:35,412
unless we find him.

431
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,747
You've got one of two choices:

432
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:38,816
Now you can either phone the
president and explain to her

433
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,084
that your conscience won't allow you

434
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,785
to do what is necessary to save him,

435
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:45,589
or you can simply do what is necessary.

436
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:47,959
Pick one!

437
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:53,231
Renee?

438
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,398
Larry!

439
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:00,838
Renee?

440
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,473
I'm gonna need your vehicle.

441
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,041
Start tracking Vossler
through his cell phone.

442
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,809
Utilize his Secret
Service deployment grid.

443
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:07,644
Look at yourself.

444
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:11,782
You've lost everyone and
everything you ever had

445
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,951
by doing what you think is necessary.

446
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,453
I won't let you do it to her, Bauer.

447
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:19,924
Renee will not end up like you.

448
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:27,265
Are you gonna give me your keys or not?

449
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,747
Jack.

450
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:44,982
Jack!

451
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,887
The rules are what make us better.

452
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:52,189
Not today.

453
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:06,070
Even those who oppose
the plan to invade Sangala

454
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:09,873
can't deny the atrocities
committed by that regime.

455
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:12,043
I slowed down Taylor's bleeding,

456
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,677
but I can't get it to stop completely.

457
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:14,946
Tourniquet is as tight as possible?

458
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,280
Yes.

459
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:17,281
Then cauterize the wound.

460
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,682
Mikali has a blowtorch.

461
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,783
You risk Taylor going into shock.

462
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:21,518
Just put something in his mouth.

463
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,421
I don't want him biting his
tongue off with the pain.

464
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,457
Hey, what are you doing at home, huh?

465
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:27,858
I thought you'd be at work.

466
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:31,028
I was. Rosa called me at the diner.

467
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:33,064
She was having one of her episodes.

468
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:35,232
You know your sister.
She's just manipulating you.

469
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,401
You don't have to go to
her every time she calls.

470
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,570
I'm all she has, Samuel. Be kind.

471
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,639
You know, you're kind
enough for both of us.

472
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:44,108
I just wanted to make sure

473
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,876
that you were still
coming to dinner tonight.

474
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:49,947
Um, look, I'm really sorry, but I can't.

475
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:51,648
I'm looking at a stack
of shipping manifests.

476
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:54,852
Oh, no! Isn't there some way?

477
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,854
We could do it as late as you want.

478
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,390
I really wish I could.

479
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,824
I'm sorry, Marika.

480
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:02,994
Uh, listen, baby,

481
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:04,828
I'll make it up to you, okay?

482
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:06,864
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make extra

483
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:08,565
just in case you change your mind.

484
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:09,933
You're too good to me.

485
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,435
You're right.

486
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:19,010
I have to get back to the diner, Rosa.

487
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:20,011
Are you gonna be okay?

488
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:21,912
Who was that on the phone?

489
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,082
It was him, wasn't it?

490
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,250
All right, stop.

491
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,685
I know you don't approve

492
00:23:28,753 --> 00:23:30,587
of Samuel, but I love him.

493
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,390
Oh. You love him?

494
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:34,291
Why?

495
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,894
Because he spends money on you?

496
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:38,695
Because he pays our rent?

497
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:40,131
You've only known him

498
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:41,165
four months.

499
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,400
What difference does that make?

500
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,268
You don't know anything about him.

501
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,238
What if he's not the
importer he says he is?

502
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:49,673
Or that he's in this country illegally?

503
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:50,841
Not this again.

504
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,410
I'm just trying to protect you, Marika.

505
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:54,545
I don't need your protection.

506
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:55,646
Yes, you do.

507
00:23:56,614 --> 00:23:59,250
This man isn't...

508
00:23:59,317 --> 00:24:01,452
Isn't what?

509
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:06,690
Nothing.

510
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:08,992
Forget it.

511
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,994
I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.

512
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:12,996
I'll be home after my shift.

513
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:32,049
We can appear to comply with
the first part of Dubaku's demand

514
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,617
by pulling the fleet back.

515
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:36,753
Then we simply launch the
invasion from farther out at sea.

516
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:39,323
Now, the second part of his
demand is more complicated.

517
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:41,692
If we were really turning Matobo over,

518
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,461
we'd be putting him in
a car right about now.

519
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:45,729
That's out of the
question. We need him safe.

520
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:49,467
Agreed. But we can send
a car with a look-alike.

521
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:51,902
If we handle it right, Dubaku
won't be aware of the deception

522
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,170
until the last minute.

523
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:54,805
By then, hopefully,
we'll have found Henry.

524
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:58,675
Madame President, do we have
your authorization to proceed?

525
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,678
Yes.

526
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:10,621
This is Bauer.

527
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:12,623
Okay, I've got Vossler.
He's on the Beltway

528
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,594
near Bethesda, moving south,
about seven miles from you.

529
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:18,929
Copy that. I'm on my
way. Where's he headed?

530
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:20,764
According to the Secret Service log,

531
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:22,399
his shift starts at 4:00 p.m.

532
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,868
He's meeting a foreign
dignitary's plane at Andrews.

533
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:26,637
Jack, I don't have to tell you...

534
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:28,139
once he's through that
gate and onto that base,

535
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:29,640
you're not going to
be able to touch him.

536
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:31,708
Okay, he's going to have
to double back on the 337

537
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:33,344
if he wants to get
through that main gate.

538
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:35,379
I should be able to make up
time by taking Connecticut.

539
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,281
Just keep sight of him.

540
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:40,017
Have you heard from Renee?

541
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:42,386
Do we know if she's arrived
at Vossler's house yet?

542
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,255
No. But she knows how
to get in touch with us

543
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:45,489
if she's in trouble.

544
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,444
Coming.

545
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:11,549
Can I help you?

546
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:14,885
Who are you?

547
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:17,154
Shut up. Do what I tell
you, and there's a chance

548
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,689
you'll live through this.

549
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,884
Don't move! He's scared.

550
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:43,220
Stay where you are or I will
shoot you where you stand.

551
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:45,956
You're going to kill me for
trying to comfort my baby?

552
00:26:46,024 --> 00:26:48,459
Sit down.

553
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:49,927
What kind of a person are you?

554
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:51,062
Doing this to us.

555
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:54,465
You should ask your husband that.

556
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:56,800
What are you talking about?

557
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:00,104
Edward is a good man.

558
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,706
Maybe you don't know him quite
as well as you think you do.

559
00:27:02,774 --> 00:27:04,775
I know he would never point
a gun near a child. Shut up!

560
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:11,882
Put the cuff around your wrist.

561
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,050
Don't do this.

562
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:14,051
Now!

563
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:27,064
Okay, where is he now?

564
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:28,899
He just got off the Beltway.

565
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,334
He's stopped in traffic.

566
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:32,136
Okay, I'm coming up on the intersection

567
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:34,238
of Allenford and Auth. I
should be there in 30 seconds.

568
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:35,606
Just let me know if he moves.

569
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:42,846
He's moving.

570
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:43,847
Damn it!

571
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:45,015
What's the next street north?

572
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,283
Baxter Drive.

573
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:47,751
But, Jack, it's a one-way street.

574
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,019
Copy that.

575
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:56,327
He made the light at Allenford.

576
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:01,765
I'm on Baxter.

577
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,134
He's 15 seconds away, Jack.

578
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:11,375
Ten seconds.

579
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:16,247
Five seconds.

580
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:19,316
I got him.

581
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,662
Let me see your hands!

582
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:32,863
Now!

583
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,734
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

584
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:41,738
Move. Move!

585
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,248
Where is he?

586
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:54,017
Where is Henry Taylor? I don't
know what you're talking about.

587
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:55,085
Where is he?

588
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:57,954
Fine,

589
00:28:58,022 --> 00:28:59,523
we'll do this your way.

590
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:06,597
Yes.

591
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:07,665
I've got Vossler. You got his wife?

592
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:10,867
And his child. You ready?

593
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,503
Yes.

594
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:14,037
Put your phone on speaker.

595
00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:16,640
Talk to your wife.

596
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,710
You son of a bitch... Talk to your wife!

597
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:22,713
Carol, ar-are you all right?

598
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,016
There's a woman with a gun.
She's threatening to kill me.

599
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:27,451
Why is Conner crying?

600
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,752
Oh, my God, Edward.

601
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,088
What's happening? Who are these people?

602
00:29:31,155 --> 00:29:34,425
You are running out of time.

603
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:36,126
I didn't want to have to do this.

604
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:39,029
No, you wouldn't...

605
00:29:39,097 --> 00:29:43,434
What's happening? I don't
know. She's got Conner.

606
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,936
Oh, my God, she's doing
something to Conner!

607
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:48,038
Let go of my baby!

608
00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:50,274
He's just a baby! Please!

609
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:53,644
What the hell are you doing? You can
stop this. Just tell me where he is.

610
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:57,314
For God's sake, Edward, tell
them what they want to know!

611
00:29:57,382 --> 00:30:00,451
Damn it! All right, all
right, I'll tell you!

612
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:04,321
Stand down. I'll get back to you.

613
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:13,964
Your baby's fine.

614
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:20,571
You're a monster!

615
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:24,508
Where is he?!

616
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,510
You tell me now, or the situation

617
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:27,978
for your family goes from bad to worse.

618
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:29,480
Where is he?

619
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:32,449
How do I know you're just
not going to kill them anyway?

620
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:33,651
You don't.

621
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,054
Fine.

622
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:41,625
There's a greengrocer,
12451 Arlington Avenue.

623
00:30:41,693 --> 00:30:43,226
They're holding him in the basement.

624
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:44,295
Access.

625
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:45,429
There's a staircase in the back,

626
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:46,530
but it's always locked.

627
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:47,898
Is Dubaku with him? He was.

628
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,232
How many guns are guarding him?

629
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:50,668
At least four. Get out of here!

630
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:40,183
Get away from the car!

631
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:42,619
Walk away... now!

632
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:46,390
Damn it.

633
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:50,561
Stop!

634
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:52,363
Get out of the car now!

635
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,997
Move! Move!

636
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:14,580
The goal is to make it look like
we're going to hand Matobo over

637
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,649
for as long as is reasonably possible.

638
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:19,585
When you get to the rendezvous point,

639
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:21,054
keep your distance from Dubaku's men.

640
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:22,622
Let them see you in the backseat,

641
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,357
but do not get out of the car.

642
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:27,227
Don't let them get any closer
than you feel comfortable with.

643
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:29,930
As soon as you start to feel
that the risk is unacceptable,

644
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,031
get the hell out.

645
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,866
That's straight from the president.

646
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,667
Clear? Clear.

647
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,469
Good luck.

648
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:44,077
Jack?

649
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:45,312
I got an address

650
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:47,914
for Henry Taylor.
12451 Arlington Avenue.

651
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,116
It's a storefront. He's
being held in the basement.

652
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:52,518
If you get there before I
do, I want you to stand down.

653
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:54,120
Dubaku's got at least four gunmen there.

654
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:55,688
All right. Meanwhile,
I'm going to call Bill,

655
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:56,789
pull him up to speed.

656
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,691
I want you to do the
same thing with Larry.

657
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,960
And what about Vossler? He's dead.

658
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:02,996
He attacked me. I didn't have a choice.

659
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,031
Are you okay?

660
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,839
No, I don't think I am.

661
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,941
What do you mean? What's wrong?

662
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,613
Agent Walker, are you still there?

663
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:23,416
I'm not...

664
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,518
Listen to me.

665
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,288
We could not have gotten
this far if it wasn't for you.

666
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:30,023
Okay?

667
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,793
No one would blame you if this was
just too much for you to handle.

668
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:37,097
Maybe you should get out.

669
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,665
Maybe I will.

670
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:42,102
Yeah.

671
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:44,504
Tomorrow.

672
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,918
Agent Masden and I are on our way.

673
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:59,386
We'll be tracking you via satellite.

674
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,421
Check in with me when you're
approaching the power plant.

675
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:02,488
Yes, sir.

676
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:04,690
How much time do you
think this will buy us?

677
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:07,727
Until Dubaku realizes
Matobo's not in the limo.

678
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,429
Ten minutes, maybe 15.

679
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:11,664
That's 15 minutes more than we had.

680
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:14,700
Madame President, I just got
off the phone with Jack Bauer.

681
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:17,037
He and Agent Walker think they
have a location on your husband.

682
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:18,471
Where?

683
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,006
Arlington Avenue.
They're on their way now.

684
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:21,975
How long will it take them?

685
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,476
Ten, 15 minutes.

686
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:25,178
Thank you.

687
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,217
This just came over from Homeland.

688
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:32,452
Like you said...

689
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,686
we're being kept out of the loop.

690
00:34:33,754 --> 00:34:36,022
Thanks.

691
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,130
Did you see this?

692
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,900
Homeland's preparing to
lower the threat level

693
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,035
at the president's request.

694
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:50,170
Yeah, I saw the flash.

695
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:51,838
Don't you think that's odd,

696
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:54,074
considering we don't know anything
about the CIP device being recovered?

697
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,742
Yeah. I'll talk to Homeland.

698
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,478
All I'm saying is... I get the feeling

699
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:00,646
like there's something going
on behind our back here.

700
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:02,515
Like I said, I'll talk to them.

701
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,856
Excuse me. Yeah, sure.

702
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:14,660
Where are you?

703
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,929
On my way to where we think
Henry Taylor's being held.

704
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:20,000
So you got Vossler to talk.

705
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:23,003
It gave us our only chance to
rescue the president's husband.

706
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,004
What's the address?

707
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:25,438
I'll send a SWAT team to meet you.

708
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:26,572
You know you can't do that.

709
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,673
The Bureau's compromised.

710
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:29,976
It will jeopardize any
attempt that we make.

711
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,212
But there is something
else I need you to do.

712
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:33,779
Okay, what's that?

713
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,115
Keep an incident quiet

714
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:37,283
until what Jack and
I are doing goes down.

715
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,284
What incident?

716
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:39,785
Vossler's dead.

717
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:41,854
Jack killed him at the
hotel on 18th and Riggin.

718
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:42,922
It was self-defense.

719
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,557
Is that what he told you?

720
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,560
Larry... Damn it, Renee, what the
hell are you doing with this guy?

721
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:49,795
We're supposed to bring
suspects in, not murder them.

722
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:51,131
Larry, please...

723
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:53,766
And until we know who
Dubaku's source is there,

724
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:56,336
you've got to handle this
outside of the Bureau, okay?

725
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:03,609
There's a guy at D.C.
Metro I know I can trust.

726
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:05,378
I'll have him deal with Vossler.

727
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,447
Thank you, Larry.

728
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:12,952
I understand. I will let him know.

729
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,189
According to our sources,
a vehicle containing Matobo

730
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,590
just left the White House. Good.

731
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,325
What is the state of the
American invasion forces?

732
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,593
The fleet is withdrawing

733
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:22,529
from Sangalan territorial waters,

734
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,297
and has set steam for the 23rd Meridian.

735
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:25,965
Excellent.

736
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,067
Hello.

737
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:28,634
It's Rosa.

738
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:31,471
Rosa, if you're looking for
Marika, she's not with me.

739
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,772
I'm looking for you, Samuel.

740
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,141
Or whatever your real name is.

741
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:37,977
What are you talking about?

742
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:40,180
My sister may be naive, but I'm not.

743
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:43,916
I checked with someone I
know at Immigration Services,

744
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:47,420
and no one named Samuel
Aboa emigrated from Sangala

745
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,989
in the last year, or
in the last 15 years.

746
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:52,125
Well, they've obviously made a mistake.

747
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:53,593
You're making a mistake.

748
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,429
Now I don't know who you
really are, and I don't care.

749
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:58,498
I just want you out of my sister's life.

750
00:36:58,566 --> 00:36:59,799
Does Marika know about this?

751
00:36:59,866 --> 00:37:02,001
No, not yet.

752
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:03,703
And I'm willing to keep it that way.

753
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,638
So you've not reported me to anyone?

754
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:08,908
No. I don't want Marika to
know anything about this.

755
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:11,544
What do you want?

756
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:13,045
Break up with her,

757
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:15,648
and this stays between us.

758
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:16,983
You just end it tonight,

759
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,685
and we won't have a problem.

760
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:31,264
I have to take care of a little problem.

761
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,865
Call me when we have Matobo.

762
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:05,405
Yeah.

763
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,040
The vehicle that's supposed
to be delivering Matobo

764
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:09,142
is arriving at the power
plant. If we delay any longer,

765
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,045
Dubaku is going to get
suspicious. What's your status?

766
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:14,514
I'm almosthere. How much time
can you buy us? I dot know, Jack.

767
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:17,450
Okay, Agent Walker and I will
move in as soon as I get there.

768
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:18,518
I'll keep you posted.

769
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,320
All right, good luck.

770
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:21,788
This is Agent Smith.

771
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:23,824
We've got a visual on
Dubaku's men. Understood.

772
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:25,192
We have it on satellite.

773
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:50,183
Bring him to us.

774
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:01,161
They've ordered us
to get out of the car.

775
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:04,397
Now one of them is making
a call. Hang tight, Agent.

776
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,166
Their car arrived,

777
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:08,534
but nothing is happening. What
do you mean nothing is happening?

778
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:10,570
We ordered them to
hand Matobo over to us

779
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:12,705
but no one's getting out of the vehicle.

780
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:15,041
The Americans have been playing us.

781
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:16,243
Destroy their vehicle.

782
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,777
Yes, sir.

783
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:21,948
That's long enough. Get them
the hell out of there. Retreat.

784
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:24,417
Get out now. Roger that.

785
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,975
You ready? Yes.

786
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:50,343
Let's go.

787
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:59,386
Get out from behind
the counter. Now! Move!

788
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:10,797
Okay, I want you to unlock that door.

789
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:13,900
And I want you to ask those
men what they want to eat.

790
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:15,402
You do one thing I don't like,

791
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:17,938
and I will blow your head
off, you understand me?

792
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:19,172
Open the door.

793
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,154
Want anything to eat?

794
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:37,457
No. Some cold beers. Okay.

795
00:41:40,754 --> 00:41:41,921
Yes.

796
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,257
Kill Henry Taylor.

797
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:46,359
Then we have nothing to
hold over their heads.

798
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:48,361
We don't have anything now.

799
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:50,397
The president was
willing to let him die.

800
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:51,498
We are done here.

801
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:52,865
Kill Taylor,

802
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,401
and have your men pack everything up.

803
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:55,568
Understood.

804
00:42:40,847 --> 00:42:42,782
Oh, my God.

805
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:45,085
Sir... sir...

806
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:47,487
We're going to get you help.

807
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:49,222
Just stay with me.

808
00:42:51,858 --> 00:42:53,259
Get an ambulance!
