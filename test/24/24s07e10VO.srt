******

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,800
madam president, we have your husband, but
he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,460
Is my husband going to be okay?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,179
We're not going to know anything
until the doctors see hiM.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,369
Since your husband was the only
leverage that dubaku had left,

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,509
it's safe to say that he's
trying to leave the country now.

10
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:31,100
Whatever we're going to do to find
him, we're going to have to do it fast.

11
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:34,395
Whatever it takes, I want
that son of a bitch found!

12
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:38,107
Have someone find my daughter,
olivia, and bring her to me.

13
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:42,253
What is it that's so important for my mother to
steal me away while I'm trying to do business?

14
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,482
It's your father.
He's been shot.

15
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:46,780
My, god, I...

16
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:49,772
do you think I'm a fool,
mr. Burnett?

17
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:52,281
If anything should happen to
me on my way out of the country,

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,281
a data file with all the names and
bank transactions of all those involved

19
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,693
will be sent to the
justice department.

20
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,661
You told me that once dubaku served
his purpose, you'd take him out.

21
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,160
Why are we still helping him?

22
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:07,550
He's threatening to expose us using a database he's
kept with names and accounts of everyone involved.

23
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,382
Including mine?

24
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:11,791
We don't know where the file is, so
you just better pray that he gets away.

25
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,242
I'm begging you, marika...

26
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:16,072
- fbi! Don't move!
- Get on your knees! Now!

27
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:18,322
- Where is dubaku?
- Who?

28
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:20,613
Don't play games with me!
Ike dubaku!

29
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:21,693
You know this man?

30
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:23,270
She was going to meet him.

31
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:26,140
When the car arrives, we would
like you to go with the driver,

32
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:28,101
so that we could follow
you back to dubaku.

33
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,161
You want her to go
to him and face him?

34
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:33,302
It's the only chance we have of finding
him before he disappears forever.

35
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,433
I'll do it.

36
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:36,130
You keep her safe, you hear me?

37
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:36,983
We will.

38
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:39,323
You're less than a mile
behind the target car.

39
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,301
I got metro pds trying to
build a roadblock around us.

40
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,322
We can't afford to
lose them, jack!

41
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,641
I gave this woman my
word we'd protect her.

42
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,660
get out of the car, right now!

43
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:56,032
federal agent!
She's a fedel agent!

44
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,231
Your girlfriend's
been turned by the fbi.

45
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,371
If you let her come to you, you're
risking your chances of escape.

46
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:04,551
I'll call my driver,
have him take care of her.

47
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:07,781
No. I'll take care of her.

48
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:12,781
*******

49
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:20,853
******

50
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,033
Sean, I need to talk to you.

51
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:31,962
- Is it important?
- You tell me.

52
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,773
- Did you issue a federal warrant on this vehicle?
- What?

53
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,370
I found a digital footprint on
server four's backup partition.

54
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:38,761
It originated from
your station.

55
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,372
- I'd like to know what the hell is going on!
- Keep your voice down.

56
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:43,410
You want to get us caught?

57
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:46,810
I sent out the warrant, to
sideline bauer and renee.

58
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:48,471
They were closing in on dubaku.

59
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,962
I thought you said dubaku's
on his way out of the country?

60
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:53,272
He is, but his
girlfriend's talking to fbi.

61
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,561
They used her to track him.

62
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:58,170
- Oh, my god.
- Don't worry, i took care of it.

63
00:02:58,288 --> 00:02:59,861
Bauer and renee are
in police custody.

64
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:02,933
By the time they're released,
dubaku will be long gone.

65
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,082
Are you sure?

66
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,253
I'm positive.

67
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,831
Why didn't you just tell
me what was happening?

68
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,642
'Cause I knew you'd
react like this.

69
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:15,513
The last thing I need right
now is one of your meltdowns.

70
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:19,882
Now, listen, I got you into this, and I'm going to
get you out of it, but not if you start panicking.

71
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:23,381
- You've got to keep it together.
- I'm just really scared, you know?

72
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:27,181
I know. I am, to I'm just a little
better at hiding it than you are.

73
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,622
I've got everything covered.

74
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,292
I ran a bounce-tap into the conference
room speakerphone that they'll never find,

75
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,082
and I can hear
everything they're saying.

76
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,861
Now, sit at your station.
Try and act normal.

77
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:42,693
Let me worry about
bauer and renee. Okay?

78
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,803
The man that we were tracking is
responsible for today's terrorist attack.

79
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,763
If you don't let us go,
he's going to get away.

80
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,981
Look, my captain's on the
phone with your superior.

81
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,111
You're making a mistake!
You've got to let us go!

82
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,332
That warrant had to be sent out
by one of dubaku's operatives.

83
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:05,140
I know.

84
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,250
Then dubaku knows that
marika is working with us.

85
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,821
He will kill her, jack. We should
not have used her like this.

86
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,823
We didn't have a choice.
She was our best asset.

87
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:14,672
She's not an asset,
jack. She's a human being.

88
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,272
Colonel.

89
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:35,903
The fbi is still
looking for us, sir.

90
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,620
I'll do this quickly.
Wait there for me.

91
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:45,271
Samuel.

92
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:48,791
- What is it? Sweetheart, what's wrong?
- Give me your cell phone.

93
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:49,913
My cell phone?

94
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,910
I know you've been
talking to the fbi.

95
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,490
You've been working
for them, marika.

96
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,411
I don't know what
you're talking about.

97
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,563
What are you doing?

98
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,161
I trusted you!

99
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:16,403
How could you do this to me?

100
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,291
The fbi told me
who you really are.

101
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:21,543
About the terrible
things you've done.

102
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,673
- And you believed them?
- They showed me proof!

103
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:26,941
They showed you lies
created by my enemies!

104
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:28,481
You don't know me.

105
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,460
And you don't know my country.

106
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:33,152
I brought peace to sangala.

107
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:40,561
no. Don't be afraid, huh?

108
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:41,893
It's just...

109
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:47,753
when I heard what you had done, it was like
you had driven a dagger through my heart.

110
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:52,373
I'm a forgiving man, marika.

111
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,791
I still want you
to come with me.

112
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,253
I want to give you the
life that I promised.

113
00:05:57,387 --> 00:06:00,540
I can't go with you.

114
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,681
I don't know who you are.

115
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,421
You do. You do.

116
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,552
If you look past your fear, you'll see that
I am still the man that you fell in love with.

117
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:17,991
I won't leave
without you, marika.

118
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:29,330
All right.

119
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:44,213
You won't be
disappointed. Come.

120
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,942
The fbi may be close.

121
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:51,950
Your story was verified by fbi.

122
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:53,803
I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

123
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,343
Did fbi find marika donoso?

124
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:57,301
I don't know.
You can ask them yourself.

125
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,113
Agent moss wants
to talk to you.

126
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:01,040
Larry, where are they?
Where's marika?

127
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,282
We lost her cell phone snal.

128
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:04,502
- What do you mean? What happened?
- Don't know.

129
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:06,223
- Just went dead about three minutes ago.
- Where?

130
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:10,101
In an alley on the northeast corner of n and
10th street. I'm looking through traffic cams now.

131
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:12,722
All right,
we're going to comm. Standby.

132
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:17,100
They lost marika's signa

133
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,192
- that's it.
- There.

134
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,740
Jack? We got a make on the car.

135
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:30,493
It's a dark gray jeep grand cherokee, turned
south on 11th street about two minutes ago.

136
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:32,261
Copy that. Moving to intercept.

137
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:35,352
- Did you see marika?
- Yes. She got in the car with dubaku.

138
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,070
Chloe, stay on
those traffic cams.

139
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:39,012
I'm on it.

140
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,293
We're ten minutes from the
airfield. Is my plane ready?

141
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:45,060
Fueled and waiting.

142
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,452
Did you take care
of the problem?

143
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:50,400
She's had a change of
heart. She's coming with me.

144
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,645
Colonel, she was
working with the fbi.

145
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,767
You were almost arrested
because of her.

146
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,953
She's not your concern.

147
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,081
You just worry about getting
me out of the country.

148
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:05,273
Who was that?

149
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:11,032
It was a government official. He's
been working for me. A very corrupt man.

150
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,963
I look forward tno longer
dealing with people like him.

151
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,912
I want to spend time with
people I really care about.

152
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,953
They're still on 11th. They just
crossed over to new york avenue.

153
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,100
Copy that.

154
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,852
- Come on!
- Jack, they're turning left.

155
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,653
Hold on.

156
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:07,143
- Fbi.
- Go! Go!

157
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:11,062
Hold on!

158
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:48,421
Get on top of the car! See
if you can maintain a visual.

159
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,591
Marika! marika!

160
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:03,370
Jack, they crashed!

161
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,653
Go!

162
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,833
Get back in your car!

163
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,581
Larry, dubaku's vehicle's
been involved in an accident.

164
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:13,951
- We need an ambulance, now!
- Copy.

165
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,973
Back away!

166
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:26,121
Stay on your knees!
Get on the ground, now!

167
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:28,103
Now!

168
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:36,032
I got dubaku.

169
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,291
agent walker,
the car is on fire.

170
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:56,890
Get out of there!

171
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:00,423
Get out of there!

172
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:09,772
I gave her my word,
so back off or help me.

173
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,221
It's her leg--
it's pinned.

174
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:27,181
Hold on.

175
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:31,481
pull... pull!

176
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:34,780
Go!

177
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:39,723
Jack.

178
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:42,173
Go.

179
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:48,092
You all right?

180
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:56,930
Larry, where is my ambulance?

181
00:11:57,075 --> 00:12:00,013
Dubaku's badly injured. He's
unconscious. I need that ambulance now.

182
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,773
They're on their way, jack.

183
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,950
Miral smith estimates we'll ve the
capitol of sangala secured within the hour.

184
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:42,813
He's surprised how little resistance
our troops have encountered.

185
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:48,630
And you'll be happy to know we have liberated
the refugee camp in kasanga province.

186
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:52,562
2,000 civilians are
safe from juma's forces.

187
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,791
Madam president?

188
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,923
I'm sorry, ethan.

189
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:03,563
Oh, my god, kasanga province.
That'S... that's very good news.

190
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:08,502
Uh, maybe we should
finish this another time.

191
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,181
Can I get you anything,
madam president?

192
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:14,480
No, thank you.

193
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:17,822
Would you like to
talk about it?

194
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:24,462
What happened to henry
was my fault, ethan.

195
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,690
He never believed our
son committed suicide.

196
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:31,350
He was right.

197
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,832
And I didn't listen to him.

198
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,932
And if I had, we wouldn't
be here right now.

199
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:40,693
Henry wouldn't be fighting for his life,
and we might have exposed this conspiracy.

200
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:44,071
Our government
wouldn't be ralyzed.

201
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,702
I didn't believe henry,
either. No one did.

202
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:49,952
But I'm his wife.

203
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:53,733
He deserved my trust.

204
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:58,041
Madam president?

205
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,421
I'm sorry to interrupt.

206
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:01,203
It's all right, bill. Go ahead.

207
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:04,912
I just spoke to larry moss
at fbi. We captured dubaku.

208
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:07,850
He was seriously injured in a
car crash during the pursuit.

209
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,031
- How bad?
- Critical, nonresponsive.

210
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:12,183
Jack bauer and agent
walker are with him.

211
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:14,863
They'll be there to question him
should he regain consciousness.

212
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:19,472
So, you're saying that if dubaku dies, our
chances of uncovering this conspiracy die with him.

213
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,780
He could be the only one who knows the names of
everyone in the government he's corrupted-- yes.

214
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:27,691
Madam president, given this latest news, I
don't think it's safe for you to remain here.

215
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,742
I strongly urge you to
return to the white house.

216
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,572
I'd prefer to stay
with my husband.

217
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:34,041
You're too exposed. I can't
effectively protect you.

218
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,502
Am I any safer at
the white house?

219
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:39,902
My administration has
been corrupted, bill,

220
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:42,401
and now you're telling me we're
about to lose our only lead.

221
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:46,161
Madam president, I assure you I've taken
every precaution to secure the white house.

222
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,690
It's the safest place
for you to be right now.

223
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:53,400
Henry will be in surgery for
several hours, madam president.

224
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,261
There's nothing more
we can do here.

225
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:59,500
You are needed in
the oval office.

226
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:08,012
All right.

227
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:09,491
I'll have the cars
brought around.

228
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:11,940
I'll also redirect your daughter's
escorts to the white house.

229
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:13,930
Thank you, bill.

230
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:21,400
What are we going to do, ethan?

231
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:25,561
How can we possibly run this government
when we don't know who we can trust?

232
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:29,073
We'll just have to pray jack bauer
can get those names from dubaku.

233
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:36,630
You got him stabilized?

234
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,040
Yes, sir. We're
transporting him right now.

235
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,490
Bring him around.
I need to talk to him.

236
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,712
Sir, he's in no condition
to speak right now.

237
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:43,873
This man has information vital to
national security-- bring him around now.

238
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:45,410
Now!

239
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,863
One milligram epinephrine.

240
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:56,612
I know you can hear me.
You're in federal custody.

241
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:58,583
These paramedics are
trying to save your life.

242
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:01,140
You want them to continue, you're
gonna tell me what I want to know.

243
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:04,851
I want the names of everyone in the united
states government that you've been working with.

244
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:08,283
Come on. You and i both know
the game. It's over for you now.

245
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:11,411
There's no sense in
trying to protect them.

246
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:14,842
You and I, we're both soldiers.

247
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:18,490
I know you don't care about your
own life, but you got a family.

248
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,052
I know where your
son is in sangala.

249
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:22,773
I know where he lives, and I swear
to you, I will track him down,

250
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:27,920
and I will make him suffer, and I will make
sure that he knows his father was responsible.

251
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:31,520
All you got to do to make
me stop is give me the names.

252
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,511
Just give me the names.

253
00:16:33,646 --> 00:16:36,333
Don't hurt my family.

254
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:40,170
I have a list... list.

255
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:41,960
Where is the list?

256
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:44,263
- His bp's spiking.
- Give me the list. Where is the list?

257
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:45,840
- He's going into cardiac arrest.
- Bring him back!

258
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:50,213
Get the paddles. Start
at 200 joules. clear.

259
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:54,441
No response-- there's a
glitch. Once more. clear.

260
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,120
There it is again.
Electronic interference.

261
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:59,972
This could be it-- feels like
a metal plate or something.

262
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,882
All right.
Amping up to 300. clear.

263
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:04,282
- Where's the plate?
- All right.

264
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,650
He's stabilized--
let's get him boarded.

265
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,112
- Where's the plate?
- It's below his rib cage.

266
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:09,171
Open him up.

267
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:11,343
Sir, we don't have time. I
have to ask you to step aside.

268
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:15,210
You open him up now. Do it.

269
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,990
Sir, this man will die if we
don't get him to the hospital.

270
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,253
Get him out of here.

271
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,422
FBI.

272
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:48,582
Patch me through to agent moss.

273
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:50,523
- This is moss.
- Larry, it's jack.

274
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:51,331
Go ahead, jack.

275
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:54,502
I found some kind of digital storage
device implanted under dubaku's skin.

276
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,980
- What is it?
- In an effort to protect his family,

277
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:59,503
he said he would provide me with a list
of all of his U.S.Government contacts.

278
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:01,783
He said it was on him;
he meant, in him.

279
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:04,113
Larry, this is his insurance
policy. I'm sure of it.

280
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:07,470
Jack, we need that data as soon as
possible. Can you upload the files to fbi?

281
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,792
I don't think so. I've
never seen anything like it.

282
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:14,742
Hold on one second.
Officer. Officer.

283
00:18:15,248 --> 00:18:17,310
My name is jack bauer.
I'm working with the fbi.

284
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,161
I need you to get this device
to regional headquarters.

285
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,892
I want you to give it
to an agent larry moss.

286
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:22,983
You put this in his hands,
his hands only. You understand?

287
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,532
- Yes, sir.
- Do it.

288
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,253
Larry, you got a
chopper coming your way.

289
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:29,000
You should have the drive in five
minutes. We're gonna stay with dubaku.

290
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:30,863
Get back to us as soon
as you got anything.

291
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,340
Copy that.

292
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:46,183
Sean. What is it? What's wrong?

293
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:48,031
Just listen to me, and
try not to overreact.

294
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:50,741
Okay, we have a situation, but
I think I ha a way to handle it.

295
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,592
What situation? You told me you
had everything under control.

296
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:57,673
I do...
but they have dubaku's database.

297
00:18:57,787 --> 00:18:58,691
What?

298
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,720
Sean, our names are on that list.You
told me that you were taking care of this,

299
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,112
and now you're telling me
that they have our names?

300
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,270
No, they don't have our
nes yet, so here's the plan.

301
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:08,203
Sean, we have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here right now!

302
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,602
- I'm not going to jail, sean! Do you hear me?
- Nobody's going to jail. I promise.

303
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,652
I'm sick of your promises. You promised
me that this is all taken care of.

304
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,373
You promised me you're
leaving your wife.

305
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,190
You make all these promises,
but you never keep any of them!

306
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:21,643
St talking, and just listen to me--
now, I told you I have a way out of this,

307
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:23,773
but I need your help,
do you understand that?

308
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:26,801
Now, listen... okay?

309
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:31,503
As soon as o'brian downloads those files,
we're gonna crash the entire system,

310
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:34,050
every single server
on this floor.

311
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,362
That's crazy.

312
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:38,912
No, it's not crazy. We're gonna
go up to the mainframe room...

313
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:41,892
initiate a
system-wide reformat.

314
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:44,773
We'll wipe everything clean, and
they won't be able to stop it.

315
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:48,520
We're gonna have to bypass a
lot of safety protocols, okay?

316
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:52,260
But nobody's better at dealing
with those servers than you are.

317
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:55,530
Isn't that true?

318
00:19:56,968 --> 00:20:01,443
I need your help. I
can't do this without you.

319
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,010
Erika?

320
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,733
Yeah. Okay.

321
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:19,522
we're gonna have to...

322
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:22,503
tie the main servers together.

323
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,931
I need an avi motherboard, but you're gonna
have to reconfigure it for a macro uplink.

324
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:28,620
Okay, and we have to hurry.

325
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:31,262
The drive is gonna
be here any minute.

326
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:33,241
Go up to the mainframe
room and get started.

327
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,583
I'm gonna prep the motherboard.
I'll meet you up there.

328
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,741
- Okay.
- Okay.

329
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:43,050
We're gonna be fine.

330
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:46,983
I love you.

331
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:52,430
- I love you, too.
- Okay, let's go.

332
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,330
these are marika
donoso's personal effects.

333
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,611
- Thank you.
- Copy that. Get back to me.

334
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:29,722
That was larry.
They got the drive.

335
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:30,980
Chloe's gonna be
working on them.

336
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,242
They should have something
in the next few minutes.

337
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,443
That's all that matters,
right, jack?

338
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,672
I don't like what happened to
marika any more than you do.

339
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:41,352
We did what was necessary. You better
figure out a way to live with it.

340
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,923
How, jack? Pretend that it never
happened? Is it that easy for you?

341
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:50,411
I'll let you know when
chloe's got something.

342
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,853
Here it is.

343
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,771
This is a px-1-7 drive. It's
got an auto-erase function.

344
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,080
We've only got one download.

345
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:35,270
where have you been?

346
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,903
Just took a little
longer than I thought.

347
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:44,292
- what are you doing?
- Checking surveillance.

348
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,211
Got to keep an eye on
larry and o'brian.

349
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:50,432
Once we do this, they're gonna realize
someone's up here in a few seconds.

350
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,493
We'll have to make
a clean exit.

351
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,200
How much longer is
this going to take?

352
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:59,831
I just have to bypass
safety protocols.

353
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:02,210
once they're down,
I'll start the reformat.

354
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:07,223
Go ahead.

355
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,422
Dubaku hasn't arrived at the airfield,
and he's not answering his cell phone.

356
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,331
- What's going on?
- Fbi got him.

357
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:13,820
What?

358
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,740
How long have you
known about this?

359
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:18,202
They're not going to get anything out
of him. He's unconscious in the hospital.

360
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:20,480
There was a crash
during a chase.

361
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,861
Listen, the fbi recovered that database
you told me about, the list of names.

362
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:25,793
I'm in the process
of deleting it.

363
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,151
I'm going to erase
every trace of it.

364
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:29,191
I don't have to tell you what
will happen if they get that list.

365
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,503
They won'T. I'm gonna
take care of the database.

366
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:33,330
You need to take
care of dubaku.

367
00:23:33,465 --> 00:23:35,780
- Don't worry about him. You just make sure...
- Damn it!

368
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:37,503
I got to go. What's wrong?

369
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:40,030
- It-it isn't working. - What
do you mean, it isn't working?

370
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:43,600
All the inputs are active, the servers
are aligned, but the reformat won't start.

371
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:44,871
It doesn't make any sense.

372
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:47,443
Okay, well, just-just think
it through, erika. Right?

373
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:49,743
- You can do this.
- Would you just shut up? Okay?

374
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:56,901
Okay. Has to be server three. all right,
server three was upgraded last week.

375
00:23:57,427 --> 00:24:01,462
Which means they rtored the partitions
to the system default settings.

376
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,033
How could I be so stupid?

377
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:08,971
I just have to configure
the parameters.

378
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:11,972
Okay.

379
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:20,320
okay? Is that it?

380
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:23,400
I think so.

381
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,090
Program's running.

382
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:32,402
what? What's happening?
What's going on?

383
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:34,140
- The hard drive's reformatting.
- What?

384
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:36,451
The files are being erased.
We're losing everything.

385
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,800
- Well, make it stop.
- I don't have the access.

386
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:41,522
- Get the px-1-7 out. -
It's too late. It's erased.

387
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:48,862
This is deliberate. It's not a glitch.
Someone's trying to crash the system.

388
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:51,581
- Where's your mainframe room?
- Come on.

389
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:59,062
Here they come. We
got to get out of here.

390
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,652
- Almost there.
- Erika...

391
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,143
- it's done.
- Are you sure?

392
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:07,312
Yeah. It'll take a few minutes for the reformat
to be complete, but there's no stopping it.

393
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:11,843
- Oh, baby. I knew you could do it.
- Yeah. We gonna be okay?

394
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:16,021
We're gonna be fine.

395
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:48,632
sorry.

396
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:12,363
- get on the floor!
- It wasn't me!

397
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,922
Get on the floor!

398
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,250
larry, it wasn't me.

399
00:26:27,347 --> 00:26:28,262
Chloe!

400
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:29,982
Larry, I followed her up here.

401
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:32,123
She was trying to
crash the system.

402
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,921
She shot me!

403
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:35,883
I we for the weapon,
and it went off.

404
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:36,912
Security, this is agent moss.

405
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:38,741
I need a team to lock
down the mainframe room.

406
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:39,892
And get a medic up here!

407
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,693
Chloe, can you
recover the files?

408
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:44,310
- I don't know yet.
- What files? What the hell is happening?

409
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,191
You tell me what the
hell is happening, sean!

410
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:48,600
You were stting me out, larry,
so I looked around on my own.

411
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:51,392
I found out that erika was
rerouting the sub-cam channel!

412
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,041
What the hell was she doing?

413
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,612
She sent out a-a warrant on
a vehicle with two suspects.

414
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:58,043
I knew something was wrong.
That's not part of her job.

415
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,213
I asked her about it,
and she tried to deny it.

416
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:01,633
She was acting very strangely.

417
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:02,913
Why didn't you say anything?

418
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:05,952
I don't know what the hell it meant,
so I hacked into her hard drive,

419
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:08,331
and I found schematics
for the main server.

420
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:10,790
Bypass codes for the
safety protocols.

421
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:13,212
I followed her up here
to see what she was up to.

422
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:18,183
The second I realized she was trying
to crash the system, I-I confronted her.

423
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:20,972
She shot me.

424
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:23,661
I went for the gun.

425
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:26,023
Larry, I didn't
mean to kill her.

426
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:28,933
Halt! Halt!

427
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:32,431
Larry, it's too late. The system's
fried. Dubaku's files are gone.

428
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:34,490
Are you sure?
Can you recover anything?

429
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:37,900
The server's wiped
clean. She got everything.

430
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,602
Is this everything you got?

431
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:58,372
No, it's not.I didn't have time
to print out every single message

432
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:03,470
that came through erika's workstation. That's
everything she was doing for the past three days.

433
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,121
Look, larry, I told you what happened.
I feel like you owe me an explanation.

434
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,882
What the hell is going on here?

435
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,571
the government's been
compromised by dubaku.

436
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:21,081
Fbi, secret service.
God knows who else.

437
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:23,490
That's why I shut you out,
brought in chloe o'brian.

438
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:27,682
We were in the middle of decrypting a file that
had the names of everyone on dubaku's payroll.

439
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,482
Erika erased it when
she wiped the server.

440
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:32,190
That was our only lead.

441
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:35,322
You should have told me about
this. You should have trusted me.

442
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:37,981
Sean, I didn't
know who to trust.

443
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:41,781
You all right? How's your arm?

444
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:43,971
It hurts like hell. It's fine.

445
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,603
When you're up for it, I'm gonna
need you to write a statement.

446
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:47,530
Okay.

447
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:49,780
And keep your mouth shut.

448
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:53,880
we don't know who else in this building
might be working for dubaku. Yeah.

449
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:55,520
Larry, don't ask me how,
but I did it.

450
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:55,610
You did what?

451
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:58,890
I recovered dubaku's files.

452
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,681
What?

453
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:02,823
I was running a mirror
file on an outside server.

454
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:05,350
I always do that when I'm
dealing with sensitive materials.

455
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:08,123
Erika's parameters were
too narrow to catch it.

456
00:29:08,835 --> 00:29:10,711
How soon can you
have it decrypted?

457
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,701
It's decrypted. It's been
decrypting this entire time.

458
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,582
Dubaku kept detailed
evidence on everyone.

459
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,730
Phone logs, financial
records-- it's all here.

460
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,353
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
cross-check with fbi personnel.

461
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:23,523
Sean said erika was working by
herself, but I got to be 100% sure.

462
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:26,900
- Okay. Hold on.
- Yeah.

463
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,850
Chloe recovered the files.

464
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:35,421
That's great.

465
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:38,063
- I should get to that statement.
- Yeah.

466
00:29:40,597 --> 00:29:42,173
Sean?

467
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:45,433
When you're done there, I want you
to go downstairs and see dr. Weber.

468
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:48,500
You shot a fellow agent. You're
gonna want to talk to somebody.

469
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,571
Yes, sir.

470
00:30:06,057 --> 00:30:08,253
Hey, do you have any idea
what's going on with the servers?

471
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,232
Not a clue.

472
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:10,400
The whole system's down.

473
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,580
I tried to get into the mainframe room,
and security has got it locked off.

474
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:15,410
Ask larry about it, janis.

475
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,441
Where are you going?

476
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:20,212
- I got to run an errand.
- Now?

477
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:58,000
- All right, all right.
- Hold off.

478
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:04,083
you better start
talking to me right now!

479
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:09,182
I'd like to speak
with my attorney.

480
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:15,262
Put him in holding.

481
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:24,842
Yes.sir.

482
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,923
get me bill buchanan
at the white house.

483
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:43,492
where is my sister?
Where's marika?

484
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,863
There was an accident.

485
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:49,380
What happened?

486
00:31:49,495 --> 00:31:51,242
Marika didn't make it.

487
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:53,762
What-what do you mean?

488
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,382
There was a crash. Uh, it
happened during the pursuit.

489
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:00,442
Marika was killed.

490
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,301
I don't understand.

491
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:05,851
You said that you'd protect
her. You said she'd be okay.

492
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,742
We wouldn't have caught
dubaku without marika's help.

493
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,420
She was very, very brave, rosa.

494
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,350
What is this?

495
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:18,300
This is supposed to
make everything okay?

496
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,431
Marika was all I had!

497
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:25,131
I trusted you with her
life, and you let her die?

498
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:28,401
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't touch me!

499
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:34,383
you killed my sister!

500
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:38,592
You didn't care how you
did it or who got hurt!

501
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:44,242
Agent walker?

502
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:51,550
Excuse me.

503
00:32:58,118 --> 00:33:01,073
I just got o the phone with
larry. Dubaku wasn't lying.

504
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:04,672
On the drive was a list of everyone
he was working with in the government.

505
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,440
They're getting ready to
make arrests. It's over.

506
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:14,431
It's not over for rosa.

507
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:19,992
What happened to
marika was a tragedy.

508
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:23,702
But I'm not going to stand here and tell you
what we did was wrong, because we weren'T.

509
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:27,472
She made a choice, a brave one,
to get involved, but she made it.

510
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,363
God, listen to yourself, jack. You don't
even sound human. Don't you feel anything?

511
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:32,692
We had a job to do!

512
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:36,732
To protect the hundreds if not thousands of
innocent lives that would not have had a choice

513
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:39,352
if we let a terrorist
attack take place.

514
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:45,070
What we did wasn't
wrong. It was necessary.

515
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,161
I read your file.

516
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:52,242
When your wife was killed, did you feel that or
did you just tell yourself that that was necessary?

517
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:54,532
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

518
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:56,821
I just want to know
that you feel something!

519
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,710
I want to know that you feel
the same kind of pain that I do!

520
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:03,870
Do you feel that?
Do you feel that?

521
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:13,893
it's all right.

522
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,503
You're going to be all right.

523
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:23,413
It's going to take a while.

524
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:25,572
But you will learn
to live with it.

525
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:29,073
What if I don't want to
learn to live with it?

526
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:32,351
Then quit.

527
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:37,931
And by the way, that stunt
you pulled by the car...

528
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:43,773
you ever pull your weapon on my
again, you better intend to use it.

529
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:46,791
I did.

530
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:17,283
- olivia.
- What's going on?

531
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:19,743
How's dad?

532
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:23,932
He's still in surgery.
We're waiting for word.

533
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,533
Is he going to be all right?

534
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:29,240
He was seriously injured.

535
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,872
The bullet went
through his lung.

536
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:36,300
Livy.

537
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:40,503
The doctors are doing
everything they can.

538
00:35:41,048 --> 00:35:43,673
Who did this?

539
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:46,720
It's complicated.

540
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:50,080
I want to know who
shot my father!

541
00:35:50,488 --> 00:35:54,911
Your father found out about a
conspiracy inside the government.

542
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:56,950
The people behind it
tried to kill him.

543
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:58,133
Who are these people?

544
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:01,031
We're trying to
find out right now.

545
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:03,602
That's all i can tell you.

546
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:05,121
Okay, I want to go
to the hospital.

547
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:08,200
- I want to be there when he wakes up.
- I can't let you do that.

548
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:11,331
The people who shot your father
are still out there. It's not safe.

549
00:36:11,446 --> 00:36:13,203
I don't care,
I want to see dad!

550
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,232
This is not a debate.

551
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:16,621
I'm not going to risk
anything happening to you.

552
00:36:16,737 --> 00:36:20,011
You're staying in the white
house, and that's the end of it.

553
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:23,000
Madam president, bill
buchanan is here to see you.

554
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:25,871
I'll be right out.

555
00:36:28,406 --> 00:36:32,003
There's a lot we need
to talk out, olivia.

556
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:36,303
We've been ignoring
things for far too long.

557
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:39,901
It took dad getting shot for
you to finally want to talk?

558
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,991
Let's not go down this path.

559
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:46,940
Not again. Not today.

560
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:51,360
We'll talk later.

561
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:54,182
One of the guards will take
you up to the residence.

562
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,881
All right, bill. What is it?

563
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:08,131
I have very good news.

564
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:10,661
Jack bauer just recovered
a database hidden on dubaku.

565
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,260
It contains the names of everyone in
the government who was working with him.

566
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:15,073
Homany?

567
00:37:15,197 --> 00:37:17,701
Close to a hundred people,
across all agencies.

568
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,813
- Some at very high levels.
- My god.

569
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:22,443
Dubaku kept detailed
files on every person.

570
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,433
This is exactly what we've been
working toward, madam president.

571
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:28,330
We can finally put an
end to this conspiracy.

572
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,801
I assume you've already begun
acting on this information.

573
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:34,911
Yes.As a matter of fact, larry moss
just identified two more individuals

574
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:37,633
working within fbi
who were on the list.

575
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:40,071
He's confident the
bureau is secure.

576
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:41,451
What's the next step?

577
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:44,232
I'm working with fbi to
coordinate an interagency sweep.

578
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,380
We should start making
arrests within the hour.

579
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,662
Bill, I don't know what
to say to thank you.

580
00:37:49,786 --> 00:37:53,022
What you have done here today
puts all of us in your debt.

581
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:57,792
I appreciate that, madam president,
but there are a lot of people to thank,

582
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:00,341
including jack bauer.

583
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:05,880
He's scheduled to resume his testimony
before the senate committee tomorrow morning.

584
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:06,922
I'm aware of that.

585
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,362
Madam president, forgive
me if I'm out of line,

586
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:14,331
but I feel senator mayer is on
a personal crusade against jack.

587
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:16,572
'S already taken
his pound of flesh.

588
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:21,500
He dismantled ctu, attacked the reputations of
people who've served this country with honor.

589
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:24,000
Now he wants to make
an example of jack.

590
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:28,691
It isn't right, madam president,
especially after today.

591
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:30,453
What are you asking
me to do, bill?

592
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:33,840
I'm asking you to
speak to senator mayer.

593
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:36,742
Jack bau helped
save this country.

594
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:40,292
He doesn't deserve to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

595
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:45,913
I appreciate your sentiments, bill, but
I'm going to have to think about this.

596
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:49,442
That's all I'm asking,
madam president. Thank you.

597
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:23,953
What the hell are
you doing here?

598
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,641
- I need to talk with you.
- About what?

599
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,613
I told you I was going
to follow up on a lead.

600
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:31,741
No, you said you were going to turn
yourself in as soon as this was over.

601
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:34,692
And I will.
But this ain't over yet.

602
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,591
There's going to be
another attack.Here in D.C.

603
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:39,573
Dubaku is in custody.

604
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:42,570
He's already provided us with a list of eryone
in the government that was working with him.

605
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,771
It's not dubaku.

606
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:47,481
It's his boss, juma.

607
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:50,310
He knows he's about to
lose control of his country.

608
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,863
So he's going to try and rally his people
behind him by striking back at the U.S.

609
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,710
How do you know this?

610
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:58,771
- I tracked down a source.
- What source?

611
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:02,300
He was one of the men I
worked with on emerson's crew.

612
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:06,261
He had a direct line of communication
with the juma regime in sangala.

613
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:12,101
It wasn't easy getting the information out
of him, but I'm convinced it's accurate.

614
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:14,342
- Then you should hand it over to fbi.
- No.

615
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:18,610
My source tells me that the
window opens at 1900 hours.

616
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:23,202
By the time the fbi wades through their
procedures and red tape, it's going to be too late.

617
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:27,483
What's the target?

618
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:30,472
He doesn't know
the exact target,

619
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:34,771
but it's definitely going to be
of high value and high impact.

620
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:39,192
He gave me the name of somebody
who's been involved in the planning.

621
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:41,151
Who?

622
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:44,113
Ryan burnett.

623
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:47,082
Senator mayer's chief of staff.

624
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,231
That's right.

625
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,102
He's been involved
from the very beginning.

626
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:54,661
- What about mayer?
- No. He's not involved.

627
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:57,551
- You're sure about that?
- Yeah.

628
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:03,300
You better not be
lying to me, tony.

629
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:08,522
This is real, jack.

630
00:41:10,525 --> 00:41:12,151
Burnett will be
on dubaku's list.

631
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:15,532
As soon as he finds out that dubaku's
in custody, he'll start running.

632
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:16,893
You don't have a lot of time.

633
00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:19,502
I've already got a tail on him.

634
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:26,992
listen, jack, if you're with me, meet me
at the corner of first and constitution.

635
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:39,931
I need your help.

636
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:54,002
Thank you for your patience.

637
00:41:54,116 --> 00:41:58,181
As I'm sure some of you already know,
our government and its ancillary agencies,

638
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:04,042
including this office, have been infiltrated
by operatives in league with ike dubaku.

639
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,962
yes, senator?

640
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:09,943
Ryan, can you step in here?

641
00:42:10,056 --> 00:42:11,911
Yes, sir.

642
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:22,572
- I'm going to the white house.
- Sir?

643
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:26,902
President taylor wants to speak
to me regarding jack bauer.

644
00:42:27,025 --> 00:42:29,010
Bauer? What about him?

645
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:32,950
I don't know, but we'll
find out soon enough.

646
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,932
- It's odd, though.
- What is, sir?

647
00:42:36,376 --> 00:42:40,463
Bauer was pulled away from the senate hearings
this morning to help the fbi with an investigation.

648
00:42:40,597 --> 00:42:44,211
And now the president wants
to talk to me about him.

649
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,233
I don't like the
timing of this.

650
00:42:47,345 --> 00:42:50,983
Grab your laptop, ryan.
I want you there with me.

651
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:57,023
Yes, sir. <font color=#00FFFF>-=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly
