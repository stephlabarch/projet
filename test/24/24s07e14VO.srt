1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,340
Previously on 24

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,950
We need to pick him off to
try to save the president.

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,680
I'll make a run for
the lockdown room.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,750
There are five
canisters of ch-4.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,750
All we need is
one stray bullet.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,790
A suicide play,jack.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,220
We don't have a choice.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,230
Don't you move!

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,700
We have the president!

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,970
The president is secure!

11
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:36,335
I'm so sorry,jack.

12
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,947
I know that he was your friend.

13
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,343
It was supposed to be me.

14
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,112
Juma and his men were
not working alone.

15
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:43,303
And right now,the only lead
we've got is ryan burnett.

16
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,102
He knew about the attack
on the white house,

17
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:48,011
And chances are,he's gonna
know who juma was talking to.

18
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:49,451
I'm thinking about

19
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:51,051
Bringing olivia on

20
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,652
As a special advisor.

21
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:56,013
Nobody's forgotten what she
did during the campaign.

22
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,822
Leaking damaging
personal information

23
00:00:57,998 --> 00:00:59,392
About your opponent
to the press.

24
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:00,893
She's changed.

25
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,660
It's not the past
that concerns me.

26
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:03,891
Do you think any of this

27
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,060
Would've happened if my
mother had a chief advisor

28
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,321
Who knew what the hell was
going on in her administration?

29
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,372
I just got off the
phone with ethan kanin.

30
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:13,401
He's ordering me to let
bauer interrogate burnett.

31
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,273
Look,i didn't want to
go behind your back,

32
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:16,843
But you didn't
leave me any choice.

33
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:18,340
I want you to clean
out your office

34
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,640
And hand in your badge.

35
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:20,941
I'm suspending you.

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,181
Jack bauer's on his way to
kennedy memorial hospital.

37
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:25,681
Burnett will tell
him everything.

38
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:27,872
I have already sent
somebody to the hospital

39
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,191
To deal with burnett.

40
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,552
He can take care of
bauer at the same time.

41
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:33,192
You lay one finger
on him,it's over.

42
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,863
Right.

43
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:37,692
Juma's attack failed.

44
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,501
He's dead,so are his men.

45
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,373
Somebody get me the
hell out of here!

46
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:43,703
You're not going anywhere.

47
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:44,831
What happened?

48
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:45,942
What's going on?

49
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:57,081
Damn it,bauer,open the door!

50
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:01,723
I want a high-priority
apb issued for jack bauer.

51
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:03,542
Larry,it's jack. listen to me.

52
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm being set up.

53
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,391
Don't let them get
away with this.

54
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:08,033
This threat is not over.

55
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:13,131
The following takes place between 9 p.m.
and 10 p.m.

56
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,420
I dropped my wife off
here five hours ago,

57
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,201
And now no one can
tell me where she is.

58
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:17,382
Mr. o'brian,the white
house has been attacked.

59
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,020
We're in the midst of
an urgent protocol.

60
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:20,553
Exactly. that's why i'd like to

61
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:22,003
know if my wife all right.

62
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:23,230
She is; she's fine.

63
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:25,273
Where is she?

64
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:26,471
Tell me.

65
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,471
She's in a holding room
on the third floor.

66
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,173
What...? she's been arrested.

67
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,042
That's absurd.

68
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,940
What's she charged with?
i want to see her.

69
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,842
Listen,i've already told
you more than i should have.

70
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,042
When agent moss
returns,he'll tell you

71
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:38,111
Everything you need to know.

72
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,372
In the meanwhile,i'm gonna have

73
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,211
To ask you to wait in
the conference room,okay?

74
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,051
Please. i'm sorry.

75
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,812
Please escort him to
the conference room.

76
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:43,940
Thank you.

77
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,120
Janis,larry's calling for you.

78
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,192
He says it's urgent.

79
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:50,392
What line? three.

80
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:53,031
Sign here,verifying
you understand

81
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,831
The terms of your suspension,

82
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,233
And again here...

83
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,901
Agent walker?

84
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:59,070
Go ahead, i'm listening.

85
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,143
Larry,it's janis.

86
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:02,912
Ryan burnett is dead.

87
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:04,070
How?

88
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:06,303
Bauer was interrogating
him when it happened,

89
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,683
And we're responsible.

90
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,651
You're saying that
bauer killed burnett?

91
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,851
I don't know.

92
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,980
He escaped before
i could get to him.

93
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:14,640
He called me,said he was being

94
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:16,322
set up and he wouldn't come in.

95
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,321
I lost him,janis.

96
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:22,492
I lost him,and it's
on me to find him.

97
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:23,831
Just tell me what you need.

98
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,363
I already sent out a
priority,all-agency apb.

99
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:28,033
I need you to
follow up on that.

100
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,401
I'm coming back to
the office right now.

101
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:33,003
I'll coordinate the search
operation from there.

102
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,042
Okay.

103
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:36,440
Open an all-agency channel

104
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:38,833
With flags for immediate
action on jack bauer.

105
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,333
I'll make sure the
local police departments

106
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,241
Are linked in.

107
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:42,250
On it. thank you.

108
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,611
Janis,what did larry say?

109
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,170
Jack get anything
out of burnett?

110
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:45,970
You're suspended.

111
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:47,541
I cannot discuss this with you.

112
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:48,850
Janis,this was my case.

113
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,852
Tell me if jack got
anything out of burnett.

114
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,122
Burnett is dead.

115
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:55,022
Well,tell me what happened.

116
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,032
Bauer was there,and
now he's missing.

117
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:00,462
Janis,the channel's open.

118
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:01,530
Thank you.

119
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,030
That's all i know,honestly.

120
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,200
So,please,let me get
back to work,okay?

121
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,870
Please attach jack bauer's
profile to the apb.

122
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,931
Got you.

123
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:46,510
Walker.

124
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:47,510
Renee,it's jack.

125
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:48,953
Don't hang up the phone,please.

126
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,152
Whatever they told you,i
did not kill burnett.

127
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:53,280
Renee?

128
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:54,363
Yeah.

129
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:55,231
Bill was right.

130
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,942
There are still very
powerful people

131
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:58,650
Involved in this conspiracy
that were not named

132
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,562
In dubaku's drive.

133
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:01,483
They're trying to
cover their tracks.

134
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:03,450
They killed burnett,and
they're framing me for it.

135
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,930
Even if i wanted
to help you,jack,

136
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,993
Larry has every law enforcement
agency within 100 miles

137
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,623
Looking for you,and i
have been suspended.

138
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,301
All i want you to
do is make an i.d.

139
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,493
I got a frame grab from the
hospital's surveillance.

140
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:13,441
I sent you a photo

141
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,942
Of the man who
did kill burnett.

142
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:17,343
It's in your inbox.

143
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:20,510
Renee,this man is

144
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:22,775
The only connection i
have to whoever else

145
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,017
Is involved in this thing.

146
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:27,323
Please,i need your help.

147
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:28,660
Look,i know you don't agree

148
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,123
with some of thing i did to the

149
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:34,261
But... i'm telling
you the truth.

150
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,661
Renee?

151
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:40,662
You know what?

152
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:41,931
Forget it. i'm-i'm sorry.

153
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:42,901
I made a mistake.

154
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,830
I'll call you back
at this number.

155
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:52,143
Metro police,

156
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:53,510
This is the fbi reporting.

157
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:55,983
We have a suspect,jack
bauer,that's escaped custody.

158
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:57,951
All available
units,please respond.

159
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:07,920
Yes,quinn.

160
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,831
Bauer got away from the fbi.

161
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:10,691
How?

162
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:11,560
Well,bauer is

163
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,451
An extremely
impressive operative.

164
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,100
You don't have to tell me that.

165
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:18,003
But the fbi has launched a
major effort to apprehend him.

166
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:20,270
He won't be able to
avoid them for long.

167
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,441
Well,we'll see,won't we?

168
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,912
Monitor the situation,keep
me apprised.

169
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,243
Yes,sir.

170
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,913
If bauer connects us to juma,

171
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,840
It could seriously
impede this operation.

172
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:32,920
Yes,it could.

173
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,690
Is the shipment on time?

174
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,261
Yes. due into port
in the next hour.

175
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:41,522
Then I don't foresee a problem.

176
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,062
Once the weapons are deployed,

177
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,592
Then it doesn't matter what mr.
bauer or anyone else knows.

178
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,631
Something wrong?

179
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:52,240
No,sir.

180
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:56,240
Mr. seaton,I get no pleasure

181
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,042
From the knowledge that
people will die at our hands.

182
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:05,080
One single soul,the loss of
one soul is tragic to me,

183
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,480
Let alone the numbers
we're talking about!

184
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:09,522
But do not forget
that every war

185
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,761
Worth fighting involves
collateral damage.

186
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,562
And what we're doing

187
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,960
Is fundamentally and
absolutely necessary!

188
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:17,963
And I know you understand that!

189
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,533
Of course.

190
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,272
Wake up our colleagues

191
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,241
And have them
assembled in one hour.

192
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,212
And tell them to pack their
pajamas and their toothbrushes.

193
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,653
It's gonna be a long night.

194
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:50,693
Yeah?

195
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,601
- I have an I.D. - Who is it?

196
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:53,762
John quinn.

197
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,201
Black ops combat vet.

198
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,972
Served tours all
over the world.

199
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,542
Now he works for starkwood.

200
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,631
The defense consultant?

201
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,433
Uh,yeah,they started
out as consultants,

202
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,231
But over the past few
years,while you were

203
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:04,932
Out of the country,the
pentagon outsourced

204
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,881
Billions of dollars
in contracts to them.

205
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:07,981
What kind of contracts?

206
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,312
Manpower.

207
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,973
Starkwood's basically
a private army.

208
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:12,742
They recruit ex-soldiers
and swat team members

209
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:13,740
From around the world,

210
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,411
Then they hire them back to
the military security teams.

211
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:19,192
We're talking thousands of
men deployed here and abroad.

212
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:20,520
Starkwood work with juma?

213
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:22,530
Well,if they did,it
wasn't on the books.

214
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:25,561
But,you know,if anyone
knows,it's senator mayer.

215
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:28,001
Why mayer?

216
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:29,142
After he dismantled ctu,

217
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,823
He launched several
other investigations.

218
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,493
One of them has been
looking at starkwood.

219
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,942
What were they accused of?

220
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,443
The hearings are classified,but

221
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,311
Supposedly,mayer has enough
to put them out of business.

222
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:39,943
Okay,i'm gonna need
to talk to him.

223
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:41,580
See if you can access
the CIRG logs.

224
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,251
They should have
a location on him.

225
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,181
Okay. i'll send you mayer's
location as soon as i have it.

226
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,551
Thanks.

227
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:51,921
Agent walker still here?

228
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:53,180
She was just in her office.

229
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,850
But there's somebody
waiting to see you

230
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,532
In the conference room.
they need to...

231
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,293
Just have a few more
forms to fill out,

232
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:24,221
Then I'm taking off.

233
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:25,961
You hear what happened
at the hospital?

234
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,622
After everything that
jack's done today,

235
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,613
Do you really believe
that he murdered Burnett?

236
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:33,533
I don't know.

237
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:35,263
I... I don't care.

238
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:37,371
He's a federal fugitive
and needs to be found.

239
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:40,843
But you think it's
possible that he did this?

240
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm not sure I do.

241
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,040
It's been a long day.

242
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:50,282
Go home,get some sleep.

243
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,223
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.

244
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,031
Excuse me,Larry.

245
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,633
Morris o'brian is waiting
in the conference room.

246
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:10,872
He wants to know why
his wife is in holding.

247
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,840
Renee talked to bauer.

248
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,773
How do you know?

249
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,643
Access her phone log
for the last 15 minutes

250
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,320
And get into her workstation,

251
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:22,400
find out what she's been doing

252
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:23,980
All right.

253
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:26,521
If we want to catch
bauer,she's our best shot.

254
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,693
Okay.

255
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,030
We've received confirmation
that president taylor

256
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:40,523
will be making a statement
to the country shortly.

257
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:42,880
She is expected to address
the attack on the white house

258
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,661
That ended an hour ago
in a startling rescue.

259
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:47,130
Now,based on the
few details we have,

260
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,641
We do know the rescue
resulted in the death

261
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,372
Of general juma and
all of his forces.

262
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:55,383
Angela,how much lead time
does the media need,

263
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:57,611
Once I'm finished
with my revisions?

264
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,913
The major outlets will
put us on immediately.

265
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,222
I'll be done shortly.

266
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,683
Thank you,angela.

267
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:07,763
I have a thought

268
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:10,010
About the speech,if
you'd like to hear it.

269
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,092
Of course.

270
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,731
Right now your main
thrust is reassurance.

271
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:15,662
The attacks are behind us,

272
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,501
Everything's going to
be back to normal.

273
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,531
But I think you're missing
an opportunity here.

274
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,302
To do what?

275
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,040
Claim victory.

276
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:24,941
To say that juma's
death means standing up

277
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,013
To tyranny works,and
that your decision

278
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,442
To send troops into
sangala was the right one.

279
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:31,381
I'm not sure that this is

280
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,450
The appropriate time to
sound triumphant,livy.

281
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,920
A lot of lives were lost today.

282
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:39,021
And by addressing those
deaths,you give them meaning.

283
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,891
Those people are heroes

284
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:42,742
Who died in a war that
was worth fighting.

285
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,732
Let's work it in.

286
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:53,973
Come in.

287
00:12:57,446 --> 00:13:00,170
Madam president,i have
some troubling news.

288
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,980
May i speak with you alone?

289
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:04,250
You my speak freely
in front of olivia.

290
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,252
Just after the attack
on the white house,

291
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,690
Jack bauer came forward

292
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,293
With a disturbing claim.

293
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:15,990
He said there were people

294
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,862
Still at large who were
involved in the conspiracy--

295
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:21,462
Persons unknown
who had helped juma

296
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,301
Plan and execute the attacks.

297
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:25,703
Did bauer have any
evidence of this?

298
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,300
Nothing concrete.

299
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:29,842
But he promoted the
notion that ryan burnett

300
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,411
Was our best chance of
identifying these people,

301
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,243
And bauer asked to be
allowed to question him.

302
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:39,350
This was supposed to be
a controlled situation.

303
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:43,881
A ploy to intimidate burnett
into giving up intel.

304
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,620
So,I granted bauer's request.

305
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,891
It was a terrible mistake.

306
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,231
What happened,ethan?

307
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:55,931
Burnett is dead.

308
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:57,700
My god...

309
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:59,270
The evidence suggests

310
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,702
That he was killed by bauer.

311
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,503
I don't believe it!

312
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:06,611
His claim of another party
being involved in the attacks

313
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,610
Appear to have been
a fabrication.

314
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,010
A fabrication.

315
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,583
It may have something to do
with bill buchanan's death;

316
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:13,911
No one knows.

317
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,282
But madam president,

318
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,681
I take full responsibility.

319
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,092
I was trying to insulate you.

320
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:21,462
To provide you with deniability

321
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,422
In case anything went wrong.

322
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,872
Or was it because you thought
the president would say no?

323
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,931
Olivia.

324
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:32,300
Where is bauer now?

325
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:33,830
At large.

326
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,873
The fbi is devoting its full
resources to the manhunt.

327
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,810
Let me know the
minute they find him.

328
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:41,580
Yes,ma'am.

329
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:46,182
Madam president...

330
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,952
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,930
Looks like everything.

332
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:14,141
She's on the move.

333
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:23,850
Where's bauer?

334
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:25,090
I don't know.

335
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,121
Don't you lie to me.

336
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,662
We traced two calls
from your cell

337
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,413
To a phone that was
reported stolen.

338
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:32,290
And we know you accessed a
classified government database

339
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,961
And sent someone's name
and address to bauer.

340
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:38,170
Renee,that makes you an
accessory after the fact.

341
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,372
Now tell me where he is.

342
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:41,970
I can't.

343
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,442
Damn it!

344
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,343
I still don't believe
that he did this.

345
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,563
Then explain to me why he's
not turning himself in,

346
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:50,032
And letting us help him find
this mysterious third party.

347
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,600
Because he was framed
and he doesn't trust

348
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,963
Our ability to work through it.

349
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,543
And,you know,after what
we've put him through,

350
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:55,651
How can you blame him?

351
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:00,623
You're actually willing To
sacrifice everything to protect him.

352
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:05,531
Once jack finds the
evidence,he will call us.

353
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:09,031
You know,janis is
decrpyting what you sent.

354
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:11,033
It's not going to
take her a long time.

355
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:12,501
We are going to find him.

356
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:15,200
Renee,tell me whose
information you sent.

357
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:17,471
I'll let the A.G.
know that you're cooperating.

358
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:20,542
I'm sorry,larry.

359
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:24,211
Put her in holding.

360
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:26,910
Mirandize her.

361
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,200
Good night,sir.

362
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,702
See you in the morning.

363
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:41,593
Hello?

364
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,222
Keep your hands where
i can see them,senator.

365
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,930
Bauer.

366
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,030
Take a seat.

367
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:01,282
I know what you did
to ryan burnett.

368
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:04,012
I'm not going to let you
butcher me like you did him.

369
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,282
You want me dead,bauer,

370
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,010
You'll have to kill
me where i stand.

371
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:09,483
If i wanted to
kill you,senator,

372
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,482
You'd be dead already.

373
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,052
Now take a seat!

374
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,703
You're a real enigma,bauer.

375
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:27,800
An hour after you save the
president from terrorists,

376
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:30,302
You murder a federal
witness in cold blood.

377
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,140
I didn't kill burnett.

378
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:33,511
This man did.

379
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,011
Do you know who he is?

380
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,113
No.

381
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,210
His name is john quinn.

382
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:39,280
He works for starkwood.

383
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:42,122
What in the world does
starkwood have to do with this?

384
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:43,281
I don't know yet.

385
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,340
But i do know they sent
someone to kill burnett

386
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:46,861
And frame me to cover
up their involvement

387
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,083
In everything that's
happened today,

388
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:49,920
Including the attack
on the white house.

389
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,860
That's a hell of
a theory,bauer.

390
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:56,230
But you'll have to spin
a better story than that

391
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,060
If you expect it to
get you off the hook.

392
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,102
Senator,i did not come
here to clear my name.

393
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,843
I'm trying to understand

394
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,001
The connection between
juma and starkwood.

395
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:06,043
There isn't one.

396
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,680
I've spent the better
part of six months

397
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,652
Investigating starkwood.

398
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:13,772
If there was a connection
to juma or sangala,

399
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:14,720
I would know it.

400
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,381
I want to see
every file you have

401
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:18,050
Concerning that investigation.

402
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,953
Look...

403
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,131
Starkwood has let their
security teams run amok

404
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,433
All over the world,with
no oversight.

405
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,652
They've bribed their way
into large contracts,

406
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,502
They've tried to
influence foreign policy

407
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:34,901
To their own benefit--
all good reasons

408
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,870
Why this country should
not be outsourcing

409
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:41,073
Its military operations
to private corporations.

410
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:45,113
And i am going to
shut them down.

411
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:48,551
But there is nothing
to remotely suggest

412
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:51,952
They'd be involved in terrorist
attacks on their own country

413
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:53,822
For any amount of money.

414
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:56,392
Maybe they have different
reasons for helping juma.

415
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,991
Like what?

416
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,491
I don't know.

417
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,733
Sir,i believe this country
is still under attack,

418
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:03,260
And there has to be a reason.

419
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:07,232
And i'm supposed to believe this, Coming
from a man who's holding me hostage?

420
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:11,141
I need access to those files.

421
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,682
And if the connection

422
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:17,751
Between juma and
starkwood isn't there,

423
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,910
Will you turn yourself in,then?

424
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,392
Just open the files,sir.

425
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,370
Ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:47,312
The president will be making
a brief statement tonight.

427
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:49,813
Good luck,mom.

428
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,711
I'm sure you'll understand,

429
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:53,582
Based on the events of today,

430
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:56,282
There will be no opportunity
for follow-up questions.

431
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,651
Ladies and gentlemen,

432
00:20:57,828 --> 00:21:00,792
The president of
the united states.

433
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,233
Thank you very much.

434
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:14,931
Thank you.

435
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,202
Thank you.

436
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:25,142
My fellow americans,john adams,

437
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:28,481
The first president to take up
residence in the white house,

438
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:30,722
Once prayed for
heaven to bestow

439
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,720
Its blessings on this place.

440
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:36,153
Tonight,those blessings
have seen us through

441
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,890
A brutal attack by
a desperate tyrant.

442
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,903
We have lost friends
and loved ones here,

443
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:45,601
But we have prevailed.

444
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:48,001
I have commanded law
enforcement agencies,

445
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:49,671
Emergency services
and first responders

446
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,433
To keep their
deployment level...

447
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:52,673
Mr. kanin,ken dellao,cnb.

448
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,970
I'm wondering if you can
confirm some information

449
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:56,470
I received a short time ago?

450
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,182
Ken,this is clearly
not the time...

451
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:01,712
Yeah,i'm,i'm going to be Reporting
in this evening's broadcast

452
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,781
That a rogue ex-federal
agent named jack bauer

453
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:07,592
Is the prime suspect in
the murder of ryan burnett.

454
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:10,361
...cannot forget
today's events.

455
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:11,523
The lives we lost...

456
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:12,821
Where did you get this?

457
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,760
So,it's true,then?

458
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:16,431
I'm not confirming anything.

459
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:19,933
I'll also be reporting That you
authorized bauer's release from custody

460
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:23,943
And arranged for his
access to the victim.

461
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:27,870
...daughters and
sons,brothers and sisters,

462
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,113
But they have not
taken our spirit.

463
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:32,952
Make no mistake,today's attacks

464
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,712
Were intended to
crush our resolve.

465
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,151
Mr. kanin.

466
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:38,622
I said no comment.

467
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:40,623
But america is not
so easily broken.

468
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:44,861
Our military action in
sangala has been a success.

469
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,341
At this hour,our forces

470
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:49,390
have taken control
of sangala city.

471
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,633
We have won.

472
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,470
I see you're back to
your old tactics.

473
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:55,172
What?

474
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:57,142
You leaked the story
of burnett's murder

475
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,671
And my involvement
to the press.

476
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:01,441
Ethan,i don't know what
you're talking about.

477
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:10,023
Olivia,don't bother denying it.

478
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:11,983
I can count on one hand
the number of people

479
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:14,421
Who knew i'd authorized
bauer's release.

480
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,690
So another one of
your errors in

481
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:18,761
judgment bites you have

482
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:22,290
And you think you can
lay the blame on me.

483
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,002
Do you realize
what you've done?

484
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:26,373
In trying to hurt me,

485
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:29,601
You'll have caused tremendous
damage to your mother.

486
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:32,103
The president has
gone on record

487
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:36,613
That torture is unacceptable
under any circumstances.

488
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:39,442
When this gets out,it will
look like bauer was sent

489
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:40,510
Exactly for that.

490
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,113
It'll be a political disaster.

491
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,681
You've gone too far this time.

492
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,181
I'm not listening
to you anymore.

493
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm not going to let
you get away with this.

494
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,253
Get your hands off me.

495
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,961
As americans,

496
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:54,661
We should stand together proud

497
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:55,893
Of what we have achieved.

498
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,662
Thanks to the efforts
and the sacrifices

499
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:04,540
Of so many,this
place,our national home,

500
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:07,412
Stands tall tonight.

501
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:11,380
And all our citizens can sleep
soundly with the knowledge

502
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:16,710
That the blessings of freedom
continue to shine upon us all.

503
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:19,851
No,there's been no sign of
bauer in the northeast sector,

504
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:22,520
So expand your cordon
to the 25-mile mark.

505
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:24,590
And be prepared
to back up metro.

506
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:27,291
I'm directing them to begin
random traffic stops,citywide.

507
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,793
Thank you.

508
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,322
I isolated the data
renee uploaded to bauer,

509
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,932
But i can't get past
the file header.

510
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:34,913
What does that mean?

511
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:37,193
She encrypted the name
and address she used,

512
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,771
And i can't seem to crack it.

513
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:41,143
You can't?
she used her personal computer.

514
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,543
This is very
serious encryption.

515
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:46,182
I mean,there are some high-level
people who can do it. like who?

516
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:47,812
Chloe o'brian--
but from what you've

517
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:49,380
told me,she's still
loyal to Bauer.

518
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:52,222
Is her husband still here?

519
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,521
Yeah. He's waiting to see you.

520
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:57,822
According to her file,he's
a level-six analyst,too.

521
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:59,181
Yeah. He's waiting to see me.

522
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,463
I have no idea how much
longer i'm going to be here.

523
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:04,201
Just do me a favor and
give prescott his babu

524
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:05,602
Before you put him down.

525
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:09,900
Yeah,i'm going to have
to call you back. yeah.

526
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:11,741
Mr. o'brian,i'm larry moss.

527
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:13,540
Yeah,i'd like to see my wife.

528
00:25:13,717 --> 00:25:15,871
All right.

529
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,421
What the bloody hell
are you holding her for?

530
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:28,321
Obstruction,evidence tampering.

531
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:30,262
I think you should be
more concerned about

532
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:32,361
What you can do to
get her out. sorry?

533
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,261
Help us find jack bauer.

534
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:38,102
Last i heard from chloe,jack
was working for the bureau.

535
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:39,563
That's you,if i'm not mistaken.

536
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,101
He was.

537
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:43,402
Until he snapped and
murdered a federal witness.

538
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:44,841
Really?

539
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:46,131
I find that hard to believe.

540
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:48,301
All that's relevant
here is that your wife

541
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,061
Is going to be prosecuted
for colluding with bauer,

542
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:51,581
Unless you help us find him.

543
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:53,151
Mr. o'brian,

544
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:54,480
A short time ago,

545
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:57,001
One of our agents was in
touch with jack bauer.

546
00:25:57,116 --> 00:25:59,022
She sent a name and address

547
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:00,751
That we assume is
his next destination.

548
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,593
Unfortunately,it's encrypted
with blowfish 148.

549
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,092
No one here knows
how to crack that.

550
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,131
Therefore,we need your help.

551
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:10,030
Please.

552
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:15,100
Jack bauer and my wife
have a very long history.

553
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:16,932
I consider him to be a friend.

554
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:18,601
And he'll have
his day in court.

555
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:20,042
But the case against your wife

556
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,072
Is rock solid.

557
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,410
I can't.

558
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:28,483
We're talking about her serving
a minimum sentence of 15 years.

559
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:31,822
Your son will be 19 by the
time she gets out of prison.

560
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:47,472
I want guarantees
of full immunity,

561
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:50,500
No jail time,expulsion of
all charges from her record.

562
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,600
You have my word.

563
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,343
You are a witness
to this agreement.

564
00:26:53,518 --> 00:26:54,342
Yes.

565
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:56,813
Show me the file.

566
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:57,942
Original information--

567
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,853
16- or 32-bit word
length? thirty-two.

568
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:04,053
Native or modified data points?

569
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,521
Native.

570
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:10,993
The designer of this algorithm

571
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:12,411
Built a backdoor into his code.

572
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,983
Decryption's a piece of cake if
you know the override codes.

573
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:16,131
And you do?

574
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:18,003
Yeah.

575
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,931
Will this take long?

576
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,803
Course not.

577
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,140
Mr. o'brian,can you
tell me specifically

578
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:29,311
When you'll have
the file decrypted?

579
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:31,510
Yes.

580
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:35,351
Now.

581
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:37,963
Your agent sent jack to

582
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,521
951 deerbrook
avenue,georgetown,

583
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:42,721
Residence of senator
blaine mayer.

584
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:44,692
Assemble the field teams.

585
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:47,991
Tell them we have a
probable location on bauer.

586
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,503
And get metro pd on the way.

587
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:06,503
No luck reaching
mayer on his cell

588
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:07,591
or at the house.

589
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:08,760
The phone company said

590
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:10,291
The line was
shorted out on-site.

591
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:11,291
Yeah,that's bauer.

592
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:12,312
Why is he doing this?

593
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:14,182
Because mayer spent
the last six months

594
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:16,352
Trying to send bauer to prison
for the rest of his life.

595
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:20,530
All right,metro pd is closing
in on mayer's residence.

596
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,953
I've authorized them to move in

597
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,930
As soon as they're in
position and at strength.

598
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:28,510
I told them,and i'm telling you,it
is impossible to overestimate bauer.

599
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:30,291
He has more training
and more experience

600
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:32,601
Than anybody in this room,and
that includes myself.

601
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:34,922
Okay,let's move.

602
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:37,370
Agent moss will be
running on-point tactical

603
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:38,753
with fbi teams on five.

604
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,290
All units must register and
log their com through me,

605
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:45,533
And i will distribute recognition
codes and credentials.

606
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,502
Chloe... i can't believe you.

607
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:52,072
You're helping them catch jack.

608
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:53,101
I did it for you.

609
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:55,460
This is the last thing
i would have wanted.

610
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:57,372
How could you do this?
let's see,for a start,

611
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:59,243
I thought it might be
nice to spare prescott

612
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:02,312
The inconvenience of having
a convict for a mother.

613
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:05,153
Jack saved your life.
i don't deny that i owe him.

614
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:09,950
But my child and my
marriage comes first,

615
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,253
And it should for you,too.

616
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,761
Chloe,love,you've helped
jack enough.

617
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:16,622
You have.

618
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:22,303
And you can't go deciding to
make this sacrifice on your own.

619
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:25,073
But he didn't do what
they're saying he did.

620
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,832
Then he can prove that when
they take him into custody.

621
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:30,670
If they give him the chance.

622
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:50,020
At the hearing this morning,you
said you had no regrets

623
00:29:50,197 --> 00:29:51,661
About what you've done.

624
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:55,631
But what i saw was a
man full of regret.

625
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:58,230
Of course i
have regrets,senator.

626
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:03,970
I regret losing my family.

627
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:06,972
My wife was murdered
because i was responsible

628
00:30:07,145 --> 00:30:12,083
For protecting david palmer
during an assassination attempt.

629
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:14,183
My daughter can't
even look at me.

630
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:17,321
Every day,i regret
looking into the eyes

631
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:19,150
Of men,women and children,

632
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:20,551
Knowing that,any moment,

633
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:22,690
Their lives might be
deemed expendable

634
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,691
In an effort to protect
the greater good.

635
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:29,530
I regret every decision or
mistake i might have made

636
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,400
That resulted in the loss
of a single innocent life.

637
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:36,573
But you know what
i regret the most?

638
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:40,340
Is that this world even
needs people like me.

639
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:43,643
So you think i'm
naive to believe

640
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:46,571
We need to hold ourselves to
a higher standard of combat?

641
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,981
Doesn't even matter
what i think,senator.

642
00:30:49,156 --> 00:30:51,272
You just need to
understand where i work,

643
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:54,053
Things get a lot messier than
where you work on the hill.

644
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:59,260
What you've lost,mr.
bauer,is tragic.

645
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:01,291
What you've been
compelled to do

646
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:04,933
In the name of saving
innocent life is tragic.

647
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:10,203
Sometimes we need to incur
the most horrible losses

648
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,413
In order to uphold the ideals

649
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:14,370
That this country
was founded on.

650
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:17,243
How can we presume
to lead the world

651
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,082
Unless we set an example?

652
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:23,750
You make it sound so simple.

653
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,693
Well,maybe it's
simpler than you think.

654
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:27,691
Maybe all the things
that you've seen

655
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:30,343
And all the things that you've
done have cloud of your vision.

656
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:36,702
Look at this.

657
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,273
Tell me about this
car accident.

658
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:43,373
That has nothing
to do with juma.

659
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:44,671
Who was the victim?

660
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:46,011
A source inside of starkwood.

661
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,372
A whistle-blower.

662
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:48,943
Unfortunately,he was
also a drunk.

663
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:50,530
He was killed when
he wrecked his car

664
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,471
On the way home
from atlantic city.

665
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,911
Blood alcohol off the charts.

666
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:01,590
Senator,this was no accident.

667
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,622
Your informant was
murdered by the same man

668
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:05,391
Who took ryan burnett
out this evening.

669
00:32:05,496 --> 00:32:06,693
What does this mean,bauer?

670
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,461
They were scared of
what he had to say.

671
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,590
What does your informant
have on starkwood?

672
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:11,920
He made a lot of
wild accusations,

673
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:13,873
But not a single one
of them panned out.

674
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,443
Maybe you didn't
dig deep enough.

675
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:17,542
Senator,i need to know
exactly what he told you.

676
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,613
He alleged that starkwood

677
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:21,271
Was blackmailing
pentagon officials.

678
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:23,642
That they were involved
in assassination plots.

679
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,253
Even that they were seeking
to acquire their own wmds.

680
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:27,582
Specifically what?

681
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:29,320
Well,i don't
remember,but i'm sure

682
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:31,322
That his interview
transcript should be there.

683
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,662
Okay,i got it.

684
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,921
Oh,my god.

685
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:38,861
That's it.

686
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:39,733
What?

687
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:41,481
Your informant claims
that starkwood

688
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,103
Was trying to
acquire a bioweapon.

689
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:44,603
That's your connection to juma.

690
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:45,533
I don't understand.

691
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,301
When juma was in
power,it was rumored

692
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,372
That he was running an
illegal weapons program.

693
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:51,142
He was developing a bioweapon,

694
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:52,441
But nobody could prove it.

695
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:54,110
But the people that
i knew in sangala

696
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:56,812
Believed he was testing these
weapons on his own population.

697
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,082
He used a remote village,

698
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,510
Released some kind of pathogen.

699
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,753
Everyone there was
struck with dementia,

700
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:04,020
Paralysis and eventually died.

701
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:05,161
Why wasn't this pursued?

702
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:07,143
'cause juma destroyed
all the evidence.

703
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,580
He firebombed the
village before anyone

704
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:10,220
Could get there,and
un officials

705
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:12,693
Had a hard time believing
that juma had the technology

706
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,833
Or expertise to
develop such a weapon.

707
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,460
But starkwood... they had both.

708
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:19,570
The technology
and the expertise.

709
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,770
And what did juma have
to offer starkwood?

710
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:23,703
A safe haven to
develop the weapon

711
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,512
And an endless supply of
victims to test it on.

712
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:29,843
Even if all this was
true,why in the world

713
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:32,112
Would starkwood
want a bioweapon?

714
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:34,881
Senator,you've been trying
to dismantle starkwood

715
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,522
For the last six months.

716
00:33:36,688 --> 00:33:38,550
Maybe they planned
on fighting back.

717
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,653
But regardless,if they
have a weapon like this,

718
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:43,321
You better believe
they intend to use it.

719
00:33:44,837 --> 00:33:45,830
Senator mayer!

720
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:46,831
This is metro pd!

721
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:49,002
Don't you move.

722
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:55,273
Hold on. hold on!

723
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:58,101
You're obviously
on to something.

724
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:59,443
They can help you

725
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:01,640
Find the evidence you
need to prove your case.

726
00:34:01,816 --> 00:34:04,040
Right now everyone thinks
i killed ryan burnett.

727
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:06,282
- No one's gonna listen to me.
- i can protect you.

728
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:07,511
I can order them to help us.

729
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,113
Starkwood infiltrated
the white house.

730
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:11,151
As soon as they find out
you're going after them

731
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:13,113
For a bioweapon,they'll
bury the evidence.

732
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,860
Then we'll keep
the circle small.

733
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:17,793
I can make this happen.

734
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:20,263
It's time for you to start
trusting the institutions

735
00:34:20,436 --> 00:34:23,762
That you've sacrificed
so much to protect.

736
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,770
Trust isn't my greatest asset.

737
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:28,542
Son,you have to
start somewhere.

738
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:31,572
Senator!

739
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,313
This is metro pd!

740
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:35,510
You really think
you can do this?

741
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:37,480
I know i can.

742
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:41,451
Let 'em in.

743
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:46,250
Coming!

744
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:56,660
No!

745
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:54,660
You wanted to see me?

746
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,262
Yes,livy.

747
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:00,620
Ethan just come to me with
something very disturbing.

748
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:03,572
I assume it's about the press
leak regarding jack bauer.

749
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:08,113
Ethan seems to think you
had something to do with it.

750
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:09,513
I didn't.

751
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:11,211
I already told him that.

752
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:12,883
Well,given the past experience

753
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:15,212
Between the two of
you,he's not convinced.

754
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:17,380
And what do you think?

755
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,293
I think i need to hear
what you have to say.

756
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:22,222
There's nothing she can
say,madam president.

757
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:24,060
She was one of the few people

758
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:25,621
Who knew all the details.

759
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:28,561
More people knew
than you think.

760
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,520
I just got off
the phone with the

761
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,130
white house secretary producer

762
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,302
At cnb.

763
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:34,902
He won't give me
the source's name,

764
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:36,232
But he's willing to confirm

765
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:38,400
That the leak came from
someone inside the federal

766
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:39,771
Marshal's office.

767
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:42,310
He'll guarantee it didn't
come from the white house,

768
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:43,882
Or from me.

769
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:47,283
This is verifiable?

770
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,980
Producer's name is
charlie isakson.

771
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:52,680
Here's his number.

772
00:36:52,855 --> 00:36:54,622
You can call him
yourself if you'd like.

773
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:03,051
I offered isakson some

774
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:05,292
Exclusive time with you
if he killed the story,

775
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:07,001
And he agreed.

776
00:37:07,178 --> 00:37:09,001
So as long as we get
bauer in custody,

777
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:11,170
We should be able to keep
the fallout contained.

778
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,110
Ethan,under the circumstances,

779
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:16,010
I think it seems clear

780
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,182
That you were mistaken.

781
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,481
I'm satisfied.

782
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:22,651
Are you?

783
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,122
Yes,madam president.

784
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,621
I'm sorry,olivia,

785
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:28,520
If i misjudged

786
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,220
The situation...

787
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:31,693
And you.

788
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,131
I want to know

789
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:36,463
If the fbi's any closer
to finding bauer.

790
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:38,061
Yes,ma'am.

791
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:40,530
That's all.

792
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:50,582
I'm sorry

793
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,313
- I put you on the spot like that.
- i understand.

794
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,310
Ethan didn't give
you much of a choice.

795
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:56,512
I just hope

796
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:59,281
They find bauer before
this gets any worse.

797
00:41:17,787 --> 00:41:19,283
You're dying.

798
00:41:19,455 --> 00:41:20,921
Just tell me where

799
00:41:21,098 --> 00:41:23,190
The weapons are coming in.

800
00:41:23,368 --> 00:41:25,362
When are they getting here?

801
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,191
They're already here.

802
00:42:04,406 --> 00:42:05,903
Janis,it's larry.

803
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,802
We got here too late.

804
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:09,632
Bauer murdered senator mayer.

805
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:12,270
Escalate the search
for him to region-wide.

806
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,411
I want reinforcements
from every branch
