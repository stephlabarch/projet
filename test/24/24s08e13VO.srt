3
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,432
You know him, don't you?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,820
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle
of a national security crisis.

5
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,524
I have to go back to my desk.

6
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:24,056
Okay, perhaps if I talk
to your supervisor,

7
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,192
he could let you
take a few minutes off.

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,486
It's over.

9
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,530
The parole officer
looking for Kevin is here.

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,113
He's after the raw feed.
I'm gonna give it to him.

11
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:36,522
- Why don't you wait?
- Do you hear me?

12
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,038
He knows everything,
he'll go to Hastings.

13
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,870
Do what he says
and you won't get hurt.

14
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,295
Who is he?
Another traitor?

15
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,914
The only traitor...

16
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:50,465
is your father.

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,636
We haven't disabled
the detectors yet.

18
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:56,681
- Where are the rods?
- They're still outside the city.

19
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,350
- How will you bring them to me?
- It's been taken care of.

20
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:01,052
Let's go!

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,354
Stop them!

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,490
You better take this, it's Kayla Hassan!
She's in a car, she's escaped.

23
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,076
They tried to kill me,
but Tarin got me out.

24
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:18,552
They shot him.

25
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:20,943
He told me to call CTU!

26
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,452
Ms. Hassan, my name is Jack Bauer.

27
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:25,804
We need to know
where you were being held.

28
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:27,503
We got the location.

29
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,825
Targets are heading north
on Orchard.

30
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:31,507
They're getting into an SUV.

31
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,818
We ID'd one of the targets
as Tarin Faroush.

32
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:36,269
Kayla said he sacrificed himself,
but he's still alive.

33
00:01:36,394 --> 00:01:38,389
The car that Tarin got into,
where is it now?

34
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,933
Taking the first exit
of the Williamsburg Bridge.

35
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,605
- You've gotta put Hastings on now.
- I'm on.

36
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,771
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.

37
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,307
They faked her escape.
They wanted to get her to CTU.

38
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,234
- She's in the tunnel.
- Stop the car!

39
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,504
Put your hands up!

40
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:53,738
It's an EMP!

41
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:00,661
What's happening?

42
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,075
Contact NSA.

43
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,358
Terrorists just took out CTU.

44
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:34,182
Central comm node is totally fried.

45
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:36,341
- Reroute to peripherals.
- I already tried.

46
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:37,404
Try again.

47
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:39,319
I can't have
the status on the drones.

48
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,002
- Everything's down.
- So?

49
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,001
- That they're going to crash?
- Not yet.

50
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:45,252
The NAV systems
should default to autopilot.

51
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:47,500
They'll circle
until they run out of gas.

52
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,836
But we've lost all aerial surveillance
and radiological detection.

53
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:52,306
Basically.

54
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:54,797
All right.

55
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:56,947
Agent Skaggs
is heading outside on foot.

56
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,595
Have him contact FAA
with the drones default flight paths.

57
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:02,723
They need to be taken down
before they crash on the city.

58
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,291
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,132
You okay?

60
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:12,403
Am I okay?

61
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,327
An EMP just took us out of play
and we're dropping the ball

62
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:17,258
on a radiological threat
against New York.

63
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:18,516
So, no, Chloe,

64
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:19,782
I am not okay.

65
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:22,218
And I won't be
until we find those rods.

66
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:24,537
Sir, Kayla Hassan
is finished in Medical.

67
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,665
I need her taken back to the UN
so she can be evacuated.

68
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,575
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

69
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,045
I need you to assemble division heads.
We have a briefing in 10 minutes.

70
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,090
Tell them to come
with full damage reports.

71
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,135
Their systems are down.
They can't generate reports.

72
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,429
Then tell them to use a pen
and a legal pad.

73
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:51,230
- Phil Holden.
- <i>It's Jack Bauer.</i>

74
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,858
So you're back in play.

75
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,522
I don't have a lot of time,
Listen to me carefully.

76
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,463
There's an IRK cell trying to smuggle
weapons-grade uranium into the city.

77
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,575
I just read the assessment.

78
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,832
It says you've got
a CTU team tracking them.

79
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:06,171
Yes, but we lost them.

80
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,974
CTU just got hit
by some electromagnetic pulse device,

81
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,026
wiped out all our visual incom.

82
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,486
I want you
to try and locate our hostiles.

83
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:16,022
We don't have any birds
over the metro area.

84
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,191
<i>All aerial surveillance
was being routed through CTU.</i>

85
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:20,993
And the traffic cams?

86
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,399
I can try.

87
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,014
The hostiles last location?

88
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,177
The West Broadway/
Roebling Street exit.

89
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,560
They're in a gray SUV.

90
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,687
I'll call you if we get a hit.

91
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,747
I also need you to shut down
all bridge and tunnel traffic.

92
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:36,272
- <i>Done.</i>
- Thanks.

93
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,968
- Where are you going?
- NSA's shutting all the traffic.

94
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:45,918
There's only one way
for them to get in.

95
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:47,795
Across the East River.

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,070
That's right.

97
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:16,465
- CTU is down.
- You have confirmation?

98
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:19,549
I have a real-time uplink
to the power grid.

99
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,446
It recorded a pulse surge
and now nothing.

100
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,126
CTU is blind, deaf, and dumb.

101
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:27,616
- Have you secured this area?
- Yes.

102
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,919
- You've done well.
- Thank you.

103
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:38,504
Load the rods.

104
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,450
I realize
this was very difficult for you.

105
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:56,372
But Hassan's daughter
was a necessary sacrifice.

106
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,694
Using her was the only way for us
to get the rods into the city.

107
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,849
Agents Beck and Henderson
will escort you back to the UN.

108
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:25,250
Tell me what's going on.

109
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:27,153
Agent Beck will brief you.

110
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,148
Once you're there, we'll need you.

111
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:31,046
Your father gave us a file

112
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,146
of IRK covert agents
operating in this country.

113
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:37,562
We need you to identify
the men working with Tarin.

114
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,553
I'm not doing anything
until you tell me what's happening.

115
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:48,855
The car you drove here was rigged
with an EMP device.

116
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,478
It's a pulse weapon
designed to disarm electronics.

117
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,289
It's crashed all our systems.

118
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,169
I don't understand.

119
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,084
Tarin put me in that car.

120
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:00,792
He used you.

121
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:03,155
He staged your escape,

122
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,535
put you in that car,
and sent you back here.

123
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:08,260
But he was shot.

124
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
I saw him.

125
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,455
He is alive.

126
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,107
We spotted him a few minutes ago.

127
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,354
It's a lot to take in,
but you need to go with these agents

128
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,940
back to the UN
and start looking through those files.

129
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:24,615
You've seen these terrorists.

130
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,445
If you can help us,

131
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,074
we stand a chance of finding them
before they carry out their attack.

132
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,365
Ahman has prepared the bomb.

133
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,159
It'll be short work

134
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,211
once we get the rods
across the river.

135
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,539
<i>A vehicle is coming.</i>

136
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,763
- <i>Where is it?</i>
- It's coming from the east.

137
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:00,127
Black SUV, no markings.

138
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,693
- How many men have you got?
- Three.

139
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,628
Wait until the SUV's in the range,

140
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,117
then take them out.

141
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,331
Let's go!

142
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:39,885
- Hold on.
- What is it?

143
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:41,562
Thought I caught something.

144
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,890
Heat source down by the water.

145
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:46,410
- Now it's gone.
- See if NYPD can get some units here.

146
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:49,852
I'll contact NSA, see if they've got
surveillance of the area.

147
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,572
That's weird.

148
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:02,748
I got four bars,
but the call's not going through.

149
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:03,923
Me neither.

150
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:11,182
We're being jammed.
They're here. Damn it!

151
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,638
Get down now!

152
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,368
Come on!

153
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,559
The engine's down.
Pass your weapons up front!

154
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,294
Take the sniper to your north.
Maintain coverage until we're clear.

155
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,839
Get ready to unload all the weapons
from the back, you ready?

156
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,268
How did they know
where to look for us?

157
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:08,774
They must have followed us.

158
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:13,695
Use your infrared!
Call out the snipers as you see them!

159
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:21,356
Ten o'clock, high and low!

160
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,625
I'm counting four men.

161
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,585
I recognize one from the hospital.

162
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,337
He was the one that talked Marcos

163
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,005
out of detonating the vest.

164
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,259
It's Jack Bauer.

165
00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:38,553
Ex-CTU.
He was one of their best agents.

166
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:42,766
Nine o'clock low!

167
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:50,995
We can still cross with the rods.

168
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:56,071
As long as we're certain Bauer
and his men cannot warn anyone.

169
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:57,406
It's not a risk.

170
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,936
We started jamming their comm
as soon as they were in sight.

171
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,592
Now they can't leave.

172
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,598
Not with the snipers in position.

173
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:08,468
Good.

174
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,236
Make sure none of them
get out alive.

175
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,102
I'll call you
when we're across the river.

176
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,411
Let's move.

177
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,192
Reloading!

178
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,408
I've got two men,
leaving the dock in a boat.

179
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,492
Tarin's in it.

180
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:45,495
They're carrying a box
the right size and shape for the rods.

181
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,663
Copy that!

182
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,730
Went out of my range. We got to notify
NYPD before they cross the river.

183
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:58,300
I tried cell and radio frequencies.
They're all jammed.

184
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:03,055
There's a call box
mounted on the building. Ten o'clock.

185
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:08,769
It's gotta be a hard line.
We can call from there.

186
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,938
How do we get there?
The shooters will pick us off

187
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,687
one by one as soon as we step out
from behind the vehicle.

188
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,693
Our vehicle's armored.

189
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,362
We can use the panels for coverage.

190
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,156
Start now!

191
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:37,104
Casualty reports are also coming in.

192
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:40,268
Three fatalities from the bomb blast
in the motor pool tunnel.

193
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:42,902
- What else?
- Minor injuries for the most part.

194
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,541
Agent McCallan was burned
in a small electrical fire.

195
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,224
- How is he?
- He'll be okay.

196
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,560
But with our infirmary down we had
to transport him to the local hospital.

197
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,605
- Says here we have flooding.
- The pumps are down,

198
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,608
and certain sections of the basement
have about six inches of water.

199
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,610
Can you stop it
or are we all going to drown?

200
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,482
The repair crew's working on it.

201
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,239
Give me an update in 20 minutes.

202
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:04,936
- Excuse me, sir?
- What is it?

203
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,118
The NSA is here.

204
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,702
NSA?

205
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:23,176
Brian Hastings, director of CTU.

206
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,345
Frank Haynam, senior engineer

207
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,844
at the New York field office.

208
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,382
- You've been hit by an EMP?
- That's right.

209
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,685
I hope you're here to help
because we can use it.

210
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,146
We are indeed.
Brought my best men with me.

211
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:37,740
We'd start by restoring your aerial
surveillance and communications.

212
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,830
- Where's your server room?
- Downstairs.

213
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:43,321
I'll let my team know you're here.
You boys can put your heads together.

214
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,031
I prefer to work with my own people.

215
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:48,994
There's no one more familiar
with this facility than my crew.

216
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,705
Not exactly true.

217
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,200
I was part of the group
that helped design this place.

218
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:55,892
Can't say I'm thrilled
with what you've done with it.

219
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,504
How did you find out we were hit?

220
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,966
Jack Bauer called our regional HQ.
Told us your situation.

221
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,708
Bauer was pursuing the men
behind this attack

222
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,016
when we lost contact.

223
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,658
Do you know where he is?

224
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,622
NSA's been trying to call him back.

225
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,809
He's not answering.
They're not sure why.

226
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:15,896
Right this way.

227
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:30,664
We should be reporting damages.
What are you doing?

228
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,213
There may be a way to tap in,
get some of our systems running.

229
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,080
How?

230
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,708
I haven't figured it out yet,
and I won't if you keep talking.

231
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:38,660
All right, people, listen up.

232
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,540
This is Frank Haynam,

233
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:48,805
senior engineer
of the NSA's New York field office.

234
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,181
Now, he and his team
are going to help us restore

235
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,266
aerial surveillance
and communications.

236
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,353
So we can get back
to tracking the nuclear rods.

237
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:59,940
They also brought along
a fresh batch of cell phones.

238
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:03,485
Give them your full cooperation.
Whatever they need, make it happen.

239
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,238
Now, we have been knocked down,
but I promise you,

240
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:08,490
we are going to get back up.

241
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,402
Let's get to work.

242
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,160
Agent Blochard,

243
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,746
can you get them
down to the server room?

244
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,039
Has NSA heard from Jack?

245
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:22,796
They spoke with him 20 minutes ago,
but there hasn't been any contact since.

246
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,794
- Why not?
- They don't know.

247
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,370
He could be in some kind of trouble.
Send men out looking for him.

248
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:30,143
Even if I had agents available,
I wouldn't know where to send them.

249
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:33,807
He was heading toward the East River.
That's 4 square miles of Real Estate...

250
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,551
too much for me to commit resources
that we don't have.

251
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:40,438
He was pursuing the terrorists.
He's our best chance.

252
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,316
We'll focus on our efforts here.
When everything's back,

253
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,360
- we'll find them.
- It might be too late.

254
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,644
If anyone can take care of themselves,
it's Jack.

255
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,742
Now, go to the server room,
make sure Haynam has all he needs.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,566
Worse than I thought.
90% of these components are fried.

257
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:08,820
We're going to have to swap them out
and install new server boards.

258
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:13,597
Mr. Haynam.

259
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,721
Chloe O'Brian. Mr. Hastings wanted me
to make sure you have all you need.

260
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,647
We're fine, Ms. O'Brian. Thank you.

261
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,442
You'll use the CLR processor?

262
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,612
We'll isolate it from the main servers
and create a brand-new subnet.

263
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:32,449
Creating a brand-new subnet
from scratch? That'll take forever.

264
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,869
Thanks for offering your help.
We'll take it from here.

265
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:38,947
I think there's another way.
I've been looking at the schematics.

266
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,875
- Tap directly into the trunk line.
- I'm not that insane.

267
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,253
We need to make sure
those nuclear rods

268
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,671
don't get into the city.

269
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:50,550
- My suggestion will be a lot faster.
- Or make things a whole lot worse.

270
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:52,427
How?

271
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,722
Reopen that without system buffers,
you could cause an overload,

272
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,849
wind up electrocuting yourself,

273
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,143
not to mention starting a fire.

274
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,937
I'm aware of the risks.
I think I can create a workaround.

275
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,337
You couldn't keep an EMP
from taking out your operation.

276
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,430
Forgive me if I don't bow
to your expertise.

277
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:11,154
If you'd stop with the insults
and just listen to me.

278
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,740
I'm not here to brainstorm.
But to clean up your mess.

279
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:16,076
You need to leave.
Now.

280
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:19,663
I said now, Ms. O'Brian.
I won't ask you again.

281
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,048
Start prepping the CLR
for a diagnostic.

282
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,017
Is there any other way to get into
the trunk line besides the server room?

283
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,269
That's the only way in. Why?

284
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,566
I think I have a faster way
to get us back online,

285
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,358
but Haynam says it's too dangerous.

286
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,721
I think he's a raging egomaniac.

287
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:53,738
Seems to be a prerequisite
for engineers these days.

288
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:56,083
You talk to Hastings?

289
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,826
He'll just shoot me down.

290
00:17:58,186 --> 00:17:59,137
Maybe not.

291
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:01,256
And maybe the moon will fall
from the sky.

292
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,124
Just let it go. These NSA guys
seem to know what they're doing.

293
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:07,585
- And if they don't, what about Jack?
- What's Jack got to do with this?

294
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,629
Never mind.

295
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,934
- Hello?
- <i>Renee, it's Chloe. Where are you?</i>

296
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,270
At Jack's apartment.
What's going on?

297
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,286
Everything. CTU was hit by an EMP.

298
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,448
All of our systems are down.
It's a real mess.

299
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:32,986
- How did that happen?
- I can't go into it right now,

300
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,202
but we think the terrorists were trying
to take out our radiological detectors.

301
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:39,784
- Where's Jack?
- He might be in some kind of trouble.

302
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,787
Slow down, Chloe.
What do you mean?

303
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,181
Jack was tracking the terrorists
when the EMP hit.

304
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:47,587
He called NSA
and they lost contact, too.

305
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:50,996
- Does Hastings know about this?
- He's the one who told me.

306
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:53,157
What's he doing about it?
Nothing.

307
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,203
He won't send anyone out
to look for them.

308
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:58,011
He says he can't spare the men
and that Jack can take care of himself.

309
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,987
Where was Jack
before you lost contact?

310
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:03,606
He took the first exit
off the Williamsburg Bridge.

311
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:06,679
I'm going to try to find him.
Get CTU back online ASAP.

312
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:07,979
Get Jack's position,

313
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,648
- <i>and direct me to him.</i>
- That might take a while.

314
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,773
NSA brought in a repair team
and they're going about it all wrong.

315
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:15,789
I have a faster way
to get us back online.

316
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:17,064
Tell them.

317
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,743
I tried. They won't listen.

318
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:21,242
Then make them listen.
Do what you have to do.

319
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,514
Okay. I will.

320
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,390
<i>Call me when you're back up.</i>

321
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,676
The EMP took out all of our systems.

322
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:54,682
And since we don't know
how long it's going to be,

323
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:57,200
we'll to have to evacuate
all nonessential personnel.

324
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,326
Follow Agent Combs
through our access tunnel.

325
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:01,199
I need to speak with Mr. Prady.

326
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:02,700
Thank you.

327
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:04,322
Please.

328
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:12,877
I'm really sorry
it took me so long to get back to you.

329
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,322
I've been busy.

330
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,215
They briefed me on what happened.
It's a terrible thing.

331
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,446
And I have some bad news
because of it.

332
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,221
The video that you wanted

333
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,289
has been erased by the EMP.

334
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:28,434
Erased?

335
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,687
Everything in the building
has been fried.

336
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,189
That's a damn shame.

337
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,860
So what you're telling me
is whoever helped Kevin Wade

338
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,279
rob that evidence locker...
they just caught a huge break.

339
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:40,857
I'm afraid so.

340
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,492
Are you sure that it was all erased,
Ms. Walsh?

341
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,063
- Don't you have a backup system?
- Yes, yes, we do, but it's on-site.

342
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:50,373
All the servers
have been wiped clean.

343
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:54,252
I know how much Kevin means to you.

344
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:56,902
I really wish I could do more.

345
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:00,258
So you're sure
there's nothing else you can tell me?

346
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,225
Anything that would
help me find Kevin?

347
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,970
I have told you everything I know.

348
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,765
I'm sure you have.

349
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,017
I really have to go.

350
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,478
Good luck finding Kevin.
I hope that he's okay.

351
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:14,154
Me, too.

352
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:16,524
If anything changes
with those files,

353
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,192
I'll be in Little Rock. Call me.

354
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,485
Of course.

355
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:23,254
I hope you get your lights back on.

356
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:02,904
I think I found a way to deal
with the safety concerns about my idea.

357
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,672
Here's the workaround.

358
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,701
I thought I made myself clear.
We'll nowhere near that trunk line.

359
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:15,367
I'm going to ask you one last time.
We really need to do this my way.

360
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:19,254
We have agents closed to finding
the nuclear rods, they need our help.

361
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,714
And I'll ask you one last time.
Get out of here.

362
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:24,453
Get out or I'll call security!

363
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:28,555
You get out.

364
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,266
Now.
All of you, get out now.

365
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:35,024
Take a second to think.

366
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:37,481
Do you really want to do this?

367
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,066
Mr. Haynam,
I don't want to hurt you.

368
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:43,085
You're probably an okay guy
when you're not at work.

369
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,946
And you're wearing a wedding ring.

370
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,442
I swear to God,
if you don't leave right now,

371
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,075
I will shoot you.

372
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,120
Get out!

373
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:54,826
Go!

374
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:11,944
Go get Hastings
and tell him to bring security.

375
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:32,118
They're starting to flank us!

376
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:34,038
We're almost there!

377
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:40,084
- They're almost on us. We gotta leave.
- Just give me one more second.

378
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,657
Okay, I'm ready.

379
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,676
We'll use these plates to form a way
so we can make it over to the call box.

380
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:51,304
Remember, we need to move
slow and steady.

381
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,181
We must stick together.

382
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,807
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

383
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:56,684
Bear the shooting,

384
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,145
this armor is gonna protect us.
Trust that.

385
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,566
Cole, you're with Agent King.
Owen, you're with me.

386
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,056
Let's go!

387
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:29,502
- The armor's not gonna hold up.
- Yes, it is.

388
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,968
Maintain formation.

389
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:39,242
- Can you get a shot?
- Not from this angle.

390
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,589
- It's not holding up.
- Yes, it is. Slow down!

391
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:48,759
We're almost there. Move!

392
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,264
Forget him for now.

393
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,142
- We can't just leave him there.
- We don't leave our men behind.

394
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,199
You try and bring him in, you're dead.
They're trying to draw us out.

395
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:25,022
Best thing we can do is make it
to the hard line and call for help.

396
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,943
We're almost there.

397
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,070
You cover the north, Owen the east.

398
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:32,447
I can get there.

399
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,835
Cover him!

400
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:24,123
I'm sorry.
I couldn't leave him behind.

401
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:25,458
You did great.

402
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,965
Is he all right?
Did he make it?

403
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:38,137
Did he make it?!

404
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:40,014
He made it.

405
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:43,896
Come on. Stay with me.

406
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:45,436
Jack, they're repositioning.

407
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:47,018
Stay on them.

408
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:15,318
Are you all right?

409
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,260
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm okay.

410
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:24,642
I'm so sorry.

411
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:28,734
I'm so sorry.

412
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,608
You were right about Tarin.

413
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:39,031
I should have listened to you.

414
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:40,617
You are safe.

415
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:42,910
That's what's important.

416
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:48,207
CTU is preparing
a subterranean evacuation route.

417
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,917
If there is a radiological attack,

418
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:51,820
you'll be shielded underground.

419
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:54,131
- When do we leave?
- As soon as possible.

420
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,750
President Taylor's waiting for you
with the other delegates.

421
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:59,510
The files Mr. Hastings request
are inside.

422
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,469
Thank you.

423
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,192
Go with them.

424
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:16,694
She's strong.

425
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,405
She'll be all right.

426
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:22,088
We almost lost her.

427
00:28:24,392 --> 00:28:26,579
And I... almost lost you.

428
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,603
All for a peace agreement
that could fall apart at any moment.

429
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:35,458
And it will only get more difficult.

430
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,110
My enemies will be waiting for me
once we return home.

431
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,750
Despite everything that's happened,
there's one thing I've never doubted.

432
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:49,378
That what you are doing here
is an absolute good.

433
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,219
You have to be strong, too.

434
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,881
We need to get in there fast
before she can do any more damage.

435
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:19,490
I understand the situation,
Mr. Haynam.

436
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:25,707
- How long?
- I need to drill into the mechanism.

437
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,432
Just a couple minutes.

438
00:29:27,718 --> 00:29:29,642
This woman is out of her mind.

439
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,535
Where do you find these people?

440
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,020
She pulled a weapon on me.

441
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,489
- She was ready to use it.
- I seriously doubt that.

442
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:37,024
She was trying to scare you.

443
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,060
Well, she did a very good job.

444
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:44,031
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- O'Brian's going off the deep end.

445
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,528
She thinks she knows
how to get the CTU up and running.

446
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:48,869
But she's locked herself to do it.

447
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,048
We'll be in there in a few seconds.

448
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:52,463
What's she trying to do?

449
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,044
She's trying to tap directly
into the trunk line,

450
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,002
which is a catastrophe
waiting to happen,

451
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,713
Stop what you're doing!

452
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,593
Let's see the gun.

453
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:40,880
Don't shoot or anything.

454
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,260
What I did is crazy.
and I'm in a lot of trouble.

455
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,895
You're damned right.

456
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,638
I did it because it could work.

457
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:51,515
I just need ten more minutes.

458
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,226
- Get her out of here now.
- Let me give the orders.

459
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,229
- She pulled a gun on me!
- I know what she did. Now shut up

460
00:30:57,828 --> 00:30:59,119
and let me handle it.

461
00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:01,901
What were you thinking?

462
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,945
Jack's looking for the rods,
he need our help.

463
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,240
I can get satellite and comm back up
if I finish tapping into the trunk line.

464
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,534
I told Mr. Haynam,
but he wouldn't listen.

465
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:12,284
So I pulled a gun on him.

466
00:31:14,043 --> 00:31:15,831
I didn't want to.
I don't even like guns.

467
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,663
Dana, what's your take on this?

468
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,588
Mr. Haynam is right.

469
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,423
That's dangerous

470
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,550
and there's no guarantee
that it'll work.

471
00:31:27,572 --> 00:31:29,887
Cole could be in trouble.
Aren't you worried about him?

472
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:33,265
I am. That's why I can't go along
with your plan. It's reckless.

473
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,642
I'm sorry.

474
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:37,102
You've never been my fan.
Why start now?

475
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,357
It's not as dangerous
as they're saying.

476
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,733
I've taken precautions.

477
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,486
This can work.
I just need ten minutes.

478
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,138
I can't get the systems online
by then,

479
00:31:49,263 --> 00:31:50,282
fine, arrest me.

480
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,537
You brought me on for this job,
because I didn't think like anyone else.

481
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,081
Ever since I got here,
I've been punished for that.

482
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:59,208
I've been right
more than once today.

483
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:02,169
I think I've proven myself
and I deserve that ten minutes.

484
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:11,845
10 minutes.

485
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,432
You can't be serious.

486
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,935
- You need any help?
- No, just let me work.

487
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,031
Let's give the lady some space.

488
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:31,958
That's all, gentlemen.

489
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:36,203
You are making a huge mistake.

490
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:38,831
Maybe, but I'm willing
to take that chance.

491
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,706
O'Brian proved herself today.
I want to see what she comes up with.

492
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,838
I'd appreciate it
if you and your men would stand by.

493
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:54,498
- What is it?
- A man wants to speak with you...

494
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,432
He says he's a probation officer.

495
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,267
- Probation officer?
- From Arkansas.

496
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,855
- What does he want?
- He didn't say.

497
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:06,522
Put him in Holding 2.
Tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes.

498
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:09,653
Stay here in case O'Brian
needs anything. I'll be in my office.

499
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,561
Mr. Hastings?

500
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,855
We're here, Chloe.
What's your status?

501
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,263
I'm into the trunk line.
I'll activate the bypass circuit.

502
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:49,998
What can we expect?

503
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:51,613
If I don't electrocute myself,

504
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,723
some primary systems
should start booting up.

505
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:56,116
All right, whenever you're ready.

506
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,319
We've got power to comm.

507
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:38,367
And one of the sat links
is back online.

508
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:40,327
Good enough.
Look for Bauer.

509
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:43,274
Chloe, it's working.

510
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,541
- You all right?
- I need more minutes.

511
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,042
I'll be right there.

512
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,513
Mr. Hastings, one more thing.

513
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:52,153
If you do locate Jack,
you need to call Renee Walker.

514
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:55,634
She went out looking for him.
She should be in the vicinity.

515
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:57,078
Will do.

516
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:01,632
Why don't you go see
if Miss O'Brian needs a hand?

517
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,353
And be civil this time.

518
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,943
Come on, Owen.
Stay with me.

519
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:19,914
Stay with me.

520
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:25,703
He's gone.

521
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,422
I lost two of the snipers. If we'll make
a move, we got to do it soon.

522
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,327
We can't lay down cover fire
for something we can't see.

523
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,014
Give them something to shoot at.

524
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:42,139
I'll make a break to the north,
draw their fire, run for the call box.

525
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:44,452
That's a suicide play.
You'll never make it.

526
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:45,601
But you will.

527
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:48,244
- I can't let you do that.
- I'm in command here.

528
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,688
That's what gonna happen.

529
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,479
Do you understand?

530
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:58,155
- I need you to do me a favor.
- What is it?

531
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,314
You make sure
that Hastings keeps his promise.

532
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,869
That he doesn't bring Renee back in.

533
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:06,205
I give you my word.

534
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:09,515
You won't have long
before they fire on you.

535
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,940
Good luck, Jack.

536
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:13,087
You make it to that call box.

537
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:17,389
Go.

538
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:13,981
Clear!

539
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:33,612
It's okay.

540
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,168
It's me, Renee.

541
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:40,454
They got the fuel rods in a boat.

542
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,758
They're heading across the river
into the city.

543
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:44,303
I can't breathe.

544
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:46,100
Nothing went through.

545
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,076
Relax.

546
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,022
You may have a collapsed lung...

547
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:53,328
I got through to CTU.
They got back online.

548
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:55,898
NYPD's sending choppers.
We get a good shot at finding them.

549
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:09,932
Mr. Hastings,
I just got a call from Agent Ortiz.

550
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,578
The nuclear rods are on a Zodiac
with two terrorists aboard.

551
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:15,289
They were heading northwest
across the river toward the city.

552
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:17,210
- Where are the choppers?
- A second.

553
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:21,006
- They arrived.
- Redirect them.

554
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:24,264
Start diverting all available NYPD units
to that shoreline.

555
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,178
We need to lay down a cordon.

556
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:32,775
- Thanks. You were...
- I'm not good with praise.

557
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,779
What do you think you're doing?

558
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:27,698
My job.

559
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,159
I've answered all your questions.
Why won't you just leave?

560
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:32,941
I can't do that.

561
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,136
I know you were involved
with that robbery, Ms. Walsh.

562
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:37,235
What?

563
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,377
I think you know exactly where Kevin is.
I think you're protecting him.

564
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:43,088
- You are out of your mind.
- And you're a liar.

565
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,294
I'm not leaving here
until I know the truth.

566
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:51,339
This'll go a lot smoother for you
if you just...

567
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:53,097
come clean right now.

568
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:56,184
It's not too late, Ms. Walsh.

569
00:39:57,204 --> 00:39:59,304
But I promise you, if you don't,

570
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,988
I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall.

571
00:41:11,857 --> 00:41:12,957
Contact CTU.

572
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:16,132
See if they picked 'em up
going across the river.

573
00:41:33,511 --> 00:41:34,511
It's me.

574
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:36,118
CTU's back online.

575
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:37,765
I know.

576
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,913
There are helicopters.

577
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:41,918
They're getting close.

578
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:45,328
- You should have warned us earlier.
- I didn't have time.

579
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:47,433
I was too busy preserving my cover.

580
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,330
I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to stay under.

581
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:53,468
- I thought you took care of it.
- So did I.

582
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:55,077
It came back.

583
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:57,055
We can't stay.

584
00:41:57,438 --> 00:41:59,955
The police must already
be cordoning off the area.

585
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,186
- We'll need your help getting clear.
- I will get you out of there.

586
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:04,766
Don't worry.

587
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:07,149
Stand by.
I'll call you in a few minutes.
