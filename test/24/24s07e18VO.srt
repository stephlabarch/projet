1
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,882
Previously on 24

2
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:14,369
Mr. knowles, my name is jack bauer.

3
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,400
Jonas hodges is in possession of a military-grade bioweapon.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,760
I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,400
I promise you, sir, the weapon is on your base.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,236
Do you have any idea where they might be?

7
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:24,960
I think I might.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,260
I have an order from the president of the united states.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,560
To search this building.

10
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,160
Are there weapons of mass destruction?

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,735
Are there weapons of any kind?

12
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:33,967
You've got five minutes

13
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,133
To get these helicopters flying out of here

14
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:37,563
With all of you on board.

15
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,802
Larry, I want you and your men

16
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,230
To pull out on hodges' timetable.

17
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,260
Tony, you're gonna need to find a way to stay behind.

18
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,161
We're gonna get your vectors over to a man

19
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:45,503
That we contacted inside starkwood.

20
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:46,661
His name is douglas knowles.

21
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,162
He believes he knows where the weapons are.

22
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,761
Stay here. I'll be right back.

23
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:54,003
Jack!

24
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,461
We need a medic!

25
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:57,462
The bioagent is more virulent than we thought.

26
00:00:57,535 --> 00:01:00,130
All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.

27
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:01,671
I understand.

28
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,330
There's something you may want to consider.

29
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:04,601
What's that?

30
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,461
A possible treatment using stem cells

31
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,190
From a genetically compatible donor.

32
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:09,763
I saw your file, and it says you have a daughter.

33
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:13,002
I don't want my daughter involved in this.

34
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,033
It should be her choice.

35
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:16,133
Well, it's not.

36
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:17,802
I'm the one who's dying.

37
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,032
I'm in.

38
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:20,633
But they got knowles.

39
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,503
A little loyalty.

40
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:24,301
Wasn't that the least I deserved?

41
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,731
You can't take on the federal government.

42
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,500
I have a visual on the weapon.

43
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:34,930
Okay, those are the canisters.

44
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:38,032
I'll notify admiral smith the target is located and confirmed.

45
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:41,002
You remember starkwood was deployed to pakistan,

46
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,830
That we requisitioned a missile system at that time.

47
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:46,402
Well, three of those missiles

48
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:47,902
Are now loaded with a pathogen

49
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:51,032
And aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard.

50
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:53,033
You will keep this conversation to yourself

51
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,230
And turn the planes around.

52
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:56,663
And if you do not comply, madam president,

53
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:58,402
I will have no choice

54
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,201
But to launch those missiles.

55
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,202
Abort the air strike, admiral smith.

56
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:03,360
Ma'am, with all respect...

57
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:04,401
Damn it, admiral.

58
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,602
Abort the air strike immediately!

59
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:13,641
The following takes place between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.

60
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:35,433
Tony, it's jack.

61
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,602
Do you copy?

62
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,062
Jack, what the hell is going on?

63
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:39,333
Where are those f-18s?

64
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,200
Tim woods just called from the white house.

65
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,033
The president canceled the air strike.

66
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:44,062
What?

67
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:45,131
Why?

68
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,533
She doesn't believe our intel

69
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,332
Is strong enough to justify military action.

70
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,033
Is she out of her mind?

71
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,231
Jack, I saw those canisters with my own eyes.

72
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,761
So did you. they're in that bunker.

73
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:56,363
- She's not gonna get any better intel than that. - I know.

74
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:57,762
It doesn't make any sense, but right now,

75
00:02:57,837 --> 00:02:59,330
We've got a presidential order to pull you out

76
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:00,903
Of the starkwood compound, along with the perimeter teams.

77
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,361
Tony, larry's been told the president's decision.

78
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:04,601
He's preparing to move his teams out, but he's got

79
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,060
To get you out of there first.

80
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:08,132
He'll be sending you coordinates for an exfiltration point

81
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:10,403
Along the southwest perimeter.

82
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:11,700
Tony?

83
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,763
Hold on a second.

84
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:22,800
Tony, what's going on?

85
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,500
Jack, I might know

86
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:26,530
Why the president called off that air strike.

87
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,062
What do you mean?

88
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:31,600
I think starkwood's got surface-to-surface missiles.

89
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,362
That's how they're gonna deploy the bioweapon.

90
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:34,902
How do you know this?

91
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:37,702
A fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker

92
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:39,262
Where they're storing the weapons.

93
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:44,023
They're pumping rp-7 into an underground depot.

94
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:44,761
What's rp-7?

95
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:47,301
It's a propellant only used in surface-to-surface missiles.

96
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,501
Tony, are you sure?

97
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:50,032
I'm looking right at it, jack.

98
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:54,032
Do you have any c-4 on you?

99
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:56,333
Yeah, I've got three charges and a remote detonator.

100
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,763
Do you think you can gain access to the underground fuel depot?

101
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,300
Yeah, I think we've got a play,

102
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:01,931
But I've got to move soon...

103
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,700
Before that fuel truck pulls away.

104
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,332
Okay, I want you to maintain your position.

105
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:06,703
I'm gonna call the president.

106
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,731
Come with me.

107
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,800
What is it, tim?

108
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,003
Madam president, the joint chiefs

109
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,600
Are beginning to question your decision

110
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,561
To call off the air strike against starkwood.

111
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:26,061
They think the intelligence we received from tony almeida

112
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:28,233
Was sufficient and that we may be missing

113
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,512
An opportunity to destroy the bioweapons.

114
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,663
Gave my orders, tim.

115
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,300
No air strike.

116
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:36,830
No military action of any kind against starkwood.

117
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,813
Now, I asked you to handle the joint chiefs;

118
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:41,721
Handle them.

119
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:42,401
I'll do my best, ma'am,

120
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:43,633
But if I may...

121
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,710
What is our next move?

122
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,330
Jonas hodges is coming to the white house.

123
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,001
He wants to speak with me alone.

124
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:57,160
- For what possible reason? - I don't know.

125
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:58,763
Madam president, shouldn't your advisors

126
00:04:58,836 --> 00:04:59,761
Be at that meeting?

127
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:01,731
Tim, stop asking me questions.

128
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:06,802
If you want to help,

129
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,830
Make sure as few people as possible know

130
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,433
That jonas hodges is coming here.

131
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:14,830
And bring him in through the southeast service entrance.

132
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:17,160
Yes?

133
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:18,530
Madam president, jack bauer

134
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,900
And renee walker are calling from fbi.

135
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,173
You did speak to fbi?

136
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:23,602
Yes, ma'am, five minutes ago.

137
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,101
I gave them your reason for calling off

138
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,660
The air strike, but I must warn you,

139
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:28,602
They were skeptical as well.

140
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:30,100
Be ready for hodges.

141
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,360
Mr. bauer,

142
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,903
Agent walker, this is the president.

143
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,460
Madam president, we need to talk.

144
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,765
No, mr. bauer, we don't.

145
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,937
You need to listen.

146
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,603
I appreciate everything that you have done

147
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,903
In gathering this intel,

148
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,581
But I still need more

149
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,032
Before I can authorize an air strike.

150
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,030
I'm sorry.

151
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:52,360
Madam president, with all due respect,

152
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:55,830
I don't believe you're being truthful with us.

153
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,362
Excuse me?

154
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:58,803
I think you called off the air strike

155
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,131
Because jonas hodges is in possession

156
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,503
Of surface-to-surface missiles armed with the bioweapon,

157
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,960
And he's threatening to use them

158
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,833
In case you try to take action against him.

159
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,760
Madam president, tony almeida witnessed a truck

160
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:11,903
Pumping rp-7 rocket fuel into an underground depot

161
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,301
Situated right next to the bunker

162
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,131
Where the bioweapons are being stored.

163
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,530
The only purpose for rp-7 rocket fuel

164
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:18,960
Is to launch missiles.

165
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,600
Madam president, please just tell us the truth.

166
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,900
Jack, hodges has 13 python missiles

167
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,660
Armed with the bioweapons.

168
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,963
Three are currently aimed at american cities.

169
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,802
He demanded that I recall the planes,

170
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:36,801
Or he would launch.

171
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:37,931
What does hodges want?

172
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,133
I don't know...

173
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,162
But he's requested a face-to-face meeting.

174
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,501
He'll be at the white house in a few minutes.

175
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,962
Madam president, the only reason he wants

176
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,932
A face-to-face meeting is to lay out his demands,

177
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,031
And whatever they are, you cannot negotiate with him.

178
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,461
I'm not planning on negotiating with him, jack.

179
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,300
Once he places his cards on the table,

180
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:55,932
I am sure that I can... I can make him realize

181
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,403
The futility of what he is trying to do.

182
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:01,003
Jonas hodges is a traitor and a terrorist,

183
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,430
And after everything that's happened today,

184
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:03,601
Are you really naive enough

185
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,462
To believe that you can simply talk to him

186
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,533
And change his mind?

187
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,130
I'm not new at this, jack,

188
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:10,160
And right now, I don't have another option.

189
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,331
Madam president, you do.

190
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,682
Tony almeida is still inside starkwood.

191
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:15,993
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.

192
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:17,273
What's he still doing there?

193
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,082
I asked him to stand by until I could talk to you.

194
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,310
He believes he can gain access to the fuel depot

195
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:22,672
And lay a series of explosive charges

196
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,960
And take the missiles out.

197
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,433
Now, I believe this can work, but we need to act quickly.

198
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,801
What about the bioweapons?

199
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,262
Rp-7 rocket fuel burns at 5,000 degrees.

200
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,762
There will be nothing left.

201
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:33,901
Once the weapons are destroyed, larry moss and his teams

202
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,163
Can move in on starkwood and lock it down.

203
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,533
Hodges gave standing orders to his men

204
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:40,931
To launch the missiles at the first detection

205
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:42,933
Of government interference.

206
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,360
If Almeida is detected,

207
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:46,702
Thousands of americans will die, Jack.

208
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,402
Madam president, I know that there's a risk,

209
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,460
But I would not be asking you to do this

210
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,633
If I didn't think it would work.

211
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,863
Please, I am begging you.

212
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:56,643
Trust me.

213
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,443
How long did the doctors give you to live?

214
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,060
Uh, they're not sure,

215
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:13,062
But the pathogen has started to take effect.

216
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:18,633
Then there's not much I can threaten you with, is there?

217
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:23,500
I expect you'll do what you think is right.

218
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,861
What the hell does that mean?

219
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,760
She wants us to go in.

220
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:39,330
But she didn't authorize it.

221
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:40,462
She can't.

222
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:42,603
She needs this to be a covert operation.

223
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,003
If something were to go wrong

224
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,482
And those missiles were to be launched,

225
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,130
The president needs to be able to swear

226
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,720
Under oath that we were working on our own

227
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,602
She wants us to go in.

228
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,060
Notify Larry. we need to move fast.

229
00:08:57,507 --> 00:08:59,700
I told you I'd get you to the white house.

230
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,862
I just didn't think it would be

231
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,662
Under these conditions.

232
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:08,031
It was brilliant, you know.

233
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,602
What was that, sir?

234
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,963
What you did to make Almeida think

235
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,442
That you were betraying me.

236
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:17,463
Quite brilliant.

237
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:18,623
Thank you, sir.

238
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:22,063
You put yourself in harm's way, greg,

239
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:24,202
And I'll never forget that.

240
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:29,902
I can't believe... I'm feeling nervous.

241
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,261
You're gonna do fine, sir.

242
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,660
Thank you, Tim.

243
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,101
You're welcome.

244
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,400
So, it sounds to me like the president

245
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:41,000
Didn't actually authorize this.

246
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:42,202
Technically, no.

247
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,432
It was more of an... an indirect order,

248
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:46,503
But believe me, Larry, she wants this to happen.

249
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:48,160
She's gonna meet with Hodges,

250
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,100
And we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.

251
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:54,062
Larry, do you have a problem with this?

252
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,032
As a matter of fact, no.

253
00:09:58,107 --> 00:09:59,501
None whatsoever.

254
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,830
These Starkwood bastards drew on my men.

255
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,562
I'm looking forward to getting back in there.

256
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,800
All right, have your teams hold their position

257
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:06,860
And be ready to move.

258
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,360
Believe me, you'll know when it happens.

259
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,702
All right.

260
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:26,660
Tony,

261
00:10:26,738 --> 00:10:28,363
- It's Jack. do you copy? - Yeah, I'm here.

262
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:29,430
You were right about the missiles.

263
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:30,461
The president confirmed it.

264
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:31,501
We're gonna have to carry this out

265
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:32,763
As a covert operation.

266
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:34,502
Larry and his men are standing by to lock down Starkwood

267
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:36,131
As soon as the missiles have been destroyed.

268
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,201
- Good. - Tony...

269
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,831
I need to know that you can do this

270
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,033
Without being detected.

271
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,630
Hodges's given his men standing orders

272
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,900
To launch those missiles if there's a breach of any kind.

273
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,060
Yeah. I can do it.

274
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:47,933
Okay. good luck.

275
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,001
Yeah.

276
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,933
We're done here.

277
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,162
I'm going to go run a perimeter check.

278
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:07,931
You said you just finished one.

279
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,361
I know.

280
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,701
But I don't think we can be too careful right now.

281
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,931
- yeah. - It's me.

282
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,461
Auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.

283
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:38,960
Confirmed.

284
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,663
I'll be down in a few minutes.

285
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:41,731
Copy that.

286
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,261
Freeze!

287
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:48,331
Let me see your hands.

288
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:53,031
Almeida.

289
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,361
Put your gun on the ground.

290
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,433
Slowly.

291
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:03,630
Kick it.

292
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,701
Drag him under the truck.

293
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,343
Now! let's go!

294
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,203
Hands up.

295
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:26,960
What do you think you're doing?

296
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,152
You're going to take me down to the fuel tanks.

297
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,033
Let's go.

298
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:49,863
Open it up.

299
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:57,751
Go ahead.

300
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,403
President will see you now.

301
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:27,000
Very good. Thank you.

302
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,033
Mr. Hodges.

303
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:34,530
Madam president.

304
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,830
This is Greg Seaton,

305
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,172
My associate.

306
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:39,640
He's a remarkable man.

307
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:40,841
Doesn't look remarkable,

308
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:42,860
But believe me, he's a genius.

309
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,701
Yes, I know Mr. Seaton.

310
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:49,160
Thank you, gentlemen.

311
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:53,133
It never gets old, does it?

312
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:57,263
Stepping into the... the Oval Office.

313
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:58,302
Almost

314
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,262
Smells of history.

315
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:01,303
Can we sit?

316
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:03,333
Please.

317
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,602
You know, this is the first Time

318
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,630
I've been in this room since you were elected?

319
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,032
I'm aware of that, yes.

320
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,491
Under your predecessor,

321
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:13,560
I used to drop by every couple of months.

322
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,732
I'd brief President Daniels

323
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,900
On what was really going on in the world.

324
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,401
And you've been excluded now.

325
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:23,631
Is that what this is about?

326
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:25,463
No, ma'am.

327
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:26,901
It's about allowing Starkwood

328
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,900
To fulfill the purpose for which was founded

329
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:30,931
Protecting this country.

330
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,663
You have been attacking this country.

331
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,333
You and General Juma

332
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,331
Have killed hundreds of innocent people,

333
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:40,400
Including my son.

334
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:43,573
Madam president,

335
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:47,260
I'm deeply sorry for your loss,

336
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,063
And my heart breaks

337
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:50,733
For all the lives that were taken today,

338
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,903
But I'm shocked

339
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:53,402
That you would think that I had anything

340
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,202
- To do with it. - we have evidence

341
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,262
That you've been working with juma.

342
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,863
Your intelligence agencies have failed you.

343
00:15:00,937 --> 00:15:02,732
If I had known what juma was up to,

344
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:05,531
I would have done everything in my power to stop him.

345
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,930
So let's push aside all these baseless accusations

346
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,932
And maybe we can do some business here.

347
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,002
I'm listening.

348
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,963
Madam president,

349
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,963
I know you're a student of history,

350
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,432
And so you're well aware

351
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,432
That our nation's independence was won

352
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:23,663
With the aid of private armies,

353
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:26,833
And we can't survive without them.

354
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,231
Look how easy it was to get bioweapons into this country.

355
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:30,833
Our defenses are fragile.

356
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,730
They're on the verge of collapse.

357
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,803
But it's not too late to do something about it.

358
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,003
So what are you suggesting?

359
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,003
In short,

360
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,961
I want a seat at the table.

361
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:44,692
Starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping

362
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,000
Of military policy, domestic and global.

363
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,161
It sounds more like

364
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:52,331
You want a seat at the head of the table.

365
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:55,501
Madam president, I'm not here to supplant your authority.

366
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:57,531
What I'm proposing is a partnership.

367
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,661
Think of Starkwood

368
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,730
As the fifth branch of the military.

369
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:03,830
Greg?

370
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,660
This contains the protocols

371
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,732
That will serve as the basis of our agreement.

372
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:13,503
I suggest that we review them together.

373
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,503
Jonas, I agreed to this meeting

374
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:19,430
Because I wanted to hear what you had to say.

375
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:22,263
But what you're proposing is blackmail.

376
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:25,203
Well, that's putting it in the worst possible light.

377
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,732
You are threatening to kill thousands of people.

378
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:34,061
I'm not proud of this chapter.

379
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:36,862
I'm the first to admit it.

380
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:38,102
And it's time to turn the page.

381
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,103
This country has seen enough bloodshed today.

382
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,103
For the sake of the american people, madam president,

383
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,562
I implore you to work with me,

384
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,101
And let's move past this.

385
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:58,302
Pick up the document, madam president.

386
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:23,163
Let's go.

387
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:24,823
Come on. get up now, or I'll leave you down here.

388
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,280
And you don't want that, believe me. get up!

389
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:26,861
Let's go!

390
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:13,961
Come on!

391
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:22,631
What is it?

392
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,430
Code 363.

393
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:25,463
That's a government breach.

394
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,730
We're supposed to launch.

395
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,001
Are you sure it's not a false alarm?

396
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,132
No way to tell.

397
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:30,932
We've got standing orders, though.

398
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:32,690
Let's start the launch sequence.

399
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:41,162
Too late.

400
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,761
Launch sequence complete.

401
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:55,402
Target is locked.

402
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,762
Enter the firing codes.

403
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:58,163
Sir, we need to confirm this.

404
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,100
That's not the correct protocol.

405
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,461
We're about to kill 10,000 people.

406
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,403
We should get someone on the phone.

407
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,000
Enter the codes.

408
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:06,031
Now!

409
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:07,732
No, sir.

410
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:46,363
That's it. that's us. let's go.

411
00:19:46,438 --> 00:19:47,530
We're a go!

412
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:49,432
We're a go!

413
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:01,100
It's done.

414
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,463
Tony?

415
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,700
Tony, do you copy?

416
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,101
An explosion of that magnitude would have shorted out his com.

417
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,503
We're gonna have to wait for larry and his men to move in.

418
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,100
It says here that you want

419
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,963
Active status in the pentagon's strategic planning group.

420
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,461
That's correct.

421
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:27,330
That would give you access to level 6 classified material.

422
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:29,160
Not even the vice president has that clearance.

423
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:31,510
These points are nonnegotiable.

424
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:34,533
I'm not here to debate them.

425
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:35,960
Let's review the next section,

426
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,301
Which concerns senate oversight of starkwood field operations.

427
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,730
I'm sorry to interrupt, madam president, but I need

428
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:43,733
To speak with you.

429
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:44,863
Can it wait?

430
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,830
No, ma'am, it can't.

431
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,332
Will you excuse me for a moment?

432
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,402
Of course.

433
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:02,601
Satcom has just detected

434
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,662
A massive explosion on the starkwood compound.

435
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:06,761
The bioweapons facility has been destroyed.

436
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:08,600
- Are you sure? - Yes, ma'am.

437
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:09,263
Judging by the size of the explosion,

438
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,301
Nothing could have survived.

439
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:11,830
But I don't know how this happened.

440
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:13,132
This wasn't us.

441
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,802
Call FBI and have them lock down starkwood.

442
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,960
- They're already moving in. - Good.

443
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:20,602
And when this is over, I want to speak to jack bauer.

444
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:21,703
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:27,830
I'm not sure I'm reaching her.

446
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:30,510
I think you handled it perfectly, sir.

447
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,372
We'll see.

448
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:37,630
What the hell is this?

449
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:40,362
Put this document into evidence, and take these men

450
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:41,730
Into custody.

451
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,303
What are you thinking? Have you lost your mind?

452
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:45,831
Jonas, we've taken out your missiles.

453
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,001
It's over.

454
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:50,530
That's impossible.

455
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:53,033
It's the truth.

456
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,203
And you're under arrest.

457
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:57,630
You are a terrorist and a murderer,

458
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,290
And I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure

459
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,561
That you pay dearly for your crimes.

460
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:07,403
My only crime is that I'm trying to protect

461
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:08,732
My country!

462
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:11,562
You think this ends with me?

463
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:13,763
I'm just a small cog in a very big machine.

464
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:14,960
Hold on.

465
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,401
You can't even begin to imagine what you're up against.

466
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:22,962
What are you talking about?

467
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:27,133
You'll find out.

468
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:32,631
Get him out of here.

469
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:04,960
Evase by wise protein were put in new trace

470
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:06,682
bioweapen were near the blast sight.

471
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:07,960
It was incinerated in the explosion.

472
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,762
Good.

473
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:11,131
- Any word on tony? - Not yet.

474
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,303
Larry's searching the compound now.

475
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,602
We should hear something soon.

476
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,731
Mr. Bauer,

477
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:16,832
You have a phone call; it's the president.

478
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,330
I'll take it in the conference room. thank you.

479
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:20,863
I'll be right back.

480
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:33,431
Madam president.

481
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:37,632
Mr. bauer, jonas hodges is under arrest.

482
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,832
That's good news.

483
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:40,100
That's very good.

484
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:44,531
Jack, you and your team provided me with an option.

485
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:47,433
And for that, I am deeply grateful.

486
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,933
And so are the american people.

487
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:52,361
Madam president, it was tony almeida

488
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,930
Who risked his life to destroy those missiles.

489
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:56,260
And as you know, he's facing arrest

490
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:57,832
For things he did leading up to today,

491
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:59,530
And I was hoping that maybe

492
00:23:59,608 --> 00:24:02,032
You could...

493
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,931
Yes, mr. bauer?

494
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:10,461
Jack?

495
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:13,932
Um, I'm sorry, I...

496
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:16,562
Completely forgot what I was saying.

497
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:19,402
You were talking about Mr. Almeida.

498
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:21,223
And my answer is yes,

499
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,313
I-I will take his actions into account.

500
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:24,731
Thank you.

501
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,133
What's happening?

502
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:32,363
I-I-I'm not exactly sure.

503
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,562
Jack, I am so sorry you're going through this.

504
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:37,902
I wish that there were something I could do.

505
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:40,800
M-madam president, I appreciate this phone call.

506
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:43,560
But I'm sorry. I-I have to go.

507
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:44,561
Of course.

508
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:45,662
Thank you.

509
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:55,332
Jonas hodges has been arrested.

510
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:56,330
Let me know

511
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:57,730
As soon as you got tony.

512
00:24:57,805 --> 00:24:59,500
I need to go see dr. macer.

513
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,232
Yes, madam president?

514
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:05,661
Call ben landry at cdc.

515
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:08,301
Tell him that I want real-time updates

516
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:09,592
On jack bauer's condition.

517
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:10,730
Yes, ma'am.

518
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,801
We've secured all entry points and command posts

519
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:27,802
And are sweeping the compound on a grid-by-grid basis.

520
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:28,961
Are you meeting any resistance?

521
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:30,603
No.

522
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,830
They're surrendering peacefully and cooperating.

523
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,001
Most of the men on this base,

524
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,763
I don't think they had any idea what was going on.

525
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,460
What about almeida?

526
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,032
Uh, he's here.

527
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:42,030
We found him.

528
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,702
- Is he okay? - Some cuts and bruises,

529
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:45,562
But otherwise, he's in pretty good shape.

530
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:46,763
Good. good.

531
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,231
Jack will be glad to hear that.

532
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:50,530
Listen, renee...

533
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:52,630
We've known each other a long time, you know.

534
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:55,213
Um, so much stuff has happened today.

535
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:56,301
Yeah.

536
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,462
We have a lot to talk about.

537
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:58,221
I know.

538
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:01,333
Excuse me, agent walker. she's in the waiting area.

539
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:02,383
Okay, thank you.

540
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:04,332
Larry, I've got to go.

541
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:05,400
- Kim bauer's here. - Jack's daughter?

542
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:07,103
Yes. I-I asked her to come.

543
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,600
There's this experimental treatment

544
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,603
For jack's disease, but he needs compatible stem cells.

545
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:14,760
It's a long shot, but it's the only hope he's got.

546
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:16,640
Okay.

547
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:17,933
Let me know how it goes, all right?

548
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:19,661
I will. I'm going off com.

549
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:22,303
All right.

550
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:25,560
Did they say something about kim bauer?

551
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:28,400
Yeah, she's at FBI

552
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:29,803
Helping with a treatment for jack,

553
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:31,632
Some, uh, some kind of stem cell therapy.

554
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:33,933
So they think he's gonna be all right?

555
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:36,303
Didn't sound promising.

556
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:41,432
Listen, tony, this isn't easy for me,

557
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:44,362
But, uh... I'm under orders

558
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:45,730
To take you into federal custody.

559
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:47,983
Yeah, I know.

560
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:49,062
You did a brave thing here.

561
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:51,261
Probably saved thousands of lives.

562
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:53,233
For the record,

563
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:55,400
I don't think this is how you should be repaid.

564
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:57,661
I appreciate that, but, uh...

565
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,460
I'm ready to pay for what I've done.

566
00:27:02,168 --> 00:27:03,401
Get the cuffs off him, will you?

567
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,463
Chopper's on the way.

568
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,562
I'll be taking you back to fbi, all right?

569
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:15,303
Memory loss is consistent with the disease,Mr. bauer.

570
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,360
I just wouldn't have expected it to manifest this quickly.

571
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:21,232
It's not just memory loss.

572
00:27:22,158 --> 00:27:23,303
It feels like...

573
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:29,302
I don't know exactly how to explain it.

574
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:31,601
I feel like, uh,

575
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:33,960
Like I'm losing some part of myself.

576
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:36,003
The disease profile includes

577
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:39,630
Personality changes, sometis even hallucinations.

578
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:41,432
But this is a weaponized pathogen

579
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:42,663
We don't know much about.

580
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:45,563
Military's still combing through the remains

581
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:47,101
Of the bioweapons lab in sangala,

582
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,833
So we expect to learn something very soon.

583
00:27:49,907 --> 00:27:52,662
You were able to give me something that controlled the shaking.

584
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,233
Is there anything that you can give me

585
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,263
That would help me with this?

586
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:57,831
No.

587
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm sorry.

588
00:28:01,605 --> 00:28:03,301
Okay.

589
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,930
Thank you. excuse me.

590
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:20,700
Jack, is it all right?

591
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,031
Yeah, um,

592
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:25,333
I'm gonna need to go on record about everything that happened today.

593
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:26,630
And we need to do it soon.

594
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,460
I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be

595
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:29,423
Able to provide you with the details.

596
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:30,723
Okay.

597
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:33,360
First, there's something that you need to know.

598
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:34,962
What?

599
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:36,863
It's about kim.

600
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:38,362
She's here, jack.

601
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:39,862
I told her that you were sick

602
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,533
And that she might be able to help

603
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:43,731
With the treatment.

604
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,801
You did...

605
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:49,730
You did what?

606
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:50,730
Come here.

607
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:51,693
Come here.

608
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:58,502
Who the hell do you think you are?

609
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:01,772
Who the hell do you think you are?

610
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,761
You think this is easy?

611
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:06,761
You think you understand what I'm going through?

612
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:07,832
Because you don't.

613
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,273
I am dying.

614
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:11,262
And I was okay with it.

615
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:13,860
I could handle it.

616
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:16,961
And now you've put in front of me the one thing,

617
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:19,532
The one thing that is gonna make this unbearable.

618
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:21,503
- Jack, listen... - No, you listen to me.

619
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:25,422
I specifically told you do not drag my daughter into this.

620
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:27,851
No one dragged her into anything.

621
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:29,400
She's been trying to see you all day.

622
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:36,902
What?

623
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:40,202
She was at the senate hearing this morning.

624
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:42,860
She flew out from L.A. to be there,

625
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:44,862
But we pulled you out before she could see you.

626
00:29:44,938 --> 00:29:46,803
She's been leaving messages at our office all day.

627
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:48,862
They just didn't get to me till now.

628
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:55,000
If you want, I can tell her that you're not here.

629
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:58,063
I can tell her that you can't see her.

630
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:03,531
Can't do that.

631
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:09,000
Where is she?

632
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:10,863
Down the hall.

633
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:13,463
Show me.

634
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:46,131
Daddy.

635
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:52,000
How are you feeling?

636
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:55,400
I'm-i'm okay.

637
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,930
You're not in any pain?

638
00:30:58,008 --> 00:30:59,733
No.

639
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,430
Come sit down.

640
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:20,831
Did agent Walker tell you that I was trying to find you?

641
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:24,262
Yeah.

642
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:27,162
I've tried everything to track you down.

643
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,001
State department, private investigators.

644
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,762
Every time I got a phone number or an address,

645
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,760
You were already gone.

646
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:35,462
I'm sorry.

647
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:38,062
I thought I was doing the best thing for you

648
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:39,532
By staying away.

649
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,161
Daddy, I've missed you so much.

650
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:51,833
I've missed you,too.

651
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:55,263
You need to know how sorry I am

652
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:58,130
For everything that you've had to live through because of me.

653
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,630
No, don't do that.

654
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:00,933
Don't put that on yourself.

655
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,502
I'm the one that should apologize.

656
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:03,831
I pushed you away.

657
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:05,730
And instead of taking responsibility

658
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:09,933
For all the mistakes I've made in my life, I blamed you.

659
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:12,301
And it was stupid

660
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,361
And immature.

661
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:19,202
And now, all the time that we've lost...

662
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:25,803
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance--

663
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:29,162
A small chance-- that I could help you,

664
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:30,861
And you don't want me to.

665
00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:32,892
The treatment is experimental.

666
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:35,462
And I don't think it's going to work.

667
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:38,631
And you don't want to because you're afraid to ask me.

668
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,700
No.

669
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:43,832
There's a risk to you.

670
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:46,360
A small risk...

671
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:47,872
Worth taking.

672
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:49,432
Not to me.

673
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,261
Kim... I'm dying.

674
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:59,430
And whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening--

675
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:03,291
It is not worth the pain for me to let you

676
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,851
Sit there and watch me die.

677
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:07,733
Daddy, I don't want to lose you.

678
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:09,902
Come here.

679
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,390
I don't.

680
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:14,801
Sweetheart, it's going to be all right.

681
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,430
It's gonna be all right. I promise you.

682
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,232
What is it?

683
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,962
What?

684
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:33,463
Sweetheart, I'm sorry...

685
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:36,733
But you need to go.

686
00:33:39,138 --> 00:33:41,231
Please, baby, please, I'm begging you.

687
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,533
I love you so much.

688
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,430
Honey, I love you, too. please, baby.

689
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,403
Thank you. Go.

690
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:36,763
Perimeter 2 to Dispatch. Auxiliary gate 6 is clear.

691
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:39,601
Copy that, P-2. hold your position.

692
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:49,071
Freeze!

693
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:50,391
Show me your hands.

694
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:51,782
Get 'em up!

695
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,292
P-2 to Dispatch.

696
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:07,102
I have an agent down and a suspect in custody.

697
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,300
Code red.

698
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,762
Copy that, P-2.

699
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:11,801
All available agents respond to auxiliary gate 6.

700
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,363
- Drop the bag. - Code red.

701
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:20,761
Hands on the hood.

702
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,062
Danger,hazardous materiel

703
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,562
P-2 to Dispatch.

704
00:35:41,636 --> 00:35:43,930
Put me through to agent Moss. it's urgent.

705
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,031
Agent Moss.

706
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,463
Agent Moss, this is Davis at auxiliary gate 6.

707
00:35:51,535 --> 00:35:53,300
I have a Starkwood op in custody.

708
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:54,861
He killed one of our agents.

709
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:56,630
He was carrying a canister of the bioweapon,

710
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:57,733
Trying to smuggle it out

711
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:58,903
Using one of our vehicles.

712
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:00,800
What?! are you sure?

713
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:02,732
I'm looking at it right now.

714
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:08,403
Agent davis?

715
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,261
Davis?!

716
00:36:15,537 --> 00:36:17,233
Walker.

717
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:19,532
Renee, we got a breach in the cordon at gate 6.

718
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:20,700
One of the starkwood ops--

719
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:22,162
He's got a canister of the bioweapon.

720
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:23,332
What?

721
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:24,660
It was id'd by agent davis,

722
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,230
Who I believe has just been shot.

723
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:28,232
The suspect may be fleeing in an FBI vehicle,

724
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:30,461
So I need you to close down all access roads,

725
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:32,063
And alert perimeter units and metro police.

726
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:33,333
Janis, get me DC metro.

727
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:34,831
I'm gonna pursue it from the air.

728
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:37,001
Let's go! let us up!

729
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:39,900
Renee,

730
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,802
Alert homeland, let them know what's going on.

731
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,730
Are we thinking this is another attack, larry?

732
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:45,602
I don't know, but there's enough prion variant

733
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,300
In one of those canisters to take out a small city.

734
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,161
Agent miller, are there any major roadways

735
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:14,533
In our perimeter that Starkwood operatives could have used?

736
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:15,703
Yes, sir.

737
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:17,000
We're coming up on highway 42.

738
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:18,332
Should I turn us that way?

739
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,433
Yeah, let's head that way until we hear something from agent Walker.

740
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,430
Roger that.

741
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:25,733
Yes, sir. we'll keep homeland apprised

742
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:27,431
With real-time updates.

743
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:30,340
Did you access the GPS locator system?

744
00:37:30,345 --> 00:37:31,930
Yeah, I'm scanning transponders

745
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:33,400
for the stolen FBI vehicle.

746
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:34,123
How long will that take?

747
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,561
As long as it takes for the satellite to reposition.

748
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:40,931
When you spoke to Larry, you mentioned an attack?

749
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:42,901
The Starkwood operative,

750
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:45,630
We're trying to find a stolen canister of the bioweapon.

751
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:47,733
I thought Tony Almeida destroyed all the weapons.

752
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,371
Apparently not.

753
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:51,322
How did this operative get past our perimeter?

754
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:53,440
Shot and killed two of our agents.

755
00:37:55,276 --> 00:37:56,082
This is it.

756
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:59,360
The suspect is getting off highway 42 at moketree avenue.

757
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:01,301
He's heading toward the industrial corridor.

758
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,100
Put me on the interagency channel.

759
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,801
- Go ahead. - All units, this is

760
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,000
Agent walker with FBI.

761
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:09,033
Suspect has exited highway 42 at smoketree.

762
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:10,632
He's heading north into the industrial corridor.

763
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,203
Units in the vicinity, please respond.

764
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:13,361
Renee, it's me.

765
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,702
We're over smoketree right now.

766
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:16,462
We're redirecting, and we'll tighten our pursuit.

767
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:19,062
Got it. I'll reroute swat team alpha to the scene.

768
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:22,560
Swat team alpha, we need to set up a roadblock

769
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,031
At the fairfax county line.

770
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:26,030
Dc metro's covering the district line in case he tries

771
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,101
- To double back.- Copy that. County line.

772
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:35,231
Sir.

773
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:37,300
I have a visual.

774
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:39,533
Yeah. got him.

775
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:47,602
Send us lower.

776
00:38:54,737 --> 00:38:56,602
Yeah, he's pulling off the road. get us down there now.

777
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,031
Renee, it's larry. suspect is on foot.

778
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,363
We can't wait for backup.

779
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:04,661
We're moving in right now.

780
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:06,501
All right. swat team's a few minutes out.

781
00:39:06,565 --> 00:39:08,460
- Careful, larry. - Yeah.

782
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:11,702
Remember, suspect has a canister,

783
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:12,862
So pic your shots.

784
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:14,303
If possible, let's take him alive.

785
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:15,562
Yes, sir.

786
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:23,833
We got to get out of here.

787
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,201
Almeida, cover. let's go.

788
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:27,262
Come on!

789
00:39:56,656 --> 00:39:57,462
Sir, relax.

790
00:39:58,686 --> 00:39:59,633
Relax.

791
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:01,060
- I'm okay. - Relax.

792
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:07,003
- Swallow. - Tony.

793
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:09,432
Tony!

794
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:12,102
Tony!

795
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:21,331
What...?

796
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:24,231
I'm sorry, larry.

797
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:26,431
Oh... god...

798
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:17,963
Let me see it.

799
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,701
How the hell do we get out of here?

800
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,632
I want you to take this, find a place to hide.

801
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,431
- Wait for my call. - What about you?

802
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:48,901
I'm gonna wait on the FBI,

803
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,261
Figure out a way to get you out of here.

804
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:52,503
Go!
