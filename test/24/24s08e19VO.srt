3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,682
The Russian people join you
in mourning President Hassan.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,400
We both know the opposition
that undid him had outside help.

5
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,648
I just got off the phone
with the Russian foreign minister.

6
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,817
<i>He said that he would be coming
to the United Nations in five hours</i>

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,279
with the Russian premier
to sign the treaty as scheduled.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,597
The credit for that is all yours.

9
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:34,909
It's good to be back in the game.

10
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:37,005
Elements
inside the Russian government

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,690
were behind both the assassination
of President Hassan

12
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:43,191
and the supply
of nuclear material to his enemies.

13
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,711
The Russian government?

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,422
The Russians inserted
Dana Walsh at CTU months ago.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,654
She was their agent.

16
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,387
If Bauer gets to her,
this will all be finished.

17
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,255
I want to know
who killed Renee Walker.

18
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,353
Renee's dead? I'm sorry.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,710
You're sorry?

20
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:05,864
- I can give you the hitter.
- I want more than names, I want proof!

21
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,139
I have proof.

22
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:09,657
An audio file.

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,570
Film.

24
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:14,407
- Where?
- First I want my immunity deal back.

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,075
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,035
I won't give her immunity.

27
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:20,902
I believe she knows
the names of the people who facilitated

28
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:22,643
the assassination
of President Hassan,

29
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:25,150
people working
within the Russian government.

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,752
I won't allow it.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,379
You don't want to know the truth.

32
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,632
What I want is to keep
the Russians at the table.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,009
Allegations of this sort
will drive them away.

34
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:38,514
I've arranged a helicopter to fly you
from CTU to McGuire Air Force Base.

35
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:41,090
You're locking me down.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,082
I'm taking this helicopter.
Tell your men to drop their weapons

37
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:46,355
or you're gonna die.

38
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,483
Out of the copter now!

39
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,194
All security to the helipad.
Security to the helipad now.

40
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,280
Call the FAA, Air Force,

41
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,116
say that we have a stolen helicopter
that needs to be forced down.

42
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:04,341


43
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,767
<i>Jack, it's Chloe.</i>

44
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:12,047
<i>What are you doing?</i>

45
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:13,837
Talk to me.

46
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:16,857
<i>Talk to me.</i>

47
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,054
- Can you hear me?
- He can hear you.

48
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:21,682
Comm's on, he's just not answering.

49
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,680
Damn it.

50
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,767
Air Force choppers
are closing in on his position.

51
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:38,449
<i>Mr. Bauer, you are ordered</i>

52
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,452
<i>to turn the aircraft around
and return to CTU.</i>

53
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>I repeat,
turn the aircraft around now.</i>

54
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,521
Jack's descending.

55
00:02:57,646 --> 00:02:59,303
Air Force choppers are in pursuit.

56
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:02,431
<i>This is crazy.
Come back to CTU.</i>

57
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:20,491
<i>NYPD, this is Ranger One.</i>

58
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:23,077
<i>Suspect just landed
on the Cooper Building.</i>

59
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,329
<i>We're gonna circle
and maintain visual contact.</i>

60
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,519
<i>We have a visual on NYPD.</i>

61
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,564
<i>Two units approaching the building.
They're one block out.</i>

62
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:02,366
<i>Suspect's on the fire escape.</i>

63
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,993
<i>He's descending to ground level.</i>

64
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,352
<i>We've lost him.
Attempting to reacquire.</i>

65
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,332
Dispatch, this is unit 27.

66
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:55,513
We're at the building,
but we've lost the suspect.

67
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:57,253
<i>Copy. We'll widen the perimeter.</i>

68
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:05,971
What is Jack doing?

69
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,806
He's not letting this go.

70
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,976
Dana has proof about the Russians.
He'll probably come after her.

71
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,562
That's crazy. She's locked down.
Jack knows he can't get to her.

72
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:17,405
He'll either figure it out
or he'll die trying.

73
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,610
Go on the field.

74
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:22,216
Meet with NYPD
and coordinate an interagency search.

75
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,989
Bring in whoever you need.

76
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,624
Use satellite and traffic cam.
Maybe we can track him from here.

77
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:28,749
On it.

78
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,120
Keep me looped in
on the search status.

79
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:43,592
No, I don't want to be
updated in ten minutes.

80
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,199
I want a real-time uplink.

81
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:54,019
They still haven't been able
to lock Jack down.

82
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,397
They lost him. He landed the chopper
and escaped on foot.

83
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,366
NYPD is securing a perimeter.

84
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:02,486
CTU is coordinating
an interagency search.

85
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,614
If Jack gets this evidence
and exposes the Russians,

86
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,382
the agreement is over.

87
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:10,326
The peace agreement
may not be the only casualty.

88
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:17,715
You covered up
the Russians' involvement.

89
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,389
That's grounds for impeachment.

90
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:23,301
Possibly a criminal indictment.

91
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:27,386
You crossed a line.

92
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,098
But it may not be too late

93
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,267
to step back and limit the damage.

94
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,771
- How?
- Expose the Russians.

95
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,260
Grant Dana Walsh immunity
in exchange for evidence.

96
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,043
We'll launch an investigation through
transparent international channels.

97
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,655
Which will effectively end

98
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:50,325
- the peace deal.
- But it will save your administration.

99
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:54,663
There is still a chance

100
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,176
CTU will find Jack.

101
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:59,334
Even if they do,
the evidence is still out there.

102
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,087
Eventually, it will surface.

103
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,809
I know better than anyone
how much this means to you.

104
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,437
How much you've sacrificed

105
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:20,535
personally

106
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:22,353
to make it happen.

107
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,736
We are so close.

108
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,454
And we will be again.

109
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,740
If not during your administration,

110
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,881
then during the next one.

111
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:36,997
I wish I could believe that.

112
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,635
Ethan, I want you to prepare...

113
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:52,594
a statement

114
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,015
announcing our withdrawal

115
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,533
from this accord.

116
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:58,496
We have a...

117
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,408
a press conference in 40 minutes.
I'll make the announcement then.

118
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,841
As hard as this is,

119
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:11,163
you're doing the right thing.

120
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,475
It's over.

121
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,839
I won't go through
with the peace deal.

122
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:10,591
Because of Bauer.

123
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,117
Because the evidence
implicating the Russians,

124
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:16,263
that I helped cover up.
It is potentially too lethal.

125
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:17,996
I agree.

126
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,146
Doesn't sound
like you have much of a choice.

127
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,062
I'm surprised.

128
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,336
I expected more of a fight from you.

129
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:28,190
I'm nothing if not pragmatic.

130
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,069
Although I am disappointed.

131
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:35,580
I'm afraid you have to find
some other way to repair your legacy.

132
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:38,911
My own personal
disappointment aside,

133
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,171
it's a loss for the world.

134
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:42,599
Yes, it is.

135
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,086
Ethan's drafting my statement.

136
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:50,297
I need to call Mrs. Hassan.

137
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:54,009
Hope she'll forgive me,

138
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,802
for keeping the truth from her.

139
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,430
Before, there is one thing
you might consider.

140
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
A way to preserve the peace deal.

141
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,144
The peace deal is over.

142
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,229
You said so.

143
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,232
I said it was over,
if the evidence comes out.

144
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,444
Obviously,
you can't grant Walsh immunity.

145
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,179
The evidence
would become public record.

146
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,825
You need to control the evidence
by keeping Walsh off the grid.

147
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:20,160
Off the grid?

148
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,579
Classify her as an enemy combatant,

149
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,122
and incarcerate her.

150
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,751
There is a private firm
I can recommend.

151
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,050
They're effective

152
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,255
and discreet.

153
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:34,054
I have them standing by.

154
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,689
Sounds like you've been giving this
a lot of thought.

155
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,409
This evidence
is hanging over your head.

156
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:45,936
You need to deal with it.

157
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,880
We can't keep Walsh
locked up indefinitely.

158
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,315
You wouldn't have to.

159
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,487
Ms. Walsh may not give up
the information willingly,

160
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:56,571
but she will give it up.

161
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,674
And once we have it,

162
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,743
it won't matter what she claims.

163
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,247
You're talking
about using physical coercion.

164
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,204
I know how deeply this offends,

165
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,585
your public and private sensibilities.
It is repugnant,

166
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,348
even immoral.

167
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:17,592
But isn't morality relative,
considering what's at stake here?

168
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:21,305
You are still talking about torture.

169
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,481
I'm talking
about preserving a peace accord

170
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:25,642
that is crucial
to the security of this nation.

171
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,686
And that can only happen,

172
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,063
if you acquire
and control the evidence.

173
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,960
Believe me,
I don't make these suggestions lightly.

174
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:37,779
I appreciate the implications.

175
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:40,298
I've tried to be as open
and candid with you,

176
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:41,742
as I've been with anyone.

177
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:43,878
And the truth is, I regret

178
00:11:44,806 --> 00:11:46,955
many of my own actions
when I was president.

179
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,041
But I've also had the time
and the distance

180
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,213
to see past them to a place of clear
and deep understanding.

181
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,760
What do you understand?

182
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,652
Wielding the kind of power
that I once had and you have now,

183
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:01,970
can change the world.

184
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,177
But that often requires making

185
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,832
impossible choices

186
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:08,935
that challenge
our most sacred ideals.

187
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,096
If you're not willing to do that,

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
you should take Ethan's advice,

189
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,608
and pull out now.

190
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,211
This was taken eight minutes ago

191
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,458
on the corner of 25th and Cleveland.

192
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,968
Give Cole this information,
have him redirect his search.

193
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:45,347
The President's calling for you.

194
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:46,922
Put her through.

195
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,978
Have you made any progress
in finding Jack Bauer?

196
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,688
Not yet. We're still searching.

197
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,481
I think it's safe to assume
he's on his way to CTU

198
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,924
and that Dana Walsh is his target.

199
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,904
That's why I'm calling.

200
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:04,408
I want Walsh transferred
to a safe house off-site.

201
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:08,597
I've doubled the security
around Dana Walsh.

202
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,872
This is the safest place
for her to be.

203
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:14,800
Your opinion notwithstanding,
I'd feel more comfortable,

204
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,421
with her in a place
where she can't be tracked.

205
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:20,891
Agents from a private security firm,

206
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,467
are coming to pick her up.

207
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,587
A private security firm?

208
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:28,213
You know as well as I do
that Jack has contacts,

209
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:30,016
throughout the government,

210
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,995
some of whom might be sympathetic
to his situation.

211
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm not suggesting
that you're one of those people.

212
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:42,180
<i>I just want to take
every precaution.</i>

213
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,783
I'm sending over
the transfer order now.

214
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,950
The agent in charge
of the escort team

215
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,021
is named Mark Bledsoe.

216
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,389
Should be arriving in a few minutes.

217
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:54,564
Understood.

218
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,251
Thank you.

219
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:00,589
I know this was difficult,

220
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,716
but you did well.

221
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:06,443
These men of yours,
I want them to use

222
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,054
every method of non-coercive

223
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,387
interrogation available to them.

224
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,625
I've already given
that standing order.

225
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:14,603
No one wants this to get ugly.

226
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,116
It's already ugly.

227
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,355
Thanks.
I don't need the chargers.

228
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:41,046
Chloe, it's Jack.

229
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,824
Please, come back now.
This has got to stop.

230
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,968
I need you to get me access
to Dana Walsh.

231
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,179
The President said she's lying.

232
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,623
It's the President who's lying,
to protect the peace agreement.

233
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,976
Even if she is,
she must have good reason.

234
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,646
Besides, it's not your call,
it's the President's.

235
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,538
She's covering up the terrorist attack.
She no longer has the call.

236
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,277
You don't want to go against me.

237
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,655
Are you threatening me?

238
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,574
I'm trying to ask you for help.

239
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,396
Put me in a room with Dana Walsh.

240
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,736
You're being hunted
by every law enforcement agency.

241
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,163
You're not thinking clearly.

242
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,916
I'm the only one who is.

243
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,377
You can't just go against everyone.

244
00:15:20,743 --> 00:15:23,046
Please, just come in here,
and we'll figure this out

245
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:25,097
before you get yourself killed.

246
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:27,331
Forget it.
I'll figure out another way.

247
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:28,545
Wait.

248
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,670
What?

249
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:36,309
If you do get the evidence from Dana,
what are you gonna do?

250
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,815
I want the people who are responsible,
to be held accountable.

251
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:44,234
All I need to do is expose them.

252
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:51,783
The President's having her
transferred out of CTU.

253
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:53,627
Why?

254
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,061
I'm not sure.
She hired a private security firm.

255
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:58,498
- Where are they taking her?
- I don't know.

256
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,375
Find out.
I'll call you back.

257
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:04,963
Okay. I will.

258
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:06,283
Thanks.

259
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,116
Yes?

260
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,534
Jim, it's Jack Bauer.

261
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,706
Heard you got
the whole damn city after you.

262
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:42,375
I need your help.
I'm running out of places to go.

263
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:43,805
Running out?

264
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,129
I'd say gone.

265
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,610
- What'd you do this time?
- The less you know, the better.

266
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,259
- For who?
- For both of us.

267
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,887
I'm gonna need weapons and equipment.
Can you make that happen?

268
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,849
I can make just about anything happen.
You already know that.

269
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:00,477
The problem is
that you're a walking bull's-eye.

270
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:03,431
Last thing in the world I need
is you on my doorstep.

271
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,465
You wouldn't have one
if it wasn't for me.

272
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,104
I'm calling in a favor.

273
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:10,354
I'll tell you what I want, and I want
it ready when I get there. Okay?

274
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:13,239
Well, I see you haven't lost
your personal touch.

275
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,327
I'm gonna need a comm unit, two MP5s,
an assortment of assault rifles

276
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,496
<i>and body armor.
Hold on a second.</i>

277
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,791
<i>I also need
a full surveillance package.</i>

278
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,764
It's me. We're at CTU.

279
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,345
- You have Walsh?
- Not yet.

280
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,585
I wanted
to talk about something before.

281
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,312
- Is there a problem?
- We quickly put this team together,

282
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,100
and we didn't discuss what to do
once we've extracted the information.

283
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:49,417
Hand her back to CTU.

284
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,319
Without the evidence,
she's harmless.

285
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,698
Even without it, she can make
accusations that might stick.

286
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,158
- <i>You can't afford that.</i>
- What are you suggesting?

287
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:01,240
We can make it look like she was killed
while she was trying to escape.

288
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:02,618
Wouldn't be difficult.

289
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:04,541
We're not willing
to go down that path.

290
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:08,293
You hired me to clean up this situation.
That's what needs to happen.

291
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:11,297
Talk it over with the client,
but I need to know soon.

292
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:13,392
Sir?

293
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:14,968
Yes, okay, I'll let you know.

294
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,773
Mr. Bledsoe?
Chloe O'Brian, acting director of CTU.

295
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,029
- Heard you've had a rough day.
- Yeah, you could say that.

296
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,238
- I'll take you to Dana Walsh.
- Thank you.

297
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,863
- Where are you taking her?
- I can't disclose that information.

298
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:40,559
The whole point of this exercise
is to keep Walsh off the grid.

299
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,728
Yes, but I'm responsible
for this prisoner.

300
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:45,290
You were given a presidential order
to turn over the prisoner.

301
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,041
I'm gonna need to see that order.

302
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,918
You should've received it already.

303
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:52,338
We didn't. Like you said, we've had
a rough day. We were hit by an EMP

304
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,048
and our systems are still down.

305
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,675
We don't have a lot of time.

306
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,887
Look, I can't let you take her
unless I see the order.

307
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,305
So, you can wait.

308
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,890
Might take an hour or more.

309
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,801
Thank you.
I'm sorry to be so by-the-book.

310
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:15,481
I was just promoted,

311
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:18,545
and I just want to make sure
that I dot all my I's and cross the T's.

312
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,902
- Satisfied?
- Yeah, great.

313
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,613
Good morning, Ms. Walsh.
My name is Mark Bledsoe.

314
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:37,300
The president's ordered your transfer
to an off-site facility.

315
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,428
You've been designated an enemy
combatant by special executive order.

316
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:43,097
What do you mean off-site facility?

317
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,766
It's a secure location.

318
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,435
Chloe, what the hell is going on?
Where's Bauer?

319
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,812
Where's my deal?

320
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,188
Just do what he says.

321
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,393
We can do it the hard way
or the easy way.

322
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:55,443
- But you're leaving here with us.
- Don't let them do this. Please.

323
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:56,945
They'll kill me.

324
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,072
Chloe, please.

325
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,650
Thank you for your cooperation.

326
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,386
Let's get units
on these two intersections.

327
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,547
Check anyone passing through.

328
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:51,249
I'll ask Transit Police
to lock down these subways.

329
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,254
Chloe, we're still searching.
No sign of Jack.

330
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:57,922
He just called me.

331
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,702
- What?
- He wants me to help him get to Dana.

332
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,803
- What did you tell him?
- That she's being transferred

333
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,513
and I would give him the address.

334
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:07,099
<i>And I almost did.</i>

335
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,226
But I can't.
I'm under presidential orders.

336
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:12,312
Besides, I don't think he's right.

337
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:14,439
He's not thinking clearly.

338
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,609
We have to find him
before he gets himself killed.

339
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:21,463
What if Jack is thinking clearly?

340
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:24,348
If he's right, if the president's lying,
and this conspiracy is real,

341
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,276
we might be
on the wrong side of this.

342
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,731
Bottom line is, we were given orders
to bring him in.

343
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:31,247
- That's what we're gonna do.
- All right.

344
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:46,271
I need everyone's attention, please.

345
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:50,058
We're mobilizing a sting operation
in the field to be led by Agent Ortiz.

346
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,185
The target is Jack Bauer.

347
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:57,106
Let's get to work.

348
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:34,239
Did you get what I need?

349
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:36,729
Nice to see you again, too, Jack.

350
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,775
- Did you get it or not?
- Yeah, it's right over there.

351
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:46,823
Everything you asked for...
right there.

352
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,827
I've been checking the scanners.

353
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,745
All the agencies
are looking for you.

354
00:22:53,032 --> 00:22:54,715
But nobody will say what you did.

355
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,528
It's not about what I did.

356
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:59,152
They're afraid of what I'm gonna do.

357
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:03,009
I don't know what they did to you,
but it must have be pretty bad.

358
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:05,375
I got to make a phone call.

359
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,889
It's me. You find out
where they're taking Dana?

360
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,392
Think about what you're doing.

361
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,301
Just give me the address.

362
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:19,772
- It's not too late to turn yourself in.
- Will you give me the address or not?

363
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:28,458
Dana is being taken to a safe house
in the Middle Village.

364
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,492
It's an industrial laundry
at 141 Juniper Valley Road.

365
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,330
That's about ten minutes from here.
I'll leave now.

366
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,584
Call me when you arrive. I'm working
on pulling up the interior specs.

367
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,084
I'll be able to guide you in.

368
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:43,629
Chloe, thanks.
I know I've put you in a spot.

369
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,384
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

370
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:55,617
I might need you later.

371
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:57,268
You can't come back here again.

372
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,104
- Besides that, we're even now.
- I'll let you know when we're even.

373
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,746
Jim, please.

374
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:06,027
I need your help, okay?

375
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,373
O'Brian briefed you?

376
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,311
We're drawing Bauer to this location
where he thinks Dana is being held.

377
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:24,837
It's an industrial laundry
the DEA seized a year ago.

378
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,882
CTU's been using it as a safe house,
but Jack can't know this.

379
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:30,095
Bauer's a highly skilled operative.

380
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,053
Make everything
as credible as possible.

381
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:34,013
He'll be expecting sentries,
so Beck,

382
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,182
you're out front.
Greer, you take the back.

383
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,955
You two will be stationed inside.

384
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,812
Everyone stays out of sight
until Jack's between our choke points.

385
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,314
We do the takedown when,
and only when I give the order.

386
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:45,053
We get this right,

387
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,777
we take Jack by surprise
before he has a chance to fight back.

388
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:49,173
Gear up.

389
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,702
Jack's ten minutes out.

390
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:53,950
- What's your status?
- We're getting ready on site.

391
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,758
Remember, non-lethal force.

392
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,704
I don't want to hurt him either,

393
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,789
but I can't tell my men not to defend
themselves if they are in danger.

394
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,114
You know that.

395
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:06,884
He's calling me when he arrives.
I'll let you know when that happens.

396
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,009
All right.

397
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,763
Let's go, guys, let's go.

398
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,623
I have a final draft
of your statement.

399
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,294
I think it best for now to...

400
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,689
cite President Hassan's death,
as the reason for your withdrawing.

401
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:27,437
Then after the dust has settled,

402
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:29,944
we can start prosecuting the Russians
through back channels.

403
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:34,936
I've chosen not to withdraw.

404
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,662
And I'm keeping
the press conference as scheduled.

405
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:41,998
I don't understand.

406
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:46,363
Dana Walsh is being moved from CTU
to a private detention facility.

407
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:49,703
She'll be off the grid,
out of Jack Bauer's reach.

408
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:55,449
I've authorized
a private interrogation team

409
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,124
to acquire the evidence.

410
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:01,017
Acquire the evidence?

411
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,727
Once we have it, she'll be irlevant.

412
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:07,773
Keeping the truth from Bauer
is one thing...

413
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,164
but authorizing the illegal detention
and torture of a prisoner?

414
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:15,217
How far are you willing to go
to protect this lie?

415
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:18,477
As far as necessary
to preserve this treaty.

416
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,910
It's vital to the security
of this nation.

417
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:24,986
And what I am doing
is for the greater good.

418
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:29,462
This was Logan's idea.

419
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:32,656
The decision was mine.

420
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,932
And I stand behind it.

421
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,475
Please listen to what I'm saying.
I think this is about

422
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,170
more than the greater good.

423
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:47,003
I think your presidency

424
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:49,928
has cost you your marriage
and your children.

425
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:52,097
And you think that this treaty

426
00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:55,506
- will somehow redeem that loss...
- Ethan, that's enough.

427
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:57,431
You've made this personal,

428
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:58,950
and you've lost your way.

429
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,369
I've known you long enough
to see that.

430
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,797
I implore you...

431
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,017
take a step back,
look at this clearly.

432
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,167
That's enough.

433
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:11,337
I've explained my reasons.

434
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:15,011
I appreciate your objections,
but the debate is over.

435
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,429
So, let's move on.

436
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,184
Unless you stop
what's being done in your name,

437
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:36,994
I can't be a part
of this any longer.

438
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,289
Don't worry, I'll keep it to myself.

439
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:44,007
I'll cite my health
as the reason for my resignation.

440
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:47,290
After all, I'm... here
against doctor's orders.

441
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:49,841
Please.

442
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,753
We are almost there!

443
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,548
You can't just abandon me like this.

444
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,508
I'm not abandoning you.

445
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:01,512
I'm listening to my conscience.

446
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:04,459
Anyway,

447
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:06,698
you've got Charles Logan now.

448
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,562
Only room for one of us.

449
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:13,912
Madam President.

450
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,380
Look at me.
My hand is shaking.

451
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:38,952
I would be concerned if it weren't.

452
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:42,219
What you've agreed to take on is not
something that could be treated lightly.

453
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:46,186
I keep thinking that people
will accuse me of grabbing for power.

454
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,768
Exploiting my husband's death.

455
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:51,437
Which couldn't be
further from the truth.

456
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,565
Still, some people
may perceive it that way.

457
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:56,587
Remember what father said?

458
00:28:58,857 --> 00:29:00,029
He said the best way

459
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,647
to dispel public misperception
is to address it directly.

460
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:07,661
Good.

461
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:09,988
I will take his advice.

462
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:13,626
Jamot, will you excuse us?

463
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:14,794
Of course.

464
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,463
I just need to remind you
that the other delegates

465
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,531
are expecting you in 20 minutes.

466
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:21,035
I'll be ready.

467
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:30,935
Mother, I'm sorry
for being so selfish earlier.

468
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:32,436
You were afraid.

469
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,922
You lost your father today.

470
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,357
And you were afraid
of losing me as well.

471
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:40,742
I still am.

472
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:49,373
This peace agreement,
Father died for...

473
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:52,728
How can so many people be
so violently against it?

474
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,790
Some people are so invested
in their fear and hatred that...

475
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:03,845
peace is the most threatening thing
they can imagine.

476
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,083
- Chloe, you still there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

477
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,375
I'm at the site.

478
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,438
- I only see one man out front.
- I found a schematic of the building.

479
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:35,958
There's a side entrance
to the north of the loading dock.

480
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,085
I got it.

481
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:41,163
It looks like
it's out of the sentry's line of sight.

482
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:44,982
According to the schematic, there's
an enclosed room at the SW corner.

483
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:48,345
- That's where they must keeping her.
- Copy that. I got go. I'm moving in.

484
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:14,330
He's going into the dock entrance
heading towards the takedown point.

485
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:16,733
I see him.

486
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,379
He's moving into the building
and headed towards you.

487
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,256
- Stay sharp.
- Copy that. We're ready.

488
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:29,289
I got a visual on the room.

489
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,656
No hostiles in sight.

490
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,284
- I'm going to try and grab her.
- Be careful, Jack.

491
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,960
Okay, copy that.

492
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:56,003
He's almost at the takedown point.

493
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:57,808
Copy that.
On my way.

494
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,935
Hopkins, we're moving in.

495
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:30,841
Son of a bitch.

496
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:44,246
Put your weapons down!

497
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:45,939
Put your weapons down now!

498
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,316
I can't do that!

499
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:49,276
If you don't, I'll kill him!

500
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:50,986
Put that gun down now!

501
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,738
Put your weapons down now!

502
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,130
Now!

503
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,308
Put 'em down!

504
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,205
Tell them to get down.

505
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:03,262
- Do it.
- Get on the ground.

506
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:04,416
Now!

507
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,710
Cole, slowly advance towards me.

508
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:12,199
Kick the guns over in my direction.

509
00:34:17,218 --> 00:34:18,764
Get out of my line of sight.

510
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:20,224
How did you know?

511
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:22,446
I know Chloe.

512
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:24,395
You're gonna call CTU.

513
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,648
You're gonna tell her you've got me
locked down and ready for transport.

514
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:29,692
Put it on speaker.

515
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:35,864
It's Cole.

516
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,574
Go ahead.
What's happening?

517
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,201
We've got Jack. He's locked down.

518
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:41,370
- Is he okay?
- <i>He's fine.</i>

519
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,734
- What about your men?
- They're all right.

520
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,378
I know I should feel relieved,
but I just feel worse.

521
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,296
Like you said, Chloe,

522
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,722
it's for his own good.

523
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:55,777
I'll talk to him when he gets here.

524
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,474
- Lock your men down.
- What are your plans?

525
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,600
Lock 'em down!

526
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:25,414
All right,

527
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,332
- what now?
- Follow me.

528
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:36,587
Take a seat.

529
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:43,807
You're why I'm here.
I knew Chloe would send you.

530
00:35:44,538 --> 00:35:47,230
- You're the only reason I risked it.
- What do you want with me?

531
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:49,229
Help me gain access to Dana Walsh.

532
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,858
I know that you don't want to be a part
of this cover-up.

533
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,866
President Taylor
wants the peace agreement so badly,

534
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:59,452
she's willing to lie about the Russian's
involvement in the attack,

535
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,139
and I can't let that happen.

536
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:03,152
How can you be sure?

537
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,412
Because she told me to my face!

538
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:08,540
She said it was more important
than anything the Russians have done.

539
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,168
Why the hell do you think
she came down to CTU to talk to me?

540
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:13,378
She didn't want me
to give the evidence.

541
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,714
She wanted to shut me up
and lock me down.

542
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:18,661
Damn it,
your hands aren't clean in this.

543
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:21,470
You protected Dana while
she was operating for the Russians.

544
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,968
You lied for her,
which enabled the Russians

545
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:26,487
to provide nuclear materials
to Hassan's opposition.

546
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:29,316
They facilitated his assassination
and what,

547
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:30,687
you lost four men?

548
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:33,065
I am giving you an opportunity
to fix it,

549
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:36,443
to make the people that are responsible
for today's events accountable.

550
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:42,122
You got a decision to make.

551
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:44,583
- Now, what if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

552
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:53,544
I can't do this on my own.

553
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,592
Your call.

554
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:14,940
Chloe says she's in a safe house
a few miles from here.

555
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:18,254
We'll notify CTU about your men
within the next two hours.

556
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,779
Right now it's imperative
that they think I took you hostage.

557
00:37:22,122 --> 00:37:22,864
Get up!

558
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,230
<i>We've been hearing speculation
that Dalia Hassan will be making</i>

559
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:35,294
<i>her first official statement
as the provisional head of state</i>

560
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,296
<i>of the Islamic Republic
of Kamistan. </i>

561
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:39,957
<i>Earlier, we spoke to a UN official
who confirmed</i>

562
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:42,360
<i>that under the IRK's constitution,</i>

563
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:44,052
<i>Mrs. Hassan would have the authority</i>

564
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,826
<i>to sign this treaty.</i>

565
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,684
I heard about your resignation.

566
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,895
I'm glad to see
you're putting your health first.

567
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:55,832
We all just want you to get well.

568
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:58,914
I'm leaving because of you.

569
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,487
Because of what you've started here.

570
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:06,118
You've deliberately played this out

571
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,410
to maneuver the President
into a corner.

572
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:13,415
I brought the Russians
back to the table.

573
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,584
But you didn't tell her
how you were doing it.

574
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,002
She didn't ask.

575
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:20,881
Because she knew it was best for her
to preserve her own deniability.

576
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,967
The President knows
exactly what she's doing.

577
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,163
She's smart.

578
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:28,305
She's smarter than either of us
ever gave her credit for.

579
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,473
I see.

580
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:34,221
- You just provided counsel.
- That's right.

581
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:37,038
Well, let me counsel you.

582
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,443
Stop this cover-up
before it's too late.

583
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,737
This peace is no good.

584
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:46,924
There's too much blood on this treaty
for it ever to hold.

585
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,455
We've both been in this game
a long time,

586
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,111
and we both know damn well

587
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:53,956
that every treaty ever written
had blood on it!

588
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,324
Not like this.

589
00:38:56,513 --> 00:38:58,334
You got Allison
so far into the woods,

590
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,295
she'll never be able
to find her way out.

591
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,418
She wasn't like you.

592
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,968
Wasn't like any politician
I've ever known.

593
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,593
That's right.

594
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,947
She's finally got some teeth.

595
00:39:10,072 --> 00:39:11,264
You listen to me.

596
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:13,768
If she suffers for this,

597
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:17,341
I will come after you
with everything I have.

598
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:20,711
- You're threatening me.
- I'm warning you, Charles.

599
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:23,944
Do you need to sit down?

600
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:26,905
I'm fine.

601
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:31,283
If you don't mind, Allison will be
taking the podium any second now.

602
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:35,622
Get some rest, Ethan.

603
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,890
You need it.

604
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,117
You told Bauer you have evidence.

605
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:14,691
I need to know where it is.

606
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:15,912
Come on.

607
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,957
You know the deal. The sooner
you tell me, the easier it'll go.

608
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,650
Please,

609
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:24,963
I have got nothing to tell you.
There is no evidence.

610
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,383
If that's the way
you want to play it, fine.

611
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,441
Ladies and gentlemen,

612
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:40,742
no questions will be taken
until after this morning's address.

613
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,902
I want to thank you
for your thoughts on my speech.

614
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,533
They were very helpful.

615
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:49,988
I'm glad.

616
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,866
My husband would have been grateful
for the support

617
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,684
that you have given me.

618
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Thank you.

619
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:02,129
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

620
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:11,426
My fellow Americans
and friends in foreign lands,

621
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:14,471
I speak to you this morning
with a heavy heart.

622
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:18,384
The brutal and cowardly murder
of President Omar Hassan

623
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:22,012
was a blow to every civilized person
in the world

624
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,734
and a stark reminder
that the pursuit of peace

625
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:27,526
sometimes comes with a steep price.

626
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,384
President Hassan understood that,

627
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,630
yet still had the fortitude

628
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,906
to pursue a better tomorrow
against so many odds.

629
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,578
I join with the American people

630
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:40,412
in mourning him

631
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:41,998
and every other innocent life

632
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,750
that was lost during this crisis.

633
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,254
But let it be known here and now

634
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,812
their sacrifice
will not have been in vain.

635
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,471
Peace must and will prevail
no matter the cost.

636
00:42:02,878 --> 00:42:07,116
No matter the cost,
no matter the compromises.

637
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:10,359
We have waited too long
and worked too hard,

638
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,985
to allow this opportunity
to pass us by.

639
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,949
And that is why
in Omar Hassan's name,

640
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,619
I am choosing to move forward
with this historic summit.

641
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:22,740
<i>One that was made possible
by the shared hopes and ideals</i>

642
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:24,198
<i>of the IRK leadership,</i>

643
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,128
<i>and will continue
under its new leader...</i>

644
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,064
a woman of unparalleled courage

645
00:42:31,189 --> 00:42:32,189
and grace,

646
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:35,241
who has been chosen by her people

647
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:38,680
to carry on the mantle
of her late husband...
