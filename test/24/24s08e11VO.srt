3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,999
Cole, he's dead.
Just go.

4
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:17,933
Nobody knows you're involved.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,577
I don't want you involved.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,354
I'm already involved.

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,023
We're cleaning this up,
and no one will ever know.

8
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,234
They're scum,

9
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:29,278
and no one's gonna miss 'em.

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,980
Kayla may be in danger.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,148
<i>She's run away.</i>

12
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,240
With Tarin.

13
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:34,834
She's somewhere in the city

14
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:37,053
<i>with no idea
that a nuclear threat exists.</i>

15
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:38,245
What about you?

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,789
Don't worry about me.

17
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,816
Just help me find our daughter.

18
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:43,672
Come inside.

19
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:49,715
- They have the rods.
- I thought you had the rods.

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,264
They turned against me.

21
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,169
I can help you find them.

22
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,512
Get me out of here.

23
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,139
- You find Farhad?
- Still looking.

24
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:58,349
He won't get far.

25
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:05,487
Medic! Come on!

26
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,733
I need you to identify the men
who stole the rods.

27
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,647
- Can you do that for us?
- Yes.

28
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:12,492
Blood pressure's dropping.
We got a rapid heartbeat.

29
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,191
- We lost him. Farhad's dead.
- Damn it!

30
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,610
Whoever shot him
couldn't confirm that he was killed.

31
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,245
We can use him as dead bait.

32
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,081
Leak it to the press
that he's in custody and he survived,

33
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,654
they'll have to make a move.

34
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,377
Tell the teams it is imperative
that we take them alive.

35
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,382
Go! Go!

36
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:35,044
It's all right.
We just want to talk to you.

37
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,727
He's still moving.
Notify the perimeter.

38
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,660
It was a trap.
Farhad was already dead.

39
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,659
I locked myself in an oxygen chamber.
They can't get in here.

40
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,246
- You know what you must do.
- They scrambled the arming code.

41
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,708
You need to set it off manually.
You cannot let them take you alive.

42
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:09,795
Can you hear me?

43
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:44,446
What's the status?

44
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,332
The hyperbaric chamber
is one-inch steel.

45
00:02:46,678 --> 00:02:49,119
Hermetically sealed,
air and power systems are internal.

46
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:51,261
Also, its atmosphere
is most likely oxygen-enriched.

47
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:53,631
Anything we use to blow the door
could ignite a fire inside.

48
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,751
- How long will it take to cut in?
- We need to use a low-speed drill.

49
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,676
How long?

50
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,804
Best estimate... 40 minutes,
unless you want us

51
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,515
- to push the risk.
- We can't. We need him alive.

52
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,226
The techs have got the cameras online.
We have eyes on him.

53
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,382
And the intercom?

54
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:08,841
It's still down from when
he shorted out the locking mechanism.

55
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:11,077
And the bomb techs say
we have a bigger problem.

56
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,873
They assumed that once we jammed
the signal to the detonator,

57
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,911
it'd be impossible
to explode the vest.

58
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,605
Turns out that may not be the case.

59
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,482
He's reconfiguring the circuits.

60
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:22,159
The detonator's German military,
so our guys are familiar with it.

61
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,545
The end-around
he's sketched out here will work.

62
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,872
- What's the timeframe?
- It depends on how fast he works.

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,749
He needs to reset four circuits.

64
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,419
That LED light indicates
he's already completed one.

65
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,448
When he wires the other three, he'll
be able to explode the device at will.

66
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,204
The chamber will contain the blast.

67
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,632
- No one else will be hurt.
- He's not trying to hurt anybody.

68
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:41,715
He's trying to make sure
we don't take him alive.

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,878
Get that intercom up and running.
I need to talk to him asap.

70
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:46,681
This is Bauer.
Let me speak to Hastings.

71
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:47,768
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

72
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,106
<i>Mr. Hastings,
Jack Bauer on the line.</i>

73
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:54,455
What have you got?

74
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,114
<i>Our suspect might be able
to get the detonator working</i>

75
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,988
<i>before we can get to him.</i>

76
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,241
- I need to know everything on him.
<i>- I'm just pulling up the information.</i>

77
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:05,286
It took a while to get it
from Hassan's intelligence people.

78
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,341
- Just give me the overview.
- Okay, Marcos Al-Zacar...

79
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,124
was born here,
raised in east Harlem.

80
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:13,919
Mother's American,
father was from the IRK...

81
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,184
That's where Al-Zacar
got his politics from.

82
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:20,301
His father was a professor known to be
critical of American foreign policies,

83
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,595
suspected of connections
with extremists.

84
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,560
He was imprisoned by Wayne Palmer's
administration for four months.

85
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:29,310
Although the charges were eventually
dropped, he was unhireable after that.

86
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:32,187
Almost a year later,
he committed suicide.

87
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,024
That must have been what triggered
Al-Zacar. He started spying

88
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,734
<i>on America for the IRK</i>

89
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,903
<i>- two months after that.</i>
- What about the mother?

90
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,657
Checking current records.

91
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:43,073
According to motor vehicle
and utility records

92
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,368
she's still in east Harlem.
4211 east 117th street.

93
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,329
Get her here as soon as possible.

94
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,184
We're on it.
Keep us posted.

95
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:51,309
<i>Copy that.</i>

96
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,165
We have to assume the people
building this bomb

97
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,831
want to hit a high-value target
here in Manhattan.

98
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:58,505
They've got to get it on the island.

99
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,507
We should shut down the city?

100
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,344
We want them to make the attempt
to move the radiological materials.

101
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,429
It's our best chance
of catching them.

102
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,983
First, we have to make sure

103
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,475
that all of our radiation sensors
are strictly monitored

104
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,993
at all crossings.

105
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,641
Arlo, that goes
for the drone sensors, too.

106
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:16,899
That's all.

107
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:33,540
We went over this.

108
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,804
All we have to do is act natural.
Keep our heads.

109
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:38,651
You'll be okay.

110
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:41,376
I am not worried about me.

111
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,909
You can't really be this calm
after what just happened.

112
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,930
You've never broken a law
in your life.

113
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:53,811
What should I say?

114
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,205
I don't know! Anything.
Tell me you hate me.

115
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,482
Tell me that you'll never forgive me
for lying to you.

116
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,235
- We're not doing this now. Not now!
- I told you to walk away...

117
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,009
We're in the middle of a radiological
threat. We got jobs to do.

118
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:08,588
When it's over, then we'll talk.

119
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:19,552
I can't promise things are going back
to the way they were.

120
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,290
But I wouldn't have done what I did
if I didn't still love you.

121
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:36,562
You two have holy hell
to answer for.

122
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,273
- Sir, I'm sorry. I can explain...
- Save it.

123
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:42,746
If you were following up a lead,
you should have been updating me.

124
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:43,986
You broke protocol.

125
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,155
The lead didn't pan out.
Witness was unreliable.

126
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:47,698
But there's no excuse.

127
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,158
I should have called in.

128
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:53,095
And you were supposed
to be servicing a faulty relay station.

129
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,706
Yet I see you found time
to change your clothes.

130
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,462
I don't know what's going on
with you two and, frankly, I don't care.

131
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:05,132
If we weren't at high alert,
and you weren't the best at what you do,

132
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,509
you'd both be out
on your asses for this.

133
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,286
I'm going to ask you once.

134
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,057
Whatever it is, are you finished?

135
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,475
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

136
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,351
Walsh, until further notice,

137
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,145
you will answer to Chloe O'Brian.

138
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,418
She will fill you in
on what she needs from you.

139
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,733
Bauer has a situation
at St. Julian's hospital.

140
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:24,568
I need you to assemble a team,

141
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,975
pick up an Elaine Al-Zacar
from east 117th

142
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,405
and take her to him.

143
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,449
- Is she a hostile?
- Unclear.

144
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,077
Arlo will fill you in
on the details.

145
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:34,745
How you perform

146
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,917
from this point will determine
whether or not you salvage your careers.

147
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,626
Now, get to work.

148
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,170
I'm in place.

149
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:23,544
I've managed to tap
into the hospital's security cameras.

150
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:26,131
But we can only pick up audio
in the hallway outside the room.

151
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,881
CTU has set up
a command center there.

152
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,258
Can you see Marcos?

153
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:32,052
Yes.
He's still working on the detonator.

154
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,828
Are you able to gauge his progress?

155
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:36,079
He already has
one of the four circuits reconfigured.

156
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,819
We're arriving at the landing now.

157
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,145
Soon we'll be able to transport
the rods into Manhattan.

158
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,981
Are CTU's radiation sensors down?

159
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,099
Not yet.
But we'll be ready.

160
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,527
Call me when Marcos is dead.

161
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:26,356
Port authority's reporting no hits
on the radiation sensors at the Holland,

162
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,424
midtown and Lincoln tunnels.

163
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:32,111
I don't see any stream updates
for the GW, Brooklyn, Queens Crossings.

164
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:33,279
What's the problem?

165
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:37,159
MTA's providing that feed on a dedicated
sublink to prevent a server overload.

166
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,078
You can access it yourself
on the system's Ethernet port.

167
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,034
So there's really no problem.

168
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,500
There's no way I could have known that.
You didn't put that in your hourlies.

169
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,631
Right.

170
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:48,212
I will do that next time.

171
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,606
I know this must be hard for you,
having to report to me

172
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,140
since you've been demoted.

173
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,768
It's okay, I deserved it.

174
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:04,478
Yeah, you did.

175
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:08,982
I just want you to know
I'm actually glad you didn't get

176
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,850
fired or anything and...

177
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:12,903
Hang in there.

178
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:15,656
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

179
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,513
Where are we on aerial detection?

180
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:30,545
I've got drones
covering the waterfront

181
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,965
with their radiation
detectors cranked up.

182
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:36,510
If they try to bring the fuel rods
into the city by boat, we'll spot them.

183
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,011
Easily.

184
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,715
I know you probably
hate my guts right now,

185
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,185
but I just wanted you to know
that I'm sorry.

186
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:50,023
For telling Cole
about you and that other guy.

187
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:52,359
You were definitely

188
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,778
messing up, and with the threat
of those rods...

189
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,738
Don't worry about it, Arlo.

190
00:10:58,978 --> 00:10:59,992
So is he gone?

191
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,369
Who?

192
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,537
You know.

193
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:04,913
The other guy.

194
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:08,875
He's gone.

195
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,337
So, you and the boy scout are okay?

196
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:14,715
We'll get through it.

197
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:17,264
I'm glad.

198
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,929
- But if for some reason that changes...
- I know.

199
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,056
If you ever decide
you want to trade up...

200
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,224
I got it.

201
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:53,086
We got the intercom working.
You should be able to talk to him.

202
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,174
Tell CTU I'll keep my comm up
so they can monitor.

203
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,156
<i>My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm working with CTU.</i>

204
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,533
<i>I know the original plan</i>

205
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,994
was to smuggle the rods
back to the IRK to reconstitute

206
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,762
<i>their nuclear program.</i>

207
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,581
<i>So I'm just guessing</i>

208
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:31,821
<i>that helping to deliver a bomb to NY</i>

209
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:34,372
<i>which will cost the lives
of thousands of innocent people</i>

210
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:36,254
<i>isn't exactly
what you signed on for.</i>

211
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:39,925
But the truth is if you do this,
you'll be killing the IRK.

212
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,067
<i>By bombing NY,
you're going to force president Taylor</i>

213
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:45,138
<i>to retaliate, and she will, hard.</i>

214
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,910
<i>You can't possibly want that.</i>

215
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,219
It doesn't matter what I want.

216
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,702
This so-called peace agreement,
it's just Hassan signing away

217
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:54,523
my country's ability
to defend itself,

218
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,522
<i>its independence.</i>

219
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,568
<i>He's surrendering without a fight.</i>

220
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:02,489
<i>But there are a lot of people in his own
government who are not willing to do it.</i>

221
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,200
Marcos, you can't win this fight.

222
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,859
The IRK will sustain
massive casualties because of this.

223
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,122
Because of you.

224
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,690
Not because of me.

225
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:15,010
America will be the one
dropping all the bombs.

226
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,044
<i>No, son.</i>

227
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,673
The eyes of the world will hold you
responsible for the lives taken in NY.

228
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,052
Don't think you can take
the moral high ground with me.

229
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,472
<i>The arrogance of this country.</i>

230
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:29,838
<i>That it feels it can dictate
to the rest of the world</i>

231
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:32,085
<i>who gets to have nuclear weapons,</i>

232
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,454
<i>while it insists on keeping
my people in the dark ages.</i>

233
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,441
You keep saying
"your people, your country".

234
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,719
<i>I read your file. You were born here.
You're an American citizen.</i>

235
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:43,912
<i>- Your father is from the IRK.</i>
- You leave my father out of this!

236
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:46,032
<i>What happened to him
was unfair and tragic,</i>

237
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,372
but this is no way
to honor his memory.

238
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:51,830
You can still do the right thing here.
You can help me stop this.

239
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,298
<i>All you have to do is open the door.</i>

240
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,059
<i>Please, I'm begging you.</i>

241
00:13:56,184 --> 00:13:58,670
You're not going to get me
to change my mind.

242
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:02,606
<i>I came here prepared to die.</i>

243
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:06,324
<i>And that's what's going to happen.</i>

244
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:15,395
Just talk to me.

245
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,401
Yes, of course.
I understand.

246
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:52,505
We'll see you soon.

247
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,517
Thank you.

248
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:59,542
Your friend at the State Department...
You trust he can do what he says,

249
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,917
give us asylum?

250
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,996
He says with what your father
has been doing...

251
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,905
Ordering unlawful arrest
and torture...

252
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,830
US law will consider us
political refugees.

253
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,183
But you have to understand,

254
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,481
asylum will not be granted
overnight.

255
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,001
How long are we talking about?

256
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,534
A year, maybe 18 months.

257
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,376
But as soon as we file
the application,

258
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:28,348
we are protected by the law.
Your father cannot touch us.

259
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,561
You know that I will not be able
to work here legally

260
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:34,850
until asylum has been granted.

261
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,486
I have some savings.

262
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:43,441
But I will not be able to give you
the life that you have been used to.

263
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:46,503
You know I don't care
about any of that.

264
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:57,414
One minute.

265
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:01,949
My mother again.

266
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:05,079
I really should answer it.

267
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:07,591
She deserves to know I'm all right.

268
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,844
Give that back to me!

269
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,264
- Please.
- You know what? You can call her

270
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:16,344
when the lawyer
has filed the application.

271
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:18,957
We must wait until then.

272
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,541
Bye-bye.

273
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,598
Kayla, it's me again.

274
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,549
I need to talk to you.

275
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:30,278
Your father told me something terrible
may be happening here in New York.

276
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:31,781
Call me back as soon as

277
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,299
you get this message.

278
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,001
I still can't reach her.

279
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,171
- Thank you for coming back.
- Our daughter is missing.

280
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,257
- I'm not leaving until she's all right.
- We'll find her, Dalia.

281
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:54,365
Nabeel told me
you had Tarin arrested.

282
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,558
I didn't know who I could trust.

283
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:02,628
So you started arresting people
from inside your own delegation?

284
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:06,900
What possible evidence
could you have gathered so quickly?

285
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,015
- I had to do something.
- But Tarin?

286
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,630
He's one of your most loyal men.

287
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,652
So was my brother.

288
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,628
Or so I thought.

289
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,122
Until he tried to have me killed
and destroy my government.

290
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,648
If you keep acting like that,
you will have done the job for him.

291
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:30,382
Have you told the police?

292
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,838
I've been trying to deal
with it on my own.

293
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,389
But it's time to get them involved.

294
00:17:58,179 --> 00:17:59,119
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,410
As you should be!

296
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,078
This city is under attack!

297
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:04,290
Our daughter is god knows where!

298
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,731
You drove her away
with your suspicion

299
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:10,777
and your paranoia!

300
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,514
How could you, Omar?

301
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,489
How could you have lost your way?

302
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:27,823
You're right.

303
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:29,757
I have.

304
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:31,784
I have.

305
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:33,714
I see that now.

306
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,454
And I'll make changes.

307
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:40,030
I'll do everything in my power

308
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:41,608
to find her.

309
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,503
And get her safe.

310
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:47,881
You have my word.

311
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,470
I am sorry.

312
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:55,328


313
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,363
Who is it?

314
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,065
Elaine Al-Zacar?

315
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:21,868
- What do you want?
- My name is Cole Ortiz.

316
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,830
I'm an agent with CTU.
I need you to open that door, ma'am.

317
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:28,413
- I don't understand. What's this about?
- Your son, Marcos.

318
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,171
You're either going to open that door
or I'm gonna break it down. Now!

319
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:35,715
Go!

320
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,430
Are you aware
of where your son is right now?

321
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:43,999
Not at the moment.

322
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:47,012
How much do you know about
his activities on behalf of the IRK?

323
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:50,939
I know

324
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,049
that he communicates with family there,
if that's what you mean.

325
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:57,862
You going somewhere?

326
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,866
I was just about to leave
to my sister's house.

327
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,118
You do that a lot,
visit relatives at 2:30 in the morning?

328
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,192
No, I don't.
I can explain.

329
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,338
Marcos called me about an hour ago.

330
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:12,920
He told me to leave the city.
He said he needed me to meet him

331
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,213
at my sister's house
in Pennsylvania.

332
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,753
- He didn't tell you anything else?
- No.

333
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:19,811
I swear.

334
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:23,513
Your son's barricaded himself
at St. Julian's Hospital,

335
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:26,322
trying to blow himself up
with a suicide vest.

336
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:27,497
Oh, my God.

337
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,520
I need you to come with me...

338
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,189
We don't know how much longer
we have till your son can activate

339
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,858
the explosive.
We have to go.

340
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:54,323
Cole just checked in.
He's got Al-Zacar's mother

341
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:56,612
- he's en route to St. Julian's.
- What's his ETA?

342
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:58,423
Less than ten minutes.

343
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,267
All right, then. Thank you.

344
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:04,259
I would like to apologize again
for leaving my post.

345
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:05,763
I know that I let you down.

346
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,875
Yes, you did.

347
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:11,733
I brought you in
and gave you this promotion

348
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:14,772
because I saw something in you,
not just your skill,

349
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,293
which is considerable.

350
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:21,008
But an ability
to adapt to any situation,

351
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,100
drive to be better,

352
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:26,075
attributes that make you a good leader.
Or did I misread that?

353
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,952


354
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,647
We can chalk up the last several hours
to a serious lapse in judgment?

355
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:33,833
- What I...
- Look.

356
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:36,298
I don't want to lose you or Cole.

357
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,830
You're both valuable,
but everyone is replaceable.

358
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,648
I screwed up and I'm willing

359
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,287
to accept the consequences.

360
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:46,251
I know that Cole feels the same way.

361
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:52,185
Thank you, sir.

362
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:57,606
Hello?

363
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:00,152
<i>- Can I ask who I'm speaking with?</i>
- Excuse me?

364
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,450
<i>Would you mind telling me
your name, please?</i>

365
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:04,405
This is Dana Walsh.
Who is this?

366
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,508
Forgive me, Miss Walsh,
for calling at this ungodly hour.

367
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:11,996
I actually expected to leave a message.
I'm sorry if I woke you.

368
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,457
No, that's okay.
I'm actually at work.

369
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:17,267
- What is this regarding?
- My name's Prady.

370
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:20,129
I'm with the Department of Corrections
down in Little Rock.

371
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:23,328
I'm trying to locate an individual
by the name of...

372
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,851
Kevin Wade.

373
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,177
I'm sorry.
Who did you say that you were again?

374
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:32,608
<i>Bill Prady.
I'm a probation officer.</i>

375
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:35,372
<i>Mr. Wade is one of my charges.
Do you know him?</i>

376
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,013
No. I don't think that I do.

377
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,946
That's peculiar
since he dialed this number

378
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:43,652
a few days ago
from a motel room in Queens.

379
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,339
Probably just a misdial.

380
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:47,548
Dialed this number more than once,

381
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:50,378
and some of the calls
lasted more than a couple of minutes.

382
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:53,028
Mr. Prady, I am really busy right now.
I work for CTU

383
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:55,164
and we are
in the middle of a crisis.

384
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,433
I completely understand.
I've heard the news.

385
00:22:57,672 --> 00:22:59,238
But since we're both awake,

386
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:02,113
I wonder
if I could meet with you in person.

387
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:03,673
You mean now?

388
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:08,845
I got an early flight to Little Rock,
so it'd pretty much have to be now.

389
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:11,789
I'm sorry.
I don't really understand

390
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:13,337
why this is so pressing.

391
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:15,355
<i>Miss Walsh, I've grown kind of fond</i>

392
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,781
of young Kevin, and the longer
it takes me to find him,

393
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,390
the harder it'll be for me

394
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:23,276
to keep him
from going back to prison.

395
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,553
I don't really see
how I can be of any help.

396
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:26,978
<i>Yeah, maybe not.</i>

397
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,999
But we can determine that
when we speak.

398
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,409
Like I said, it won't take long.

399
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:35,759
Look, if it'll smooth things over,

400
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:37,582
I could call your supervisor.

401
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:40,075
No. That won't be necessary.

402
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,462
I'm sure that I could spare
a few minutes for you.

403
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,428
Thank you.
That would be super.

404
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,477
Tell you what.
Let me just pull over,

405
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,342
and I'll get your address.
All right?

406
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:51,535
Of course.

407
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:14,054
According to the bomb techs,
he's close.

408
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:16,470
Getting that third circuit active
was the toughest part.

409
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:18,785
The 4th is only a matter
of rerouting the firing circuits.

410
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,083
- What's the time frame?
- 10 minutes, maybe less.

411
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,002
How much longer to drill through?

412
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,620
They're not going to make it.

413
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:26,397
Get her some water.

414
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:30,323
Take care of that.

415
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,746
Did she resist?

416
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:37,071
Not once I told her he had explosives
and was going to blow himself up.

417
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:39,310
She had a packed suitcase, Jack.

418
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,707
So he cares enough about her
to make sure she got out of town.

419
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:47,272
- What else does she know?
- Nothing, as far as I can tell.

420
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:49,729
- I didn't tell her anything more.
- Okay, good.

421
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:57,495
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm in charge of field operations here.

422
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,298
- Where is he? I want to see him.
- I'm going to take you to him.

423
00:25:00,423 --> 00:25:03,117
Please sit down. I need you
to fully understand the situation.

424
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:04,242
Please.

425
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:11,551
This is Ortiz.

426
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,304
It's me.

427
00:25:13,504 --> 00:25:15,797
Kevin's probation officer
just called me.

428
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:18,285
He's in New York,
trying to track down Kevin.

429
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,141
I can't talk to you now.
We're in the middle here.

430
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:22,416
Listen to me.

431
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:24,804
I told him I didn't know
who Kevin was, but...

432
00:25:25,662 --> 00:25:27,362
He caught me in the lie.

433
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:31,042
He has records that show him
calling my cell several times.

434
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:37,073
This probation officer
is on his way here.

435
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,048
You're going to have to figure out
why he had your number.

436
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,500
I don't know if I can do this.

437
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,916
What, lie?
We both know you're good at it.

438
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:47,942
Sorry.

439
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:50,194
You just have to handle this. Okay?

440
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:51,995
All right?

441
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:55,224
Let me know what happens.

442
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,938
- I can't believe this is happening.
- You need to believe it.

443
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,478
The men your son is working with

444
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,729
intend on detonating a radiological bomb
somewhere in Manhattan.

445
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:10,397
That's why your son
tried to get you out of the city.

446
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,113
He has been an agent for the IRK,
since your husband died.

447
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,239
We have proof of that.

448
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,780
He's going to kill himself
to protect this plot

449
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,756
unless you can convince him.

450
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,539
What do I say to him?

451
00:26:23,864 --> 00:26:25,898
Whatever you have to,
to get him to stop

452
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,977
rearming that vest
and open the door.

453
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:30,650
We need him to open the door.
Do you understand?

454
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:35,121
If he does that,

455
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,270
then what happens to him?

456
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,828
He'll be alive.

457
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:41,999
If he cooperates with us,

458
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:44,160
I will do everything I can
to help him.

459
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:45,633
I give you my word.

460
00:26:48,828 --> 00:26:51,107
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but we need to do this now.

461
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,542
We need the room.

462
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,330
Now.

463
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,158
It's definitely her.

464
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:23,766
Marcos' mother.

465
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,485
You recruited him.
You know him better than anyone.

466
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,688
Will she be able to talk him down?

467
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,610
He's loyal to our country.

468
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,400
I don't think so.

469
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:46,585
<i>It's me.</i>

470
00:27:50,143 --> 00:27:51,419
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

471
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:54,428
<i>You have to stop this.
This is crazy.</i>

472
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,606
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

473
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:59,046
<i>Leave us alone!</i>

474
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:01,495
<i>You leave us alone!</i>

475
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:09,147
Marcos, talk to me.

476
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:12,148
I told you to get out of the city.

477
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,930
I told you to go to aunt Shelley's.
Why didn't you listen to me?

478
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:16,365
I'm listening now.

479
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:19,416
You told me that you meet me there.
I believed you.

480
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,949
- I was trying to protect you.
- From a terrorist attack?

481
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:26,296
That's what they say
that you're involved in here.

482
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,665
Something
that's going to kill many people.

483
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,827
Marcos, tell me that's not true!

484
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:34,781
Tell me!

485
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:40,337
- Marcos, why?
- You ask me that?

486
00:28:41,873 --> 00:28:44,029
After what this country did to dad?

487
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:50,741
I loved your father.
You know I did.

488
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:53,522
But he was

489
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,893
a complicated man,
especially when it came to his politics.

490
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:02,092
But he never condoned violence
of any kind. Never.

491
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:05,165
<i>He would agree
with what we're doing.</i>

492
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,549
<i>You really think that?</i>

493
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:09,590
He hated America.

494
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,302
And yet he came to America.
He married an American.

495
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,631
He had an American son.

496
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,631
<i>Honey, nothing is as simple</i>

497
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,498
<i>as you're making it out to be.</i>

498
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,928
I've registered a 12% degradation
in the hospital's security feed.

499
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:28,933
- Can you boost the signal?
- You're missing the point.

500
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,445
The indications are someone's tapped
into the feed.

501
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,481
They can see everything we can.
I'll see if we can trace it.

502
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:39,825
<i>I wish I'd done more.
I wish I'd...</i>

503
00:29:41,188 --> 00:29:42,071
<i>helped you,</i>

504
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:45,522
<i>deal with your grief
and with your anger.</i>

505
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,827
Don't put this on yourself.

506
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,719
You couldn't have done any more

507
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,782
or been a better mother.

508
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,129
She's almost got him.

509
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,328
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

510
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:01,674
Yeah. Go ahead.

511
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,678
The video feed has been compromised.
You're being surveilled.

512
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,262
<i>I couldn't trace the source.</i>

513
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:08,565
Copy that.
I'll take care of it from here.

514
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,620
How long
to disconnect the video system?

515
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:12,394
- 30 seconds.
- Get on it.

516
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,824
- What's going on?
- Someone else is watching.

517
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:16,495
<i>Mom...</i>

518
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:20,200
<i>I know what they want you to do.</i>

519
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:24,700
- <i>But it's too late for that.</i>
- Don't say that.

520
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,349
You can still turn yourself in.
We'll hire the best lawyers.

521
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,005
Whatever it takes, I'll be with you.
I promise that.

522
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,490
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,757
Marcos, I'm begging you.

524
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,326
Mom, listen to me.

525
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:45,886
You got to be strong now.

526
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:47,505
Damn it. No.

527
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,869
Please. You're all I have.

528
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:53,104
Please don't do this.

529
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,305
<i>I love you so much.</i>

530
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:59,109
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- It's over. Get her out of there.

531
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,508
Samir, I just lost picture.

532
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:26,967
Is his mother still there?

533
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:31,639
No, but he's still in there
with one of the agents.

534
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,140
<i>You detonate that vest,</i>

535
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:47,707
<i>your mother dies, too.</i>

536
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:52,522
What did you say?

537
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:54,774
<i>You heard me.</i>

538
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:58,758
I'll make sure that she's in Manhattan
when that dirty bomb goes off.

539
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,921
You don't even know
what the target is.

540
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,632
I'm not talking about her dying
during the explosion.

541
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:07,866
I'll escort her to the blast site,
so she's exposed to the radiation.

542
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,135
I don't believe you.

543
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:12,836
You wouldn't do that.
You're a federal agent.

544
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:14,999
Truth is, I'm not, really.

545
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:16,224
Not anymore.

546
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,326
I'm more of a specialist
that they brought in for today.

547
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,482
If you knew who I was

548
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,530
and things I've done before
in my life,

549
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:26,652
you would know
that I'm not bluffing.

550
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,304
<i>So, go ahead.</i>

551
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:30,432
<i>Blow yourself up
into a million pieces.</i>

552
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,659
<i>I'm going to make your mother
come in here and clean it up.</i>

553
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,799
And I'm going to take her
to the blast site.

554
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,210
<i>Do you know
how long it takes to absorb</i>

555
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,279
<i>a lethal dose of cesium 137?</i>

556
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:43,836
<i>Five seconds.</i>

557
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,053
Followed by 12 days of pain
that's so agonizing,

558
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:48,935
morphine can't even touch it.

559
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:54,403
You got a decision to make.

560
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:57,576
Make it carefully.

561
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,636
You're not gonna hurt my mother.

562
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:06,311
<i>I am done playing with you.</i>

563
00:33:06,874 --> 00:33:08,424
<i>You look into my eyes.</i>

564
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,152
<i>Look in my eyes!</i>

565
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:21,691
<i>You think I'm joking.</i>

566
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:26,468
<i>What happens to your mother
is because of you.</i>

567
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,810
<i>Only you.</i>

568
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,468
<i>If I open the door and I come out,</i>

569
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:45,326
<i>you promise you won't hurt her?</i>

570
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:49,538
<i>You promise you'll leave her alone?</i>

571
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:53,093
<i>I give you my word.</i>

572
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,031
Cole,
I've got some action on the door.

573
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:26,980
Put your hands up!

574
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:29,299
Walk towards me!
Move!

575
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:30,941
Down on your knees!

576
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:33,589
Put your hands behind your head
and interlock your fingers!

577
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:36,179
Don't you move!

578
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:39,446
Cole, I got four lights on.

579
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:41,745
Damn it!
Cole, I got four lights on!

580
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,879
We need techs.

581
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:45,441
The suspect's come out,
but he's managed to arm the vest.

582
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:49,128
I repeat: he has armed the vest.
We need bomb techs here to disable it!

583
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,215
Marcos is out of the chamber.

584
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,050
- What?
<i>- They must have talked him,</i>

585
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,637
<i>- but he's rearmed the vest.</i>
- You're sure? He's still wearing it?

586
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,763
I think so.

587
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,817
Hang up and transmit the fail-safe.

588
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:02,808
Let's move!

589
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,145
Keep you men back!
I know the circuit pattern!

590
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,978
I'm looking for four common leads
before I can disarm it.

591
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,699
What's happening?!
What is that?!

592
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,365
They must have triggered a fail-safe.
Get you men back now.

593
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,246
Move!

594
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,365
- Get this off of me!
- I'm gonna try! Just stay calm!

595
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:28,807
Mom!

596
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:31,124
Get her out of here now!

597
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,218
I might not be able to do this in time.
I need to know what the target is.

598
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,928
- I dunno.
- How are they smuggling

599
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,067
the rods into the city
past the detectors?

600
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:44,125
- I don't know, I swear!
- Who does?!

601
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,271
Give me a name.

602
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,938
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name!

603
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,066
President Hassan's head of security
Tarin Faroush!

604
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:55,194
Tarin Faroush.
Did you get that?

605
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,458
Copy!

606
00:35:58,213 --> 00:35:59,213
Come on.

607
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:00,528
One more.

608
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:06,288
I'm not gonna be able
to do this in time.

609
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,406
You tell my mother I'm sorry.

610
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,500
Jack, do you copy?

611
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:28,716
CTU, this is Jack.

612
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:30,817
Marcos is dead.

613
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:33,928
I'm gonna need to speak
to President Hassan.

614
00:36:42,412 --> 00:36:45,254
Commissioner, I appreciate
that your NYPD's overburdened,

615
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,830
but I would ask you
to do whatever you can...

616
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,541
to have
my daughter's picture circulated.

617
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,062
Please keep me posted if you get
informations regarding her whereabouts.

618
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,465
Thank you.

619
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:05,674
Sir, CTU is routing a call to you.

620
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,267
- From whom?
- Jack Bauer.

621
00:37:15,642 --> 00:37:16,984
This is President Hassan.

622
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:21,056
I was told you were briefed
on the situation at the hospital.

623
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:21,979
<i>I was.</i>

624
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:26,159
The suicide bomber is dead.
His vest was remotely detonated.

625
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,916
- Then you have no leads.
- No, sir, we actually do.

626
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,547
Before the suspect was killed,

627
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:33,792
he identified your head of security,
Tarin Faroush, as a co-conspirator.

628
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,004
Tarin?

629
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:39,423
Are you sure?

630
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,751
Right now
you need to call UN security

631
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:44,052
and have them
take Mr. Faroush into custody.

632
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,640
That won't be possible, Mr. Bauer.

633
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:50,767
Tarin's not here.

634
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,004
Where is he?

635
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:54,066
I don't know.
Somewhere with my daughter.

636
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:55,105
Excuse me?

637
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,940
They are in love...

638
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:58,365
So I've learned.

639
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,782
Mr. Bauer, I suspected Tarin hours ago,
and had him arrested for questioning.

640
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,565
He escaped
while being transported to our embassy.

641
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:11,756
Kayla believed he was innocent,
and has, apparently,

642
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:13,624
run away with him.

643
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,675
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

644
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:17,461
Can you contact her?

645
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,547
My wife has made several attempts,
but she isn't answering her phone.

646
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,467
Sir, you need to keep trying.
Mr. Faroush is our only lead.

647
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,345
I'm going to jump in the shower.

648
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:45,155
<i>Hello, Mother.</i>

649
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:47,481
I have her.

650
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,371
We have Kayla on line
with her mother.

651
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,192
You need to get me an address.

652
00:38:54,317 --> 00:38:57,879
I'm sorry I've been ignoring your calls,
but I know Father has put you up.

653
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,086
Where are you?

654
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,692
I can't tell you that.

655
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:02,172
Is Tarin with you?

656
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,940
Not at the moment, no.

657
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,301
He doesn't want me
to speak to anyone.

658
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,417
Kayla, listen to me,

659
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:10,634
you are in danger.

660
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:13,934
Tarin is working
with your father's enemies.

661
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,812
That's not true.
It's Father's paranoid delusions.

662
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,967
It isn't.
CTU just called to confirm.

663
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:20,899
They're on the line
with your father.

664
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:22,650
I don't believe you.

665
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,144
Kayla, please.

666
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:30,044
You know
I loathed your father's behavior

667
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:33,445
and the way
that he's handled everything.

668
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,874
I wouldn't be telling you this
unless I believed it, too.

669
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:39,287
Not Tarin.

670
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,971
It has to be a mistake.

671
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,439
Then we'll sort it out together.

672
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:48,497
But you must tell me where you are.

673
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:55,851
The Teodore hotel, suite 514.

674
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,832
The Teodore, suite 514.

675
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:01,241
Kayla, darling,
just stay where you are.

676
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,193
They are at the Teodore hotel,
suite 514.

677
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,750
Thank you, sir.

678
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:11,721
I promise I'll call you
once the Americans give us the signal.

679
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:13,660
Please don't tell Father we spoke.

680
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,579
- I love you, too.
- Hello?

681
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:19,374
We agreed you weren't gonna take
your mother's call.

682
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,210
I'm sorry, my love.
I just didn't want her to worry.

683
00:40:24,013 --> 00:40:25,670
Did you tell her where we are?

684
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:28,133
Did you?

685
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,388
Of course not.

686
00:40:29,826 --> 00:40:31,595
Do you think I'm stupid?

687
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:34,309
You know
I could never think such a thing.

688
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,682
You are perfection.

689
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:41,104
- Come on. We must get dressed.
- Where are we going?

690
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:43,662
Where do you think?

691
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:45,442
To formally request our asylum.

692
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:46,984
At this hour?

693
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,154
My friend made the arrangements.

694
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,177
But I'm exhausted.

695
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,040
We haven't even slept.

696
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,110
I suppose you blame me for that.

697
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:57,115
Well, then...

698
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:00,329
Can't we have
a little more time together?

699
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,879
Come on.

700
00:41:05,013 --> 00:41:06,421
You must get dressed.

701
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,927
Why don't you just get dressed here?

702
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:14,936
I'm just gonna clean up first.

703
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:46,169
Our men are clearing out now.
It's all yours.

704
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,810
- Where are we?
- I could have a tac team in 20 minutes.

705
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:50,499
No, NYPD can get there faster.

706
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:53,310
I want your men to set up a perimeter
and wait until we get there.

707
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:55,817
If any of your men
comes in contact with the suspect,

708
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:58,348
they must know we need
to take him alive. Let's go.
