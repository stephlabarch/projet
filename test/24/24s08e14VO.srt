3
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:16,796
There's an IRK cell trying to smuggle
weapons-grade uranium.

4
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,245
Just read the assessment.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,476
I need you to shut down
all bridge and tunnel traffic.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,999
- Where'd he go?
- There's only one way to get in.

7
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:27,314
- Across the East River.
- That's right.

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,695
CTU was just hit by an EMP.

9
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:32,823
<i>- All of our systems are down.
- Where's Jack?</i>

10
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,507
He might be in some kind of trouble.
We need to find him.

11
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:37,620
Get the CTU back on line.

12
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,539
Once you acquire Jack's position,
you can direct me to him.

13
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,583
I have a faster way to get us back.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,086
- They won't listen.
- You need to make them.

15
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,629
Do what you have to do.

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,423
Senior Engineer
at the New York field.

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,592
I hope that you're here to help.

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,096
- You going in through the CLR?
- We're gonna create a brand-new subnet.

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,814
That'll take forever.

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,265
I can create a workaround.

21
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,017
Why not tap into the trunk line?

22
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:01,977
It will be a lot faster.

23
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,105
I'm here to clean up your mess.
Leave.

24
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,398
You get out.

25
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,816
Get out!

26
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,321
We got power to comm.

27
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:13,948
Load the rods.

28
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,736
It'll be short work
once we get the rods across the river.

29
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,474
<i>A vehicle is coming.</i>

30
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:21,247
Wait until the SUVs in range,

31
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:22,915
then take them out.

32
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,917
Get down! Now!

33
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,985
I've got two men
leaving the doc in a boat.

34
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,759
They're carrying a box
and shape for the rods.

35
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,855
I got through to CTU.
They just got back on line.

36
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,357
NYPD's sending choppers.
We still finding them.

37
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,486
I know you're involved
with that robbery.

38
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:54,085
What?

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,990
You are out of your mind.

40
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,371
I'm not leaving here
until I know the truth.

41
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,959
CTU is back on line.

42
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:08,364
I know.

43
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:10,546
Their helicopter's
searching the river.

44
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,839
They're close.

45
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,804
We need your help getting clear.

46
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,301
I will get you out.

47
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,345
Stand by.
I'll call you in a few minutes.

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,024
You have grade 3 level bruising.

49
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:35,538
- You sure about painkillers?
- They're wrapped tight.

50
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:36,906
I can't know if the ribs

51
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,620
are broken without an X-ray.

52
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:41,166
Any more stress
could cause the lung to collapse.

53
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,134
They're not broken. Thanks.

54
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:46,985
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Fine.

55
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:48,997
Where are we at with the rods?

56
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:52,387
We found the Zodiac partly submerged
in the river near 11th Street, empty.

57
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,179
The rods are in Manhattan.

58
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,978
CTU doesn't think we're more
than a few minutes behind.

59
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,091
Who's running the ground op. Cole?

60
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,682
Contact Chloe. Get her to download
archival photos from 11th and the river.

61
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,905
Have her date 'em back 15 minutes.
Fire it up. I want you ready to go

62
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,896
as soon as we've got a target.

63
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,738
Just spoke to a witness who said
he saw four men unloading the contents

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,847
of a metal crate into a yellow cab.

65
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:22,602
- He didn't get a plate.
- Can we roll back satellite?

66
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:24,203
Yes. NSA just rerouted them.

67
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,571
I'm logging onto their server now.

68
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,473
This is from one minute ago.

69
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm rolling back
in 30 second increments.

70
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:39,577
- This is from six minutes ago.
- Find them in real time.

71
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:41,679
Alert NYPD. Dana?

72
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,895
- Right here.
- Contact Hazmat NEST teams

73
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,808
- get them mobilized.
- Right on that.

74
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:47,935
Almost there.

75
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,063
Suspects are proceeding west

76
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,465
- on 14th Street.
- Did you get that?

77
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,462
Yes, sir.
On the move.

78
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,442
They've located you on satellite.

79
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,313
- How far away are they?
- Not very.

80
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:05,863
- Hold on.
- NYPD units are on the way.

81
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,596
- How far out?
- Ten blocks

82
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,582
- coming from the north.
- Head to the south.

83
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,750
Turn left.

84
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,950
- Suspect turned south on Seventh.
- Got it.

85
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,464
- I hear sirens. Hurry up.
- Just a second.

86
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:30,045
I'm inserting the machine code now.

87
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,555
Just get ready.

88
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,315
Satellite will be disabled for 30

89
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,483
seconds.

90
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:37,221
On my mark.

91
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:44,877
Go.

92
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,328
- What happened?
- The trunk line went out.

93
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,496
Get it back!

94
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,331
lost picture.
Last location, Seventh and Waverly.

95
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,374
Copy that.

96
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,343
Where are you?

97
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:06,191
- On the Hudson, heading uptown again.
- You'll run into Ninth Avenue.

98
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:08,755
You'll be able
to blend into cab traffic there.

99
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,861
Back up.

100
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,655
- Cab's gone.
- Find it!

101
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,615
Scanning.

102
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,603
Help me widen the grid.
You take West of Seventh, me East.

103
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,619
Widening it.

104
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,274
Anything?

105
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,872
We were out for 30 seconds.
They could be anywhere.

106
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,220
- We're back up, but we lost them.
- I'll have NYPD cordon off the area.

107
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,756
You have them check every garage,
warehouse, loading dock.

108
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,621
<i>They must have pulled in somewhere.</i>

109
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,095
Get me the president.

110
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:48,034
Are we clear?

111
00:05:48,737 --> 00:05:49,737
Good.

112
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:52,745
We're moving the weapon
into place as soon as it is assembled.

113
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,906
I need you to send me
NYPD patrol patterns and checkpoints.

114
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:59,108
- As soon as it's safe.
- That's not good enough.

115
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:03,406
My instructions were to help you,
not jeopardize my cover.

116
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,463
I will call you back when I can.

117
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:10,862
I'm afraid I have bad news.

118
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,218
<i>Despite our best efforts,</i>

119
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:16,083
<i>the terrorists have gotten
the nuclear rods into Manhattan.</i>

120
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,206
How good is your intelligence?
Are you sure?

121
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:23,093
We are. In fact we had a visual
on the suspects until a few moments ago.

122
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,258
What happened?

123
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,523
We lost them.

124
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:29,972
We're launching a multi-agency search
in the area we think they're in.

125
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:31,932
That you think they're in?

126
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,427
Will you be able
to find them, or not?

127
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,273
We're doing everything in our power,

128
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,523
but right know
I don't have an answer for you.

129
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,891
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

130
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,619
I can no longer guarantee
the safety of Manhattan.

131
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,416
How could this happen?
CTU had one priority.

132
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,040
To make sure this didn't happen!
It's unacceptable!

133
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,760
I want you to consider
the entire resource

134
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,834
of the government at your disposal.
We must find those rods.

135
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,406
I understand.

136
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,685
We need to prepare for the worst.

137
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,065
I want all branches
of local law enforcement

138
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,007
ready to respond
to an imminent radiologic attack.

139
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:16,769
Set up a situation room

140
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:18,979
and assemble
the National Security team.

141
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:24,777
Has Hassan

142
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,612
been evacuated from the UN yet?

143
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,205
He will be shortly,
he's still at the UN.

144
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,900
Get me Jack Bauer.

145
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,459
How long was the satellite down?
30 seconds?

146
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:43,168
I know what you're thinking.
Odd we lost the feed

147
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,996
just as we were closing in
on the target.

148
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,049
Who was running point at CTU?

149
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,133
Chloe O'Brian.
You know her from before?

150
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:50,594
- <i>Yes.</i>
- And you trust her?

151
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:51,975
With my life.

152
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,098
I have President Taylor.

153
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:57,036
I call you back.
I got the White House on the line.

154
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:00,979
Jack, it's President Taylor.

155
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,432
- I'm calling to ask you a favor.
- <i>Anything</i>.

156
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,723
Hassan and his family
are being evacuated

157
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:07,293
from the UN and brought here.

158
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:09,988
I would like for you
to supervise that operation.

159
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,562
With all due respect,
I think I'd be much more helpful

160
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,328
staying in place here with CTU.

161
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,495
Secret Service is more than capable.

162
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,996
Maybe, but I'd feel a lot better
knowing you were on the job.

163
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:24,459
In light of the threat to New York,
President Hassan's role

164
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,033
in securing a lasting peace
is more crucial than ever.

165
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,458
I need him safe.

166
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:31,135
I understand.
I'll leave for the UN now.

167
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,263
Thank you.
I'll see you when you get here.

168
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:39,017
She wants me to supervise Hassan's evac
to McGuire Air Force Base.

169
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:40,408
Let's go.

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,340
I need to do this on my own.

171
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,264
I'm coming with you,
end of discussion.

172
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:32,779
- Do you have the rods?
- In the trunk.

173
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,239
Where is Ali?

174
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:36,533
He didn't make it.

175
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,827
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,234
Tarin will take his place as driver.

177
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,734
How long
before the device is functional?

178
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,792
All we have to do
is load in the rods.

179
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,675
Get ready to leave.

180
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,054
I want to place the bomb as soon after
I talk to the president.

181
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,170
Agent O'Connor.

182
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,992
I know. I've been briefed
by command at McGuire.

183
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,462
We're cleared
for a subterranean evacuation.

184
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:40,012
Hassan will be safer underground

185
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,771
- in he event of a the attack.
- How many agents?

186
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:44,773
Seven Secret Service,
including myself,

187
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:47,086
two of Hassan's internal security,
and you two.

188
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,772
- Time frame?
- Ten minutes.

189
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,607
There's a service tunnel

190
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,192
leading into New Jersey.

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,404
- We're just waiting on the vehicles.
- I'd like to see the exact route.

192
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,935
The protocols are
in the conference room,

193
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,285
but Hassan is asking to see you first.
He's in the council chamber.

194
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,052
Fine.

195
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,025
You two get started.
I'll be right back.

196
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:21,865
President Taylor wanted me to supervise
the evac of you and your family

197
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,307
- to McGuire Air Force Base.
- So I'm told.

198
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:25,642
And I'm glad for it.

199
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,813
How long will it take to be ready?

200
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:28,979
We're ready now.

201
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,159
My family are in the residence
awaiting your instructions.

202
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,400
In ten minutes

203
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,220
we'll evacuate you
through the service tunnel,

204
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,738
straight on to New Jersey.

205
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,549
And here I thought I would be leaving
the United Nations today

206
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:45,076
at the head of a peace march
down Fifth Avenue.

207
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,983
My president still thinks
that might happen.

208
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:51,564
I hope she's right.

209
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:53,764
Me too.

210
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:55,756
Ten minutes.

211
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,834
We need to talk about a response.

212
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,270
I've prepared
three retaliatory strike scenarios

213
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:13,857
- against targets inside the IRK.
- Do I need to remind you,

214
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,692
the Islamic Republic

215
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,235
is an ally?

216
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,148
No.

217
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,739
But what good is an ally
if its citizens can attack us

218
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,238
on their own?

219
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:25,619
A man called the White House

220
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,662
and he says he has the rods

221
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:29,949
He wants to talk to you.

222
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:32,167
Do we believe
he's who he says he is?

223
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,836
Confidence is high.
He's offered details of recent events

224
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,671
that no civilian could know.

225
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,826
Plus he's on an anonymous ICC channel
that's scrambled.

226
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:41,843
Put him on speaker.

227
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:49,893
This is President Taylor.

228
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,791
Good morning, Madam President.

229
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,855
This is going to be
a short conversation.

230
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,173
Who are you and what do you want?

231
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,026
You know I have the rods.

232
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,501
You know I got them into Manhattan.

233
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,697
What I want now is to convince you

234
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:06,232
that I have no desire
to harm innocent Americans.

235
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:09,213
And yet you're threatening them
with a bomb.

236
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:12,144
Actually,
a radiological dispersal device,

237
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,075
capable of contaminating 40² blocks
under a dense radiation cloud.

238
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,269
Any attack on the United States

239
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,588
will prompt a retaliation
against your country.

240
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,613
I would expect nothing less.

241
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,304
But you should listen to me.

242
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,914
What I'm asking for is simple.

243
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,684
Turn over President Hassan.

244
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:33,614
What?

245
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,647
<i>He's a traitor and must stand trial.</i>

246
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,651
That will never happen.

247
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,569
You have exactly one hour

248
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,802
to change your mind.

249
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:45,760
Mr. Woods knows how to contact me.

250
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,577
The clock starts now.

251
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,875
40² blocks...
how many people is that?

252
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,874
Between a 100,000 and 150,000.

253
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,966
Inform CTU of the threat,
but the ransom demand

254
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,584
stays in this room.

255
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,346
Tim, call up the New York Guard
to support first responders,

256
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,266
and have the military police execute

257
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,779
an evacuation plan.

258
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:15,562
What is it?

259
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,108
I'm just going to say it.
We should consider the alternative.

260
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:21,943
Which is?

261
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:23,695
We have an out here.

262
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,957
We should take it.

263
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,853
Give in to the demand
to turn over President Hassan?

264
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:30,615
No one man is worth
the lives of tens of thousands.

265
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,185
I bet he would agree.

266
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,690
Are we really
having this conversation?

267
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:36,416
Doesn't it deserve a conversation?

268
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,760
Not unless you're intent
on destroying our moral authority.

269
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,797
This country's unique place
among nations, maybe forever.

270
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,415
As opposed to what?

271
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,927
The irradiation of all those people?

272
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,678
Real businesses and homes

273
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,931
uninhabitable
for a hundred years or more?

274
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:01,117
I agree.

275
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,945
Giving up Hassan is wrong,
but a wasteland at the heart of NYC

276
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,363
is unthinkable.

277
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,325
- This country would never be the same.
- They'd crucify us if word ever got out

278
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,119
- that this could have been avoided.
- Now we're talking politics?

279
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,863
We're talking about
the primary role of government...

280
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:17,338
any government...

281
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,434
- which is to protect its citizens.
- It could also escalate.

282
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:23,296
They attack us,

283
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,964
we attack them back.

284
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,647
The entire region could be drawn
into the conflict and destabilized.

285
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:31,179
Weren't you the one just advocating

286
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,061
for a retaliatory strike?

287
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:36,582
In the military, we like
to talk about facts on the ground.

288
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,358
They have changed.

289
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,429
Now, we have a viable option.

290
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:43,503
Viable?

291
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:47,610
Is that the sense in the room then?

292
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,869
That surrendering

293
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,408
President Hassan is somehow viable?

294
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:53,451
First,

295
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,777
the people who are offering us this deal
cannot be trusted.

296
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,790
And if they detonate
the bomb anyway?

297
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,364
Secondly,

298
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,083
Hassan is a guest of this country.

299
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,317
He is my partner in peace.

300
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:08,633
And I will not sell him out
to the very terrorists

301
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,908
that we are determined to defeat.

302
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,137
And finally,

303
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:14,965
caving to any terrorist demand

304
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,801
weakens this nation immeasurably.

305
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,437
Now, we have 60 minutes

306
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,502
to find these bastards.

307
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,190
And I believe we will.

308
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,101
But if we don't,
and the worst happens,

309
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,776
we will deal with it.

310
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,667
We will pick ourselves
up off the floor and deal with it.

311
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,357
Why? Because that's what we do.

312
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,030
Americans don't stay down.

313
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,191
We rise up together
in times of crisis.

314
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,416
We carry on.

315
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,587
Is that clear?

316
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:55,847
Start the calls.

317
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:16,304
I need an updated list
of road closures and checkpoints.

318
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,495
I thought Arlo
was interfacing with NYPD.

319
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,185
He is, but National Guard units
and the FBI are on their way.

320
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,629
I want to know where the holes are,
so I can plug them.

321
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:26,834
I'll forward it to your screen now.

322
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,959
Thank you.

323
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,359
<i>- Yes?</i>
- It's me.

324
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,516
Do you have
the roadblock information?

325
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,228
In five minutes.

326
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,353
- Did you speak to President Taylor?
- <i>I did.</i>

327
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,368
Her response was as I anticipated.

328
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,032
But as the time pressure builds,
she'll change her mind

329
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:54,114
- and give up Hassan. I'm certain of it.
- What if she doesn't?

330
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:56,335
Then we'll strike a hard blow.

331
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:57,676
Either way,

332
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,300
the peace process dies.

333
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:09,279
It's ready.

334
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,232
I don't have time
to deal with these.

335
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,001
Can I have a word?

336
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,126
Certainly.

337
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,144
I thought Secretary Kanin's point

338
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,375
was a good one.

339
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,409
If we simply turn Hassan over,

340
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:30,108
we risk damaging the good name
of the United States.

341
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,235
What are you suggesting?

342
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:34,571
A third way.

343
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:36,506
A covert action...

344
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,074
in which

345
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,917
we deliver Hassan to the terrorists,

346
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,995
but make it look like
they took him hostage.

347
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,622
Two birds, Mr. Weiss.

348
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:47,602
We spare New York

349
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,377
and we preserve our reputation

350
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,971
in the eyes of the world.

351
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,382
I admit, I'm intrigued.

352
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:55,508
But?

353
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:57,422
It'll never fly.

354
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:59,387
You heard the president.
She won't go for it.

355
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,056
- Not in a million years.
- No, of course, she won't.

356
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,224
The question is, will you?

357
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:10,982
I'm asking

358
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,700
for your cooperation.

359
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,445
For the good of the country.

360
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:19,903
Even if I agreed to help,

361
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,996
it's too late.
Hassan's already on his way here.

362
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,038
It's not.
A Wet Ops team was mobilized

363
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,695
in the event of a strike
against the IRK.

364
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,002
If you get me Hassan's exact route,
I can redirect them

365
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,911
to intercept his security detail.

366
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:35,924
I don't have access that information.
It's being handled through

367
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,138
- the Secretary of State's office.
- We just have to get it from Mr. Kanin.

368
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:42,532
It's sedition, General Brucker.

369
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,019
Are you familiar
with the fourth Nuremberg principle?

370
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:51,282
If the orders of the president
are illegal,

371
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,025
it is our moral obligation
to disobey them.

372
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,069
And you think they are?
Illegal?

373
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,405
The president is letting her idealism
get in the way of her responsibilities

374
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,741
- as Commander in Chief.
- It's hardly the same thing.

375
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,284
You don't think so?

376
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,745
With the fate of an American city
in the balance?

377
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,414
"The primary role of government
is to protect

378
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,032
"its citizens."
Your words, Mr. Weiss.

379
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,196
It's time to decide
whether or not you meant them.

380
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,346
I need everyone's attention.

381
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:02,135
The White House just received
credible intelligence

382
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,300
that the terrorists
we've been tracking

383
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,185
plan to detonate a radiological device
in New York City,

384
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:10,182
in less than 50 minutes.

385
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,442
All of us have friends

386
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,516
and family who live in the city.

387
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,078
We know we are bound by law
not to warn them.

388
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,666
But we also know it is still
in our power to protect them.

389
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,400
We a their last line of defense.

390
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:35,084
That is our job.
That is what we will do

391
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,841
with every second
of every minute we have left.

392
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:39,793
Starting now.

393
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,841
Go back through all your leads.

394
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,513
Appeal to your sources
one more time.

395
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,133
Find that bomb.

396
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:09,057
I just heard
from our source inside CTU.

397
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,821
<i>Based on the roadblocks,
Amsterdam is closed off,</i>

398
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:14,666
<i>but there's a potential target area
just to your left.</i>

399
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,627
You'll be avoiding NYPD checkpoints
to the south and west.

400
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:18,988
All right.

401
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:22,025
Turning.

402
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:24,402
Can you park in that block?

403
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:28,762
Good.

404
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:31,957
The fallout radius will include
a good part of the Upper West Side.

405
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,479
I'll wait for your call.

406
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:12,778
How many men on the detail?

407
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,359
Eleven.

408
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:16,698
Hassan's own security,
Secret Service,

409
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:19,722
and two former agents,
Jack Bauer and Renee Walker.

410
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:21,065
Why is Bauer involved?

411
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,687
The president trusts him.

412
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:25,091
Believe me,
he's not someone to be taken lightly.

413
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:28,239
He's up against elite team
who will have the advantage of surprise.

414
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,521
Bauer and his people
don't stand a chance.

415
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,429
The loss of life is regrettable.

416
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,024
No one feels this more keenly

417
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,224
than a soldier
who's led men into battle.

418
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,320
But right now,
we don't have a choice.

419
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:00,927
What's going on?

420
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:03,934
I'm sorry.
I thought you were with the president.

421
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,235
I was.

422
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:08,488
What are you doing in here?

423
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:12,314
I asked Mr. Weiss to pull up the latest
White House readiness protocols.

424
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:15,411
He couldn't log on from his computer,
so we were trying from yours.

425
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,198
I was also reviewing
Hassan's itinerary

426
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:26,988
to see if we could facilitate
a military escort.

427
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:41,739
Open the door.

428
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,284
I'm afraid I can't do that,
Mr. Kanin.

429
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,804
Then get out of my way.

430
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:53,783
- Rob?
- Listen, I...

431
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,501
No, you listen to me.

432
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,040
I think I have a pretty good idea
what's going on here.

433
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,793
Sit down.
There are some things you need to know.

434
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,535
There sure as hell are.

435
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,560
But I'll stay where I am,

436
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:10,883
if you don't mind.

437
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:13,302
Do what he says.
Sit down, please.

438
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,013
<i>This is Bauer. Go ahead.</i>

439
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,178
I said, go ahead.

440
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,814
- Give me your phone.
- Get your hands off of me!

441
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:26,357
Wait!

442
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,108
This is beyond madness.

443
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:36,472
You will spend
the rest of your lives in prison.

444
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:37,326
Maybe.

445
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:42,415
But my guess is that one day,
the country will thank us for it.

446
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:50,409
I'm begging you.

447
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:53,004
Don't do this.

448
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:56,908
Don't betray your president.

449
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:06,432
All right.

450
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:13,265
My God! Ethan!

451
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,000
Here, here, here.

452
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:25,710
Call a medic.

453
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:29,086
We call for help, first thing he does
is get word to the president.

454
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,339
He's having a heart attack!
We must to act!

455
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,090
You gave him his medication.

456
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:34,967
It's not working.

457
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,261
You two are close.

458
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,430
But this is not
an emotional decision,

459
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:41,405
this is a tactical one.

460
00:26:42,563 --> 00:26:44,329
We wait to acquire Hassan

461
00:26:44,454 --> 00:26:46,145
before calling an ambulance,
understand?

462
00:26:46,494 --> 00:26:48,231
What if he doesn't
make it that long?

463
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,025
We have to pray that he does.

464
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:03,882
All right?

465
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,210
All right.

466
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:10,219
Come on.

467
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,312
We pick up the tunnel
under Third Avenue.

468
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:19,129
From there, the trip to McGuire
by convoy is less than 30 minutes.

469
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:20,766
Thank you, Ms. Walker.

470
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,555
Secretary Kanin, this is Jack Bauer.

471
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,112
I can see on my phone
that you just tried to call me.

472
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:33,518
Please call me back as soon as you can.
Thank you.

473
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:34,643
<i>CTU.</i>

474
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,560
This is Bauer. Patch me through
to McGuire Air Force Base.

475
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,202
How far are you from an access point
into the tunnels?

476
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,158
Based on what I'm looking at,

477
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:50,543
less than two miles.

478
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,462
The security detail's on the move.
Can you get there in time?

479
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,812
Yeah, if we haul ass.

480
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:57,300
- And the ambush happens where?
- At the vehicle.

481
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,529
Remember,
the objective is President Hassan.

482
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:01,594
Do what you have to do
to take him alive.

483
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:03,779
Good luck.

484
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,189
Thank you. Have him call me back
as soon as possible.

485
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:14,529
Secretary Kanin tried to call me.
Now he's not answering his phone.

486
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:17,481
The operator at McGuire Air Force Base
can't find him either.

487
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:20,306
Something's not right.
Keep your eyes open.

488
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:37,178
Hold up.

489
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:41,010
- We set?
- Yeah, the vehicles

490
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,189
for the Hassans
are 200 meters up the tunnel.

491
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:45,306
There is a section
we couldn't get by.

492
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:50,102
<i>Agent Dalton, standby.
We are bringing the family down now.</i>

493
00:28:50,752 --> 00:28:52,823
- Did you walk it?
- Yes, sir. All clear.

494
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:54,896
Get the family.

495
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:56,702
This way. Let's go.

496
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,906
Our SUVs are a short hike up the tunnel.
Stay together as we move towards them.

497
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:04,680
-<i> Operations.</i>
- This is Bauer.

498
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:07,105
Patch me through to Secretary Kanin.

499
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:11,783
Here they come.

500
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,209
Is Hassan with them?

501
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:16,757
Masks on.

502
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,382
Take your positions.

503
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,847
Wait until they are in the kill zone.
Remember, we need to take Hassan alive.

504
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,020
Secretary Kanin?

505
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,066
Just a minute.

506
00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:53,749
What is it?

507
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,210
Excuse me, but Jack Bauer's
calling for Mr. Kanin.

508
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:58,963
- He's busy with me right now.
- I understand that,,

509
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,351
but Mr. Bauer's persisting.
He says it's important.

510
00:30:01,476 --> 00:30:02,758
He's holding on line one.

511
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,803
All right, thank you.
I'll take care of it.

512
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:21,905
Hi. It's Rob Weiss.

513
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,986
<i>We're in a tunnel under...</i>

514
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:26,157
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.
Can't hear you.

515
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,261
We're in a service tunnel
under the UN.

516
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:30,335
We're evacuating President Hassan.

517
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,163
- <i>Is everything fine?</i>
- You tell me.

518
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,721
Secretary Kanin tried to get ahold of me
about ten minutes ago on his cell.

519
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:37,585
Ever since, he won't pick up.

520
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,087
The secretary's tied up
with the Joint Chiefs.

521
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:42,631
What did he want
to talk to me about?

522
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:44,800
Couldn't say.
It could've been anything.

523
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,789
I don't think so.
He knows we're making a sensitive evac.

524
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:50,097
He called me during it.
There must be a connection.

525
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,768
I'll make sure he gets the message.

526
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,145
I don't think you understand.
I need to talk to Secretary Kanin now.

527
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:57,813
That's not possible.

528
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,231
What do you mean?

529
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,891
We're dealing with an imminent
terrorist attack on our soil!

530
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:03,546
Do your job and t us do ours!

531
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:05,595
All due respect, I am doing my j...

532
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:10,410
- Son of a bitch just hung up on me.
- He's under a lot of stress.

533
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,671
I don't give a...
Agent O'Connor, stop.

534
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:16,603
Start walking them back now.

535
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:21,378
Something's wrong. We'll head back
to the UN, reassess there. Let's go.

536
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,486
President Hassan, I'm very sorry,
but you're too exposed down here.

537
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:28,928
I trust in you.

538
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,471
They're turning around.

539
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:32,035
How far are they?

540
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,682
About a hundred yards.

541
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,895
Okay, take out as many as you can.

542
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,361
Get down!

543
00:31:55,822 --> 00:31:58,290
I need you to get
President Hassan and his family

544
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,077
to the side tunnel
and back to the UN!

545
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,418
What about you?

546
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:03,393
I'll be right behind you!

547
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:05,923
You need to go. Now. Now!

548
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,166
Go! Go!

549
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,575
Your orders are to stay
with President Hassan. You need to go.

550
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,927
I know what I have to do.

551
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,558
Good Iuck.

552
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:56,339
Thank you, sir.

553
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:59,568
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

554
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,940
Now!

555
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,514
See if you can get wide
and outflank them.

556
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,697
I'm going to try to draw them
into a crossfire.

557
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:23,572
Shoot only on my command.

558
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:27,102
Engage.

559
00:33:59,144 --> 00:34:02,189
- We need to keep moving.
- Your people are being slaughtered.

560
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,832
- We need to help them.
- They're buying us the time we need.

561
00:34:04,957 --> 00:34:06,794
Don't let it be in vain.
We need to go!

562
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:44,838
Give me a weapon.

563
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:48,047
I've been a soldier. I can handle a gun.
I'll fight with you.

564
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,466
My job is to protect you.
You need to do what I say. Now, go!

565
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:59,304
- We have to keep moving. Come on.
- Come on. We got to go.

566
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:07,429
We won't to make it.

567
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:08,604
Take cover.

568
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:10,002
Go! Go!

569
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:24,002
I'm going to head up the middle.
When I set these off, start firing.

570
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:26,893
Doesn't matter if you hit anything.
Just make some noise...

571
00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:28,018
President?

572
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,463
You take care of your family.
You ready?

573
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,342
Let's go.

574
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,079
Mathis! Donner! Go!

575
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,041
Move! Move!

576
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:16,381
Move! Move! Move!

577
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,420
I'll take the high ground.

578
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:47,841
In about 5 seconds,
start giving me cover fire.

579
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,952
Take the weapon off.
Take the weapon off now!

580
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,292
Now!

581
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,140
Who are you?

582
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:43,635
You're making a huge mistake.

583
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,197
You're American.

584
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,065
Why did you attack us?

585
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:51,930
Because a dirty bomb
will be detonated in New York

586
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:54,268
unless we deliver
Hassan to the terrorists.

587
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:55,772
What are you talking about?

588
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:58,025
A ransom demand has been made.

589
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:01,236
Him for the bomb by 06:15 hours.

590
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:06,658
Jack, that's less than 20 minutes.

591
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:10,844
- Does the president know about this?
- She refused the deal.

592
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:12,539
This is General Brucker's operation.

593
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:16,162
- Get up. Get up!
- What are you doing?

594
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,171
Get you up to the street level,
so I can make a call.

595
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,340
There's no time for that.
This is on you now.

596
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:24,051
You have to deliver
Hassan to the terrorists.

597
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,346
I don't take orders from anybody
but the President. Now, move.

598
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,010
Keep moving.

599
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:05,842
Yes?

600
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:10,318
- Why haven't I heard from you?
- <i>Because I don't know anything.</i>

601
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:13,684
I don't understand. Are the Americans
handing over Hassan, or not?

602
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,140
We only know that he's being
transported to McGuire Air Force Base.

603
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:20,816
We lost comm with his security detail
about 20 minutes ago.

604
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:25,435
So President Taylor
doesn't intend to give him up.

605
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:29,491
Think for a minute.

606
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,877
You use that bomb,
you lose your leverage.

607
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:35,265
The president leaves me no choice.

608
00:39:36,848 --> 00:39:38,792
The blood will be on her hands.

609
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:55,323
<i>Tarin?</i>

610
00:39:57,512 --> 00:39:59,614
The president has not responded.

611
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:01,356
Start the countdown.

612
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:05,443
<i>You need to stay with the bomb.
Make sure no one interferes with it.</i>

613
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,957
- <i>Did you hear me?</i>
- Yes, I heard you.

614
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:14,661
Your name will never be forgotten.

615
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:18,769
Your family will be honored
above all others.
