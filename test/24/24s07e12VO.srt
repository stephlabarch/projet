1
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:15,726
Jack.

2
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,429
Put down your weapon. Now!

3
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:20,799
What the hell's going on?

4
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,133
Where's Ryan Burnett? What?

5
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,102
Senator Mayer's chief of staff--
where is he?

6
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:26,070
Tony double-backed to
one of his contacts

7
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:28,008
who gave him information
of a second attack.

8
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:30,607
It's gonna take place here in
Washington within the hour.

9
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,209
Juma's operatives
are carrying it out.

10
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,960
Burnett's been supporting
them all along.

11
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:35,945
He knows where the attack's
gonna take place, so you can

12
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:39,087
either tell me where he is,
or I will find him myself.

13
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,183
Mr. Burnett,
you are a traitor and a terrorist.

14
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,853
I am not.

15
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:43,923
I love my country.

16
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,450
Mr. Bauer,
this is President Taylor.

17
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,123
Where's the target?!

18
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:53,063
What you're doing is against the law,
Mr. Bauer.

19
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:56,260
I am ordering you
to stand down.

20
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:58,500
Where's...?

21
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,273
Take Mr. Bauer away.
He's under arrest.

22
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,843
You should have come to me.

23
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:03,503
You should have
presented your case.

24
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:06,240
And would it really have
made a difference, ma'am?

25
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,641
Colonel Dubaku is dead.

26
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:15,182
<i>Laurent must never know about this,
or about his father's cowardice.</i>

27
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:16,950
There is no sign of my father.

28
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:19,820
Let me take his place
on the assault team.

29
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,120
Spoken like a true Dubaku.

30
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:23,821
Laurent, it is
time for us to go.

31
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:25,832
This is it, Larry, no question.

32
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,231
<i>They're moving out.</i>

33
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:29,160
Any idea what the
next target is?

34
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:30,930
<i>No.</i>

35
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:37,670
From our location, it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

36
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:46,413
Let's move.

37
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:49,310
<i>That's it.
I need to see her right now.</i>

38
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:52,580
Ms. Taylor, the president will
see you as soon as she's able.

39
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,950
Well, you tell her her
daughter is done waiting.

40
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,052
I'm going to the hospital
to be with my father.

41
00:02:57,157 --> 00:03:00,351
I think it would be a good idea to talk
to your mother before you do that.

42
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:06,060
The president's orders are that
you remain in the White House.

43
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:10,161
So if I try to leave, you will
actually physically restrain me?

44
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, that would never happen,
Ms. Taylor,

45
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:16,140
because I know you have too much
respect for your mother and her office

46
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,303
to ever let things
get that far.

47
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,842
Well done, Agent.

48
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,912
You've been at this a while.

49
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:27,110
Five administrations, ma'am.

50
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:42,762
Olivia, your mother asked me to
fill you in on what's happening.

51
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:46,603
Well, with all due respect, Ethan,
you're the last person she should
be sending.

52
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,743
There's about to be another
terrorist attack on this city.

53
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:52,810
That's why she wants
you to remain here.

54
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,070
Are we talking about
more planes going down?

55
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,512
We don't know.

56
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:58,881
But whatever's going to
happen will happen soon.

57
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,652
I'm heading to the Pentagon.

58
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:04,553
On top of all of this,
there's also the invasion to deal with.

59
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:10,322
So, bear in mind, your mother's
under tremendous pressure right now.

60
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,151
It's only a matter of time
before the media picks up

61
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:17,763
on the heightened
security measures.

62
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,790
I want to issue a statement
before that happens.

63
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:23,471
Play down the actual likelihood of an
attack, talk about the security measures

64
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:25,040
as being due diligence,
rather than...

65
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:26,170
No, Meredith.

66
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,571
The public deserves the truth.

67
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:28,872
We stress caution and calm,

68
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:32,052
but we acknowledge we have intel
about another terrorist action.

69
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:35,480
Yes, ma'am. Angela and I will have
something for you as soon as possible.

70
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,891
Madam President,
Larry Moss is calling in.

71
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:43,161
He says he's got a
lead on the attack.

72
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:44,620
Put him through.

73
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,533
Agent Moss,
you're on with the president.

74
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:49,902
Madam President, we've discovered
what we believe was a staging area

75
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,873
being used by terrorists on
the south shore of the Potomac,

76
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,371
near the ITP rail
and shipyards.

77
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,442
Madam President, we've identified
one of the men as General Juma.

78
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,440
What?!

79
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:01,710
Juma's in DC?

80
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,783
Yes, ma'am,
and we know that there are at least

81
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:07,513
a dozen other men involved in the
attack, and they are armed for a
small war.

82
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:10,251
Have you found evidence that tells
us where the target might be?

83
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:11,883
No, ma'am,
but we have search teams

84
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:13,951
out looking for the men,
and we're hoping that

85
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,692
Agent Walker has
more information.

86
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:20,231
She's the one who I.D.'d Juma, but,
uh, we've lost contact with her.

87
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:21,891
Lost contact?

88
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:25,260
Yes, Madam President, but we have every
reason to hope that she's still alive

89
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,233
and in pursuit of
the terrorists.

90
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:31,040
If she's out there,
ma'am, we'll find her.

91
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,360
Hold it right there!

92
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:52,790
I'm Agent Renee Walker, FBI.

93
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,771
Agent Walker, we just got an alert
on you. You need to call Larry Moss

94
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:57,360
at FBI right now.
Tell him there's gonna be

95
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,902
a terrorist attack
on the White House.

96
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:01,363
Yes, ma'am. I'll call it in right away.
This is Thompson...

97
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:16,553
Ranger Thompson,
please respond and report your location.

98
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:18,851
Ranger Thompson...

99
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,432
Bill.

100
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,503
The attorney general wants
you transferred to his custody

101
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,170
so he can file
criminal charges.

102
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,273
Have we learned anything
else about the attack?

103
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:36,573
I reached Tony.

104
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,841
He couldn't get any more
information from his guy.

105
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:42,443
According to the FBI,
Renee Walker followed a lead on her own

106
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:44,281
to an abandoned
warehouse on the Potomac.

107
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,180
Got a visual on a heavily-armed
commando unit led by Juma himself.

108
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,612
But she went missing right
after she called it in.

109
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,782
What do you mean, missing?

110
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,851
We're not sure.

111
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,953
The FBI's searching the area, but
there's no sign of her, or any evidence

112
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:56,322
telling us what the
target might be.

113
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:56,951
Burnett knows.

114
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,092
The president offered
him an immunity deal.

115
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,963
He turned it down,
hasn't said a word since.

116
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:02,990
Damn it, Bill,
he was talking when they stopped me.

117
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,833
Put me in a room with
him for five minutes,

118
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,363
and we can stop this
thing from happening.

119
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:07,873
Jack, even if I was
willing to release you,

120
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,771
he's being transported
to Kennedy Memorial.

121
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,241
You couldn't get access to him.

122
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,312
Fine. Then you do it.

123
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:13,470
You can get access.

124
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,241
I'm not trained in
coercive techniques.

125
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,912
This is not a maybe.

126
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:19,280
Ryan Burnett is an accessory
to a terrorist attack.

127
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:20,982
If you don't do this,
people will die.

128
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,010
Look, I'm not arguing about
what needs to be done.

129
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:24,852
But I can't do it.
I don't do that. It's not me.

130
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,023
That's not good enough. Jack!

131
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,552
Damn it, Bill.
That's not good enough.

132
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,691
You were the one who told me,
people who stand by--

133
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:32,023
they might as well help
them plant the bomb.

134
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:36,030
You can do this.

135
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,260
<i>Bill, you have
to do this.</i>

136
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:44,042
I can't, Jack.

137
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,103
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:51,413
Bill?

139
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,823
I can't.

140
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,312
This is it, General.

141
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:32,181
We're on the other
side of the conduit.

142
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,222
Are you in position?

143
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes, General.

144
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,625
I'll be ready for you.

145
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:40,967
What was that?

146
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,603
I thought I heard
you say something.

147
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,432
Just, uh, talking to myself.

148
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:50,043
Yeah. Hey, I tell you we're
having people over on Saturday?

149
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,410
Nothing fancy.
We're bringing in Chinese.

150
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,572
You think you're gonna
make it this time?

151
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,211
Oh. Chinese.

152
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:00,550
But I was looking forward
to Sheila's cooking.

153
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:25,810
All clear, General.

154
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:27,411
Excellent.

155
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:45,290
We'll have access
in ten seconds.

156
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:49,661
Once we're in, we'll have two minutes
until the proximity alarms come back up.

157
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:53,001
Five, four, three,

158
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,633
two, one...

159
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,303
Move!

160
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:40,680
I've accessed the Secret
Service tracking grid.

161
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,680
Where is she?

162
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:47,492
Right here in the Oval Office.

163
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,822
Let's go.

164
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,292
Clear.

165
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:33,703
We will meet resistance,
which we must counter quickly.

166
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,430
Silently.

167
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:39,572
We have nine minutes until the
next Secret Service roll call.

168
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,141
We must find the
president by then.

169
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:13,640
Yeah, I'll let you know,
as soon as it's ready for release.

170
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,673
Let go of the phone.

171
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:16,943
Huh.

172
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,380
Five minutes until
roll call, General.

173
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,180
Juma had your father killed.

174
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,282
What?

175
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,750
Listen to me,
I know that Dubaku is your father.

176
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:01,122
Juma's been lying to you.

177
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:02,650
Your father is dead.

178
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,162
My father is alive!

179
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,561
Juma had to make sure that
your father didn't talk.

180
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:09,561
So he sent a man named
Udo to murder him.

181
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,400
No. No, I...
I don't believe you.

182
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:13,931
Look, I was there
when Udo did it.

183
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:15,033
That's how I found you.

184
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,471
By following him back
to the rail car.

185
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:19,710
General Juma betrayed you.

186
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:22,613
You are lying. You are lying!

187
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:55,540
Renee!

188
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:59,042
I know the target.

189
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:02,350
Reissued warrants and
order for transport, sir.

190
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:08,550
Sorry, Jack.

191
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,161
This way, Mr. Bauer.

192
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:17,730
Bill Buchanan.

193
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:18,733
It's Larry Moss.

194
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,130
Renee Walker says the
target is the White House.

195
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:22,432
How good is her intel?

196
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,601
Firsthand. She says they're
getting in via subterranean access.

197
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:26,772
I'll initiate a lockdown.

198
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,411
You alert CIRG.

199
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:30,813
This is Bill Buchanan.

200
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:33,781
I have confirmation the White House
is a target of a terrorist attack.

201
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:36,281
Condition red. Repeat:
Condition red. Secure the president.

202
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:38,083
Get to your posts.

203
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:41,822
Jack, I could use your help.

204
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:43,763
I need to know you'll
do exactly as I say.

205
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,790
You have my word.

206
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,431
Where's the president now?

207
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:49,531
Oval Office.

208
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:55,432
What's the meaning of this?
You need to come with us.

209
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,203
The White House is
under attack. What?!

210
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:58,700
Madam President, we need to go.

211
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:02,571
Ma'am, we need to go right now.

212
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:03,512
Ms. Taylor.

213
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:05,140
I've got the
president's daughter.

214
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:06,650
We're on our way
to the lockdown.

215
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,753
Men are down.
There's no safe path out.

216
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,920
We need to secure her in
the first floor lockdown.

217
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:12,851
Bill, we're clear.

218
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,830
What the hell is he doing here?
He's with me.

219
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,821
Madam President, right now,
you need all the help you can get.

220
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:19,390
How is this happening?
Where's my daughter?

221
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,392
Aaron Pierce is taking her to lockdown
as we speak, but we need to move.

222
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:26,302
Agents in zones five,
seven and nine, please respond.

223
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:27,800
Five, seven and nine, respond.

224
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,201
I can't reach anyone
in the quadrant.

225
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,301
Juma's men are headed
straight for us.

226
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,873
They know where she is.

227
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,641
They're tracking her, Bill.

228
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,182
Madam President,
let me see your tracker.

229
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,992
Bill, what's the most direct route
to the lockdown? From the east.

230
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,081
I'll head west with the
tracker and draw them away.

231
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:45,480
You go with Jack.

232
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:48,920
Agent Bauer.

233
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,092
This is your house.
I'll follow.

234
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:55,291
We're moving the
president to lockdown.

235
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:59,503
Agent Hovis, we've got agents
down in multiple quadrants.

236
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:00,871
We need reinforcements, sir.

237
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:04,042
Copy that.
We're on our way to the lockdown now.

238
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,870
Let's go.

239
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,412
General.

240
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:15,313
The president has
left the Oval Office.

241
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:17,920
She's heading down
the west corridor.

242
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:20,252
Udo, take your team that way.

243
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:22,391
We'll trap her in between us.

244
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,790
We're getting close to
the president, sir.

245
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,351
Up ahead, around this corner.

246
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,232
The president's tracker, sir.

247
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,402
They know we're here.

248
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,500
They're moving the
president to the lockdown.

249
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:15,011
Find her.

250
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:26,922
Take him. We need hostages.

251
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,792
Start gathering 'em up.

252
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,960
Let's move.

253
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,782
We've engaged hostiles on
the way to the lockdown.

254
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:50,570
We do not have a visual
on the president.

255
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,111
We're still two minutes away.

256
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:55,812
Get up!

257
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:57,422
Get up! Get up! Get up!

258
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,291
Move it! Come on!
Come on, move it! Come on!

259
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,621
Aaron, it's Jack. I'm with the
president, approaching lockdown. Where
are you?

260
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,460
We're still upstairs, Jack.

261
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:10,501
Move! Move! WOMAN: Please...

262
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,563
Hostiles are in
control of the area.

263
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:15,601
Looking for a way past
them to the lockdown.

264
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,783
Copy that.
Juma's men are closing on our position.

265
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:19,971
You're going to have about
30 seconds to get here

266
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,160
before I have to seal this door.
PIERCE: Understood.

267
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,343
You will not close this door until my
daughter gets here. Madam President,
right now,

268
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:27,041
your life is the priority,
whether you like it or not.

269
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:28,181
Please, step inside.

270
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,201
Madam President,
are you all right?

271
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:48,063
Aaron, it's Jack.

272
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,730
We're sealed off
in the lockdown.

273
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:51,430
We came under attack.
We didn't have a choice.

274
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,073
We couldn't have made
it anyway, Jack.

275
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:55,212
We'll try to find a way
out of the building.

276
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:56,240
Copy that, Aaron...

277
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,042
Jack.

278
00:18:58,216 --> 00:18:59,511
Jack, do you read me?

279
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:03,982
Aaron, it's Jack. Do you copy?

280
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,551
Damn it.
Juma's cut off our communication.

281
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,623
I need to know that
my daughter's safe.

282
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,521
Madam President,
I can't answer that yet.

283
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:19,032
Abo.

284
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:48,462
General Juma,
they brought in reinforcements.

285
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:52,002
I don't know how much longer we can
hold them off from your position.

286
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,600
Stand by.

287
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:56,232
Ngozi?

288
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:02,270
Agents are moving in from all
directions; we will be
heavily outnumbered.

289
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:07,652
Does Secret Service know the
president is secured in the lockdown?

290
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,653
The only ones who saw are dead.

291
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:12,052
Put me on to their
communications channel.

292
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,052
Go ahead, sir.

293
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,622
This is General Juma.

294
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:18,322
I have the president.

295
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,832
Evacuate immediately,
or she will die.

296
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,000
I need proof you have the president
before I can give that order.

297
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,970
Let us speak to her.
Who is this?

298
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,473
Special Agent Hovis.

299
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,712
Agent Hovis,
move your men out of the building

300
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:37,513
and beyond the fence line,
or I will kill the president.

301
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:40,751
And her death will
be on your head.

302
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:45,020
Agent Hovis?

303
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:46,650
We're pulling back.

304
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,750
All agents,
fall back immediately!

305
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:52,521
I repeat: All agents fall back.

306
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:06,240
General, Secret
Service is retreating.

307
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:12,511
They are retreating, General.

308
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:13,851
All of them?

309
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:16,551
Yes, sir.

310
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:19,383
Gather all the hostages
and bring them here.

311
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:24,121
Lock down the exits. Move. Sir.

312
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,972
Confirming Secret Service
retreat in western quadrant.

313
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:41,510
Copy, General.

314
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,611
The only reason Secret
Service would retreat

315
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,482
is if they thought Juma
had the president.

316
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:50,322
But that man, Bauer,
said he g t my mother into the lockdown.

317
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,182
Juma's bluffing them.

318
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,553
We need to get out of here
and let our people know that

319
00:21:54,726 --> 00:21:56,993
as soon as possible so they
can retake the building.

320
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,862
Get out of here? How?
They're everywhere.

321
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,522
Move it! Shh!

322
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,561
Keep your hands on your head--
move it!

323
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:07,571
Go! Move it!

324
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:10,372
Go! Move!

325
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,713
Move it! Move!

326
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:20,783
Move it!

327
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:21,851
Come on, move!

328
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:22,980
Move it! Move your feet.

329
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:23,980
Get out here.

330
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:25,051
Move it. Move it.

331
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:26,153
Right here. Keep going.

332
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:27,390
Come on. Move it!

333
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,251
Sit down! Sit down!
Everyone down!

334
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:30,891
Everyone down!

335
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:32,290
Get down. Down now!

336
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:36,632
Get down! Turn around.
Turn around.

337
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,513
Can you open it?

338
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:51,180
Yes.

339
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:54,052
Assuming the specifications
Hodges gave us are correct.

340
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:55,152
How long?

341
00:22:55,316 --> 00:22:56,781
15 minutes.

342
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:29,803
We confronted them in one of
the first floor corridors.

343
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,730
At that point,
Juma ordered us to retreat,

344
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:35,241
threatening to kill the
president if we didn't comply.

345
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:37,141
But he never gave a
visual confirmation

346
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,673
he was holding the president?
No, he didn't, but I felt,

347
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:41,643
at that point,
I had no choice but to pull back.

348
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:43,280
His men were killing
civilians and agents.

349
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:45,282
Any idea how many people
are still trapped inside?

350
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:47,683
Cross-checking the evacuees
with the White House manifest.

351
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:48,950
So far, it looks like 53.

352
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:52,590
Any Secret Service?
HOVIS: As far as I know,

353
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,453
we have no agents left
in there still alive.

354
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,560
They'll be prepared to storm the
building as soon as the order is given.

355
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:04,533
Yeah, well, at this point, that order
has to be given by the vice president.

356
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,773
What's his status?

357
00:24:05,935 --> 00:24:08,743
Secret Service has him en
route to a secure location.

358
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,242
All right,
let me know as soon as he's locked down.

359
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,143
And Hovis, I need an infrared
SAT-SCAN of the building.

360
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:15,482
Highest resolution possible.

361
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,042
Got it.

362
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,583
You didn't tell me that Jack
was in the White House.

363
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,422
He was under arrest.

364
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,590
Being held under guard when
the attack took place.

365
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,062
Under arrest for what?

366
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:35,530
He found out an aide to Senator Mayer
named Burnett was part of
the conspiracy.

367
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:38,770
He was caught torturing him...

368
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:40,830
in the White House.

369
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:44,542
Almost killed the man
before he was stopped.

370
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:51,311
Renee, the president is our priority,
not Jack Bauer.

371
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:52,613
Are we clear on that? Clear.

372
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,453
Are you sure? Yes.

373
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,693
They're bringing
in more hostages.

374
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:08,262
Get down! Now!

375
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:10,201
Get in here! Sit!

376
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,473
No talking.

377
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:17,042
I don't see Olivia.

378
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:18,843
Madam President,
that's good news.

379
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,040
I know Aaron Pierce.

380
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:23,441
He will do everything in his power to
make sure that your daughter is safe.

381
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:25,483
This is the White House,
for God's sake.

382
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,703
How is it possible that they were able
to get around our security protocols?

383
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:30,183
There's only one explanation.

384
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:31,551
They had help on the inside.

385
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:33,851
From whom?

386
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,360
Oh, this is insane.

387
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:45,600
Juma must realize that there's no
way for him to get out of this alive.

388
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,601
I'm afraid he does.

389
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:47,702
This is his endgame.

390
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:50,482
He came here to make a statement,
and he's willing to die for it.

391
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:53,371
As soon as the rescue teams realize
that you're secure, they'll move in.

392
00:25:53,477 --> 00:25:55,840
It's only a matter of time.

393
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:57,782
What's he doing?

394
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,682
Is that some kind
of explosive? No.

395
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,113
Mr. Bauer?

396
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:02,951
Oh, my God.

397
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:05,223
They've got the access codes.

398
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:07,220
I need to get into that panel.

399
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:08,560
Is there something I can do?

400
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,262
Yeah, give me that
toolbox over there.

401
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:11,832
Put it on the table.

402
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:31,552
Damn it.

403
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:39,691
Madam President,
plug the cord into the wall, please.

404
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,350
Now.

405
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:51,700
Okay.

406
00:26:57,945 --> 00:26:59,241
General.

407
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:05,042
What's wrong?

408
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:06,083
It just went dead.

409
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:09,653
Somehow, they must have disabled
the circuitry from inside.

410
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:12,321
Then, we'll use C4 to
blow open the door.

411
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,393
We'll have to drill sinkholes
into each of the 11 locking rods.

412
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,521
It will take too long.

413
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:20,591
Depending on how the steel is hardened,
C4 might not even work.

414
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:24,433
Then we'll find another way.

415
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,480
There can be no room for doubt.

416
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:44,582
We have the president trapped.

417
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:48,663
We open up that door,
we become a part of history.

418
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:51,491
<i>We will find
another way.</i>

419
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,252
Yes.

420
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:15,621
Um...

421
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:17,282
just a moment.

422
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:22,223
Call came in on the
dedicated uplink.

423
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:23,521
I heard it.

424
00:28:23,696 --> 00:28:25,363
It's him, sir.

425
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:33,032
Put him on speaker.

426
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,740
General, didn't expect to be
hearing from you directly.

427
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,411
What is it I can do for you?

428
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:41,912
We have a problem.

429
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,882
The president is
secured in the lockdown.

430
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,953
Well, we prepared you
for that possibility.

431
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:49,220
We gave you the specs for
the locking mechanism.

432
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:51,921
They shorted the lock
out from the inside.

433
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:54,850
I need you to find
me another way in.

434
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,360
General, I've given you
everything I have to give.

435
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,163
My part in this thing is over.

436
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:10,041
Are you forgetting that you
don't have the shipment yet?

437
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,413
Now, General,
I expect you to be an honorable man.

438
00:29:13,578 --> 00:29:14,441
We made a deal.

439
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,080
We held up our end
of the bargain.

440
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:17,511
We got you in the White House.

441
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:19,311
I expect you to hold up yours.

442
00:29:19,486 --> 00:29:21,110
I don't care about
your expectations.

443
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:25,950
You help me, or I will destroy that
shipment before it ever arrives to you.

444
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:28,492
Hang on.

445
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:31,093
Well...

446
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:34,091
Seaton, what do you think?

447
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,730
Can he do what he says?

448
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:38,331
The shipment's not due in the
port for another two hours.

449
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:41,940
His men will have plenty of time
to destroy it, render it useless.

450
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:51,881
General?

451
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:55,211
Tell me-- who else is in the
lockdown with the president?

452
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:58,380
My men saw her enter
with another man.

453
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:01,692
Well, I'm looking at the
White House manifest,

454
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:07,160
and according to this, Olivia Taylor
is presently in the building with you.

455
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:09,561
The president's daughter?

456
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:11,030
Are you sure?

457
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,772
Their system logs everyone
in and out electronically.

458
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,841
If it says that she's in there,
she's in there.

459
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:20,542
Now, you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll
get the president to open that door.

460
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,913
Your shipment will
arrive as planned.

461
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:25,880
Thank you.

462
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,220
There, you see-- stress.

463
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:32,422
Stress...

464
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:35,961
is the fertilizer
of creativity.

465
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:38,661
Let's play some darts.

466
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:43,030
The president's daughter is
somewhere in the White House.

467
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,732
Let's find her.

468
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:54,613
Raise your heads.

469
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:56,612
Show me your faces.

470
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,363
What do you think's going on?

471
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:18,461
I asked you a question,
Mr. Buchanan.

472
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:23,641
You think I made the
wrong call with Bauer.

473
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:27,510
You think that if I'd signed off
on him torturing Ryan Burnett,

474
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:29,213
all of this could
have been avoided?

475
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:34,611
You don't know what
I'm thinking, Senator.

476
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:43,191
She's not here.

477
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:47,891
Go ahead and find her
and bring her to me.

478
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:12,663
What happened?

479
00:32:12,828 --> 00:32:14,593
What did you see?
The door's guarded.

480
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:16,293
Well, there's got to
be another way out.

481
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,862
There are only three exits to this wing,
and they're all covered.

482
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:20,593
The windows are
sealed and hardened.

483
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:22,253
Unbreakable. We have
to let them know

484
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,403
the terrorists are bluffing;
that they don't have my mother.

485
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,773
Our only option is
to get a signal out.

486
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:29,842
We can do it from the windows of
the residence. Okay, okay, good.

487
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:32,012
You'll be safer if I leave
you in a secure area.

488
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:34,311
I'll get the signal out
and come back for you.

489
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:36,911
I'm not gonna sit and hide in
some damn vent, Agent Pierce.

490
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:41,151
Ma'am, it is a long way, and we're
probably gonna encounter more of
Juma's men.

491
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:42,322
It's too dangerous.

492
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:43,582
I don't care.

493
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:46,050
I'm going with you,
and don't try to argue.

494
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:47,792
We don't have the time.

495
00:32:48,825 --> 00:32:50,060
Okay.

496
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:51,822
Stay behind me.

497
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,742
Agent Moss,
SAT-SCAN's all set up here.

498
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:14,681
We can see the cluster of hostages,
but not the individual bodies.

499
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:15,903
That the best they can do?

500
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:17,612
They can't boost the resolution on this?
No, sir.

501
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:20,921
The White House is one of the most
heavily shielded buildings in the world.

502
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:22,251
Yeah, got it.

503
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:23,920
The vice president's ready.

504
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:25,822
They're initiating
communication. Thanks.

505
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:28,090
Yeah.

506
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,631
Give us the room.

507
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:42,442
You're on with the
Vice President.

508
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:46,683
Mr. Vice President, I'm Special Agent
Moss, head of the FBI's DC branch.

509
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:48,443
This is Agent Walker.

510
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:50,452
I've been briefed on
the general situation.

511
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:52,220
What are the latest
facts on the ground?

512
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:55,423
There's nothing further from General
Juma, but an infrared scan of
the building

513
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:58,951
shows he's holding the hostages in a
hallway outside the Roosevelt Room.

514
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:01,962
Now this is very possibly
good news for the president.

515
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:03,190
Explain.

516
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,962
The area's not one of the more
defensible places in the building.

517
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:09,000
Tactically, it makes no sense for
Juma to have chosen it as a base.

518
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:12,573
However, the area is adjacent
to the ground floor lockdown,

519
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,800
which we know the
president was en route to.

520
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:17,572
So, you think the president
made it into the lockdown?

521
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:20,211
That's our best explanation
for him being there.

522
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:22,310
We're therefore are
asking you to authorize

523
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:25,350
the rescue operation before Juma
manages to penetrate the lockdown.

524
00:34:29,926 --> 00:34:32,760
Do you have any other evidence
that supports your theory

525
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:35,762
that the president
is in the lockdown?

526
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:38,792
There's the fact that he
couldn't produce the president

527
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:40,862
when we asked him to
prove that he had her.

528
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,880
Couldn't or wouldn't?

529
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:44,132
You can't be certain which one it is,
can you?

530
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:45,933
Certainty's not possible
in this case, sir.

531
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:49,471
We're giving you our best estimation
and we urge you to allow us to launch.

532
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:52,341
What if you're wrong?

533
00:34:52,515 --> 00:34:54,040
What if Juma does
have the president?

534
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:56,783
He will kill her as soon as he
realizes what you're doing.

535
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:59,181
Inaction has its own risks,
too, sir.

536
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:01,322
The more time Juma has to
reinforce his position,

537
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:04,291
the more difficult it'll be to take
the building and to save lives.

538
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,360
I understand.

539
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:08,693
But my priority must be
the president's life.

540
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:12,603
Prudence dictates that I hold off
on authorizing the rescue operation

541
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,630
until we can be more
certain of her status.

542
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:18,032
Mr. Vice President, terrorists
are in control of the White House.

543
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,972
I would ask you to
consider if prudence

544
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:22,440
is the appropriate response
in this situation.

545
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,610
I thank you for your thoughts,
Agent Walker.

546
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:31,650
Until you can provide me with more
intel on what's going on in there,

547
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:35,720
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

548
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:39,691
Keep me apprised of any
further developments.

549
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:44,763
All he's interested in
is covering his own ass.

550
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:46,262
He's the Vice President.

551
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,260
Right now,
he's calling the shots.

552
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:51,431
It was the right call, sir.

553
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,640
You can't order an operation that
results in the president's death

554
00:35:54,748 --> 00:35:56,100
and your own
elevation to the job.

555
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:57,571
It would be
politically untenable.

556
00:35:57,745 --> 00:36:02,853
Never let anyone hear you
talking like that, Derek.

557
00:36:03,016 --> 00:36:04,350
Understood?

558
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:05,552
Yes, sir.

559
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,241
Oh, God...

560
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:31,241
Oh, my God, Aaron!

561
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:32,942
They would've
heard those shots,

562
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:35,410
so you're going to need to
get the signal out before they

563
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:39,153
get back. There's a security kit
behind that door in the bureau.

564
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:42,052
It's got first aid
and a flashlight.

565
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:44,322
You'll flash Morse
Code out the window.

566
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:46,151
Reach in my jacket.
I got a pen.

567
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:48,093
Here.

568
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:49,991
Give it to me.

569
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:52,663
Give me your hand.

570
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:59,432
This is called "Code Green." A dot is
a short blink; a dash is a long one.

571
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:02,370
"Code Green" will
signal them to move in.

572
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:03,912
Go!

573
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:12,921
Okay... okay...

574
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:19,090
Okay...

575
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:23,392
Okay.

576
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,760
Okay. Okay.

577
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:36,403
General Juma,
I have the president's daughter.

578
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:42,482
Bring him.

579
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:07,860
Sources have confirmed that the
siege inside the White House

580
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,903
began approximately
40 minutes ago.

581
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:13,600
We do not yet have confirmation on
the number of hostages being held,

582
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:15,170
or if the president
is among them.

583
00:38:15,277 --> 00:38:20,043
Behind me, you can see dozens of
tactical assault units standing by.

584
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:23,141
Government analysts tell us the
order to launch any operation

585
00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:26,411
in these circumstances would
rest with the vice president.

586
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:32,123
General, I discovered fiber-optic
cameras embedded in the chandelier.

587
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,481
Sit!

588
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:57,141
Get me a chair.

589
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:58,581
Yes, General.

590
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:13,591
He spotted the cameras.

591
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:18,602
Give me a secure channel.

592
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:21,103
Go ahead, sir.

593
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:27,213
President Taylor,
I see now that you've been watching us.

594
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:28,812
Good.

595
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:31,980
There is something I
think you should see.

596
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:41,262
God, no.

597
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:49,462
If you don't open the door, I'm
going to cut out your daughter's eyes

598
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:53,030
one by one.

599
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:58,413
And then I'm going to
cut out her tongue...

600
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:00,542
...and then her head.

601
00:40:00,718 --> 00:40:02,281
Mom, don't listen!

602
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,380
I know what you're thinking.

603
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:07,952
How do you know if you open
the door that I won't kill her?

604
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:11,453
All you need to know is that
I most certainly will kill her

605
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,292
if you don't.

606
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:19,463
Open the door.

607
00:40:19,636 --> 00:40:21,401
Madam President, I can't!
No. Open the door.

608
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,302
Open the door! I can't!

609
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:26,202
That is my daughter out there.

610
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:27,931
Do you understand?

611
00:40:28,107 --> 00:40:30,073
I've already lost my son.

612
00:40:30,247 --> 00:40:32,773
Have you any idea what
it's like to lose a child?

613
00:40:32,948 --> 00:40:36,543
 Madam President, I am genuinely
sorry, but I cannot let them take you.

614
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:38,583
There is nothing you
can do for her now.

615
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:42,183
Do you have children, Jack?

616
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:45,752
I have a daughter.

617
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:48,923
Could you do what
you're asking me to do?

618
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:51,262
Just stand by and
watch her butchered?

619
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:52,931
No, ma'am.

620
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:55,803
But I am not the President
of the United States.

621
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:58,533
<i>Well, I am
the president.</i>

622
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,070
And I am ordering you
to open that door.

623
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:23,661
You're running out of time.

624
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,603
Mom...

625
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,933
Perhaps this will make your
mother decide more quickly.

626
00:41:57,437 --> 00:41:59,190
Mom, you shouldn't have...

627
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:03,301
I wouldn't let them
hurt you, darling.

628
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,840
Damn it, Bauer.

629
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:11,001
What have you done?!

630
00:42:17,988 --> 00:42:20,613
All right, General,
you've got me now.

631
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:24,693
There's no reason to
hold anyone else.

632
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:26,451
Let them go.

633
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:35,360
You...

634
00:42:35,535 --> 00:42:37,831
don't give orders to me.

635
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:42,703
Get the camera ready
for her statement.

636
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:45,140
What statement?

637
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:49,011
The last one you'll ever give.

638
00:42:49,125 --> 00:52:19,191
Oh, my God, Aaron!

639
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:21,241
They would've
heard those shots,

640
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,713
so you're going to need to
get the signal out before they

641
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:27,451
get back. There's a security kit
behind that door in the bureau.

642
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:30,352
It's got first aid
and a flashlight.

643
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:32,621
You'll flash Morse
Code out the window.

644
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:34,452
Reach in my jacket.
I got a pen.

645
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,391
Here.

646
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:38,293
Give it to me.

647
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:40,960
Give me your hand.

648
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:47,731
This is called "Code Green." A dot is
a short blink; a dash is a long one.

649
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:50,672
"Code Green" will
signal them to move in.

650
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,211
Go!

651
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:01,220
Okay... okay...

652
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:07,392
Okay...

653
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:11,693
Okay.

654
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:15,060
Okay. Okay.

655
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:24,700
General Juma,
I have the president's daughter.

656
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:30,781
Bring him.

657
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:41,522
<i>Your life takes you down
many different paths. </i>

658
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:44,180
<i>Because you're more
than one thing. </i>

659
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:59,432
<i>So is VENZA. </i>

660
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:07,860
Sources have confirmed that the
siege inside the White House

661
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,901
began approximately
40 minutes ago.

662
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:13,603
We do not yet have confirmation on
the number of hostages being held,

663
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,173
or if the president
is among them.

664
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:20,041
Behind me, you can see dozens of
tactical assault units standing by.

665
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:23,141
Government analysts tell us the
order to launch any operation

666
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:26,410
in these circumstances would
rest with the vice president.

667
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:32,123
General, I discovered fiber-optic
cameras embedded in the chandelier.

668
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,480
Sit!

669
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:57,143
Get me a chair.

670
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:58,581
Yes, General.

671
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:13,591
He spotted the cameras.

672
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,603
Give me a secure channel.

673
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,102
Go ahead, sir.

674
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:27,210
President Taylor,
I see now that you've been watching us.

675
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:28,811
Good.

676
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:31,980
There is something I
think you should see.

677
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,262
God, no.

678
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:49,460
If you don't open the door, I'm
going to cut out your daughter's eyes

679
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,033
one by one.

680
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:58,412
And then I'm going to
cut out her tongue...

681
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:00,542
...and then her head.

682
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,281
Mom, don't listen!

683
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,383
I know what you're thinking.

684
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:07,951
How do you know if you open
the door that I won't kill her?

685
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:11,453
All you need to know is that
I most certainly will kill her

686
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,292
if you don't.

687
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:19,460
Open the door.

688
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:21,400
Madam President, I can't!
No. Open the door.

689
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,300
Open the door! I can't!

690
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:26,202
That is my daughter out there.

691
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:27,931
Do you understand?

692
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,072
I've already lost my son.

693
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:32,771
Have you any idea what
it's like to lose a child?

694
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:36,540
 Madam President, I am genuinely
sorry, but I cannot let them take you.

695
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,580
There is nothing you
can do for her now.

696
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:42,182
Do you have children, Jack?

697
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:45,751
I have a daughter.

698
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:48,922
Could you do what
you're asking me to do?

699
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:51,260
Just stand by and
watch her butchered?

700
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:52,933
No, ma'am.

701
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:55,801
But I am not the President
of the United States.

702
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:58,532
<i>Well, I am
the president.</i>

703
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:02,071
And I am ordering you
to open that door.

704
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,660
You're running out of time.

705
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:29,601
Mom...

706
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:32,933
Perhaps this will make your
mother decide more quickly.

707
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,190
Mom, you shouldn't have...

708
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:03,303
I wouldn't let them
hurt you, darling.

709
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,840
Damn it, Bauer.

710
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,001
What have you done?!

711
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:20,611
All right, General,
you've got me now.

712
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:24,691
There's no reason to
hold anyone else.

713
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:26,451
Let them go.

714
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:35,363
You...

715
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:37,832
don't give orders to me.

716
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:42,700
Get the camera ready
for her statement.

717
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:45,143
What statement?

718
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:49,612
The last one you'll ever give.
