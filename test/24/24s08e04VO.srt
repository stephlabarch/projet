3
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:16,474
Sir, we just found this
among Meredith Reed's personal effects.

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,499
It's a dedicated key card, UN issue.

5
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,821
- To who?
- President Hassan and his family.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,826
It accesses their private residence.

7
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:24,732
We got her.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,317
I want to know where you got it.

9
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:28,903
Omar gave it to me.

10
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:32,663
I gave Miss Reed this key card
for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.

11
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:37,203
Sir, are you confirming a romantic
involvement with Meredith Reed?

12
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:39,830
I trust your complete discretion
in this matter.

13
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:41,666
We have a problem.

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,287
My brother confessed to the affair.
I don't know if the frame will hold.

15
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:48,130
There is no reason
to diverge from the plan.

16
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:49,216
How much longer?

17
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,206
Your brother will be dead
before the hour is out.

18
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,821
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:57,401
I thought I told you
to leave me alone.

20
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,175
CTU.

21
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,029
Senior Data Analyst.

22
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:03,521
Well, sounds like an important job.

23
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:06,774
- Damn it, what do you want from me?
- A place to crash, for starters.

24
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,069
You can stay the night.
I want you out tomorrow.

25
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,628
We're evacuating immediately,
due to a possible bomb threat.

26
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:17,896
You and Mr. Kanin need to move now.

27
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:19,787
President Hassan,
if you'll follow me.

28
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,546
He's in the third car.
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,549
This is going down now.

30
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,618
You can either stand here and do nothing
or you can help me stop it.

31
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,179
Stop Hassan's car now.

32
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:39,149
The assassin
is part of the evacuation detail.

33
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:40,558
There is no bomb in the UN.

34
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:43,488
It's too late.
Hassan's car just exited the tunnel.

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,813
You need to stop that car,
or Hassan's a dead man.

36
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,692
What was that?

37
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,319
What happened?

38
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:16,927
This is a damn disaster.

39
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,097
- You don't know what happened?
- How is Hassan? Is he all right?

40
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,142
We don't know yet.
It appears the bomb threat at the UN

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,333
was a hoax designed
to get him out of the building.

42
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,514
"It appears"?

43
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,064
An IED was planted
on Hassan's evacuation route.

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,864
And you drove him right into it!

45
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,110
One of our agents
detected the ambush,

46
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,240
tried to head him off
just as the bomb exploded.

47
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,226
You better pray
he got there in time.

48
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:54,103
Security there! Now!

49
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:01,430
Stand down! I'm with CTU.

50
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,762
Sir, we need to move you
to another vehicle. Now.

51
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:11,690
You do not want to stay here.

52
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,379
Get in.

53
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,756
Move! Move!

54
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,432
- Thank God you're okay.
- <i>I got lucky.</i>

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,450
Hassan escaped the blast, he's fine.

56
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:48,853
He's heading toward CTU,

57
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,209
<i>eastbound on 48th Street
in a black SUV.</i>

58
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,321
Got him.
Mr. Hastings, here.

59
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:54,846
Hassan, he's safe.

60
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:58,069
The assassin was posing
as a part of the security team.

61
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,532
I know. We got the info from Chloe.
The police are putting up a cordon now.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,036
<i>Are you there?</i>

63
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,039
I've got the suspect,
he's dressed as a cop.

64
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,668
Entering a white low-rise
north of the UN.

65
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:16,186
- Call it in! I'm in pursuit!
- I need to put out a priority APB.

66
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,339
Move, move!

67
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,333
What is it now?

68
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:53,022
They've got a lead on the assassin.
4722 East 47th Street.

69
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:55,586
- I'm gonna need my weapon.
- Your bag's right behind my seat.

70
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,349
East 47th Street...
That's just above the UN.

71
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:04,345
You're gonna need to turn now.
Now! Now!

72
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,228
UN Four, come in.
UN Four, this is CTU Two.

73
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:14,688
Come in, please.

74
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,816
- I'm sorry, I can't reach him.
- Try again.

75
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:21,070
- That's my husband in that car.
- They're not answering.

76
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,031
- I have to go to him.
- Ma'am, you need to remain in the car.

77
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,199
Stay calm.

78
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,409
I'll try another number.

79
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:32,789
Where are you?

80
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,793
Yes, we're safe.
Dalia, Kayla and myself.

81
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:39,008
I need to know about my brother.

82
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:40,284
He's alive.

83
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:41,949
<i>He survived.</i>

84
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,260
How is he?

85
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:47,596
He's alive.

86
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,571
God is with us.

87
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,354
Can you tell me what happened?

88
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,985
A car in the motorcade

89
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:02,851
swerved in front of him.

90
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:05,114
They're locking down
the entire area.

91
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:07,864
What would you suggest we do?

92
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:10,535
It's over.

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,140
<i>Get out now.</i>

94
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:15,769
<i>It can't be long
before they realize it's you.</i>

95
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,538
Sir, please stay in the car!

96
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:29,749
Please, sir.

97
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:31,682
I need you to get back in the car.

98
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,173
Get on your knees.

99
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,155
Slide your weapon back to me.

100
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,111
Slowly...

101
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:27,518
Slow...

102
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,116
Now...

103
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,874
you're going to walk me out of here.

104
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:35,739
Call in.

105
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,547
Say the southwest corner is clear.

106
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,127
Tell them to move the search team
to the northeast.

107
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,094
Do it.

108
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,404
You want to live?

109
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,218
Make the call.

110
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:01,035
This is Cole Ortiz
in the southwest corner of the building.

111
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,210
I'm in pursuit of the assassin.

112
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,152
He's with me now.

113
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:18,121
You okay?

114
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:19,726
You okay?

115
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,083
Yeah, I'm okay.

116
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,888
Son of a bitch.

117
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:57,368
Mr. President, Brian Hastings.
We spoke on the phone.

118
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,879
We're glad you're here.
Please follow me.

119
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:05,614
Is my family here?

120
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:08,587
No, sir. We'll try
and get you all together shortly.

121
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:11,476
- Are they all right?
- Your wife and daughter are fine.

122
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:12,592
And my brother?

123
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,263
Was he hurt?

124
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,291
It appears your brother
was involved with the attack.

125
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:27,855
- My brother?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,930
That can't be right.

127
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:32,441
Bring him to me.
I need to talk to him.

128
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,907
Unfortunately, we don't know
where he is at the moment.

129
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:37,825
Then how can you be sure it was him?

130
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,283
Mr. President, after the explosion,

131
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,498
he killed one of my men
to facilitate his own escape.

132
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:47,184
There were witnesses,
including your wife and daughter.

133
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,379
He's the insider
we've been looking for.

134
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:51,785
There's no doubt.

135
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,311
Excuse me.
I'm sorry for interrupting.

136
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,272
You asked for any updates
about the assassin.

137
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,263
- And?
- He's dead.

138
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,558
Jack just called it in. He uplinked
some video footage that you need to see.

139
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,437
I'll be there in a minute.

140
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,252
- Don't let me keep you from your job.
- Thank you, sir.

141
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:08,357
No, thank you. I owe you my life.

142
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:10,983
Conference room.

143
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:15,968
Meredith Reed, the woman
you brought here for questioning,

144
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,917
- where is she?
- Still here.

145
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,769
Looks like she'll be cleared
of any wrongdoing.

146
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:23,584
- I'd like to talk to her.
- I'll arrange it.

147
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:26,022
Excuse me.

148
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,523
- I saw that.
- What?

149
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,797
The way you looked at me
when he thanked me.

150
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:35,062
- He should have been thanking you?
- I was actually thinking

151
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,037
he should thank Jack, then Cole,
then maybe me.

152
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,063
I underestimated you, Chloe.

153
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,978
You saw what was really going on,
I did not.

154
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:52,716
It was a major save.

155
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:55,509
And my report will state that.

156
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,125
- You have some video to show me.
- Yes, sir. Take a look.

157
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:11,783
These are images uplinked by Jack Bauer
from the bomb site.

158
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,713
It's the assassin
who was targeting Hassan.

159
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,621
- We have an ID?
- Not yet.

160
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,510
But I believe
we do have a workable lead.

161
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,166
These are tattoos off the two men

162
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,431
who attempted to take out
our informant this afternoon.

163
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:23,974
Same as the assassin.

164
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,102
We believe they indicate membership
in a particular Russian crime syndicate.

165
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:30,849
What's a Russian gang have against
the leader of the Islamic Republic?

166
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,976
I don't know.
Could just be hired muscle.

167
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,527
But when the photos arrived,
I ran them by the FBI.

168
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,463
Turns out, they had an agent undercover
working with the Russian mob here

169
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:39,698
several years ago.

170
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,226
- A woman.
- Contact her.

171
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,709
Already done.
I have a helicopter bringing her in now.

172
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,680
I think you worked with her.

173
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:47,956
Renee Walker.

174
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,792
Says here she's no longer
with the FBI.

175
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,086
It's true.
She resigned over an internal dispute.

176
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,839
Meaning she was fired
and her records have been sealed.

177
00:11:57,454 --> 00:12:00,635
- What are we getting into here?
- We are only using her to brief us.

178
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:03,731
These Russian groups are secretive
to the point of paranoia.

179
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,058
She's the only one
who ever got close.

180
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,444
<i>President Omar Hassan
was not harmed in the attack,</i>

181
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,113
<i>and has since been taken
to a secure location.</i>

182
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,778
<i>Confirmed fatalities
now stand at three...</i>

183
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,072
<i>... including a police officer.</i>

184
00:12:31,394 --> 00:12:32,876
Why is my brother still alive?

185
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:34,610
You're upset, Farhad.

186
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,880
- Justifiably.
- Your man failed!

187
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,832
Once you have the materials,

188
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,705
your brother, his peace conference,
none of that matters.

189
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,387
Isn't that what you told me?

190
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:46,431
All you have to do is stay calm
and stick to your plan.

191
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,936
Or should I be looking
for another buyer?

192
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:53,074
I'll be there soon.

193
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:54,231
Good.

194
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:57,317
We'll have a nice meal waiting.
And we'll talk.

195
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:21,789
I've been informed
that the bomb threat was a hoax.

196
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:22,968
That's confirmed.

197
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,512
We've swept the negotiating chamber 

198
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,479
and ground-penetrating radar.

199
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:29,224
I can assure you, it's safe.

200
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:31,344
I'm glad to hear it.

201
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:33,520
Hassan is standing by at CTU.

202
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,939
- How is he, Rob?
- He narrowly escaped

203
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,455
being blown to pieces
by his own brother...

204
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,885
So not too well.

205
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,156
But your call to him
can't just be all sympathy and concern.

206
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:46,982
We need to know
where he stands vis-a-vis the talks.

207
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,327
- It's hardly the time.
- It's exactly the time.

208
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,436
The signing is scheduled
for tomorrow.

209
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,415
Dozens of world leaders
are en route to NY.

210
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:56,001
We need to know
if we still have a peace process.

211
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,449
Put him on.

212
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:04,801
Sir,

213
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:07,042
<i>I have President Taylor for you.</i>

214
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,890
- Madam President.
- <i>I cannot begin</i>

215
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:11,573
to say how relieved I am

216
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:13,727
that you survived
this terrible attack, Omar.

217
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:14,734
Thank you.

218
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:17,949
I'm mortified that this outrage
happened on US soil.

219
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:22,142
I'm the one
who should be embarrassed.

220
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,054
My brother, Farhad, did this.

221
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,113
He betrayed me, and worse,

222
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,116
he put you in harm's way.

223
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,655
I should have realized
what he's up to.

224
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:34,002
We can only be betrayed
by the people we trust.

225
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:36,416
He fooled all of us.

226
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,711
Sir, this is Rob Weiss.

227
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:41,710
<i>You've heard Farhad escaped.</i>

228
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:43,798
<i>Can I ask what you think
his agenda might be</i>

229
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,994
aside from targeting you?

230
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,511
What I mean, sir, is...

231
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:49,846
does he have a plan?

232
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,250
Yes, he has a plan.

233
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,883
Regime change.

234
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:56,318
- Isn't that what you call it?
- Mr. President,

235
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:59,231
we're doing everything we can
to apprehend Farhad,

236
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,943
but while he's at large,

237
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:04,721
I'd understand it
if you wished not to continue the talks.

238
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:05,846
However,

239
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,077
I hope that I can
persuade you to reconvene.

240
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,965
We have come so far together.

241
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:16,628
- And to let this moment slip...
- Would be to hand Farhad victory.

242
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,251
I'll not give him this satisfaction.

243
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:23,111
If you are willing to continue
with these talks,

244
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:24,339
so am I.

245
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,134
I am delighted to hear it.

246
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,137
<i>If you could persuade</i>

247
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,390
Mr. Hastings here to release me.

248
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,934
We'll coordinate with CTU
so that you can return

249
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,435
to the UN as soon as possible.

250
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,129
<i>I know that you want to be
with your family.</i>

251
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:42,482
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam President.

252
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:52,909
- You want your office back.
- It's fine, sir.

253
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,287
Can I ask
what you and President Taylor agreed?

254
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:57,706
That I should return to UN
as soon as possible.

255
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,279
We'll make the arrangements.

256
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:02,210
Before I leave, I would like to thank
the man who saved my life.

257
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,797
That would be Agent Ortiz.
He's returning to CTU.

258
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:21,123
You should go to Medical.

259
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:22,981
Soon as I hand
the body over to forensics.

260
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,234
- What are you going to do?
- Finish my debrief and go to LA.

261
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,902
Thanks. It's been an honor.

262
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,111
Take care of yourself, okay?

263
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:35,368
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Thanks. Me, too.

264
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,899
We ID'd the assassin
using your video footage.

265
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:40,870
We think he was working
for Russian mob here.

266
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,019
- Any idea which one?
- Not yet.

267
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:45,262
But we're bringing in
someone to brief us.

268
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,212
Good.

269
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,492
It's Renee.

270
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,301
What?

271
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:52,437
Why?

272
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:55,005
Six years ago, she worked
undercover with the Russian mob.

273
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,474
FBI says she's still one
of the best experts they have.

274
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,692
- Have you spoken to her?
- No.

275
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,813
I tried phoning her,
she never returned my calls.

276
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:07,484
She made it clear she didn't want
to speak to me, so I let it go.

277
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,402
I heard she had a rough time.

278
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,454
Like, a really rough time,
some sort of a breakdown.

279
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,158
She should be landing any minute.

280
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,773
She didn't want to talk to me then,
she's not gonna do now,

281
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:19,269
I want to respect that.

282
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,656
So, please,
don't tell her I'm here, okay?

283
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:23,184
- You sure?
- Yeah.

284
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,358
I'll be waiting for you
up in Debrief One.

285
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,615
We'll get you a set of photos
as soon as possible.

286
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
Thanks.

287
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,273
- Agent Ortiz.
- Mr. President.

288
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,146
Thank you for saving my life.

289
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,362
You're welcome, sir,
but it wasn't just me.

290
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,442
If it weren't for Jack Bauer
and Chloe O'Brian,

291
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,778
- I wouldn't have succeed.
- I'll thank them, too

292
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,697
but you risked your life for me.

293
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:56,088
You put yourself
between me and the bomb.

294
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,693
My family and I are in your debt.

295
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:00,912
What's that?

296
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:02,956
It's a hazardous materials alert.

297
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,913
- Hazardous materials?
- Please wait here, sir.

298
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,592
- What's going on?
- The body triggered a hazmat alarm.

299
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,427
- We've radioactive contaminants.
- What sort of contaminants?

300
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,721
Rad count's low,
it could be uranium.

301
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,472
It's just trace elements.
No danger.

302
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,144
U-235?

303
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:27,021
- It's highly enriched uranium.
- It's weapons-grade?

304
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,733
How did he come into contact
with that?

305
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:32,444
I don't know, but he had
to have been exposed to it recently.

306
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:35,136
- I think I know the answer.
- What is it, sir?

307
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,368
We're talking about nuclear materials.
If you know something, tell us.

308
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,329
I need to talk
to Mr. Hastings right now.

309
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,433
It's good to see you.

310
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:30,508
This way.

311
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:53,316
Didn't know you were back at CTU.

312
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,029
Yeah.
Morris lost his job a year ago.

313
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,530
I asked to be reinstated,
and they assigned me here.

314
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:16,076
What about you? I heard
you've been working for a security firm.

315
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,174
I was.

316
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,477
Didn't work out.

317
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,484
So it's confirmed
and you're certain.

318
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:31,900
Thanks.

319
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,767
It's Forensics.

320
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:37,846
They confirmed the composition
of the radioactive material.

321
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,194
It's U-235,

322
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,367
94.7% pure, weapons-grade uranium.

323
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,284
If you have an explanation,

324
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:45,743
I'm eager to hear it.

325
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,247
Before we started
this peace initiative,

326
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,843
my country was close
to developing a nuclear weapon.

327
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,085
Yes, our intelligence
was aware of that.

328
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,504
We could not enrich
enough fissile material to arm it.

329
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,622
Soon after our countries began
to negotiate the peace process,

330
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,429
my brother tell me
that someone had approached him

331
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,339
with weapons-grade uranium.

332
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,531
- Who?
- Someone who had access

333
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,810
to decommissioned Soviet stockpiles.

334
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,466
You think it's the same Russians
who were trying to kill you today?

335
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,591
Yes, I do.

336
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,568
I told my brother
to stay away from them

337
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,373
but obviously he had other plans.

338
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,655
Mr. President,

339
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,887
the nuclear material
that you were offered,

340
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:26,697
you have any idea where it is?

341
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:30,413
That man was contaminated recently.
Doesn't that mean the materials are here

342
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,581
in the US?

343
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:35,654
Farhad always used to tell me

344
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:38,922
that our country will always be
at the mercy of the West

345
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:41,257
unless we become a nuclear power.

346
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,968
You must find the Russians

347
00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:46,721
before they can get
the uranium to my brother.

348
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,473
We'll do what we have to do, sir.

349
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,226
I'll notify my security forces
to cooperate fully.

350
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,357
Patty,

351
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,360
get me the file on Renee Walker's
undercover operation.

352
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,662
The stars mean
they were part of the criminal elite.

353
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:03,909
Vory v zakone.

354
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:07,092
This one spent time
in a Siberian prison camp IK-10.

355
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:09,118
The number of spires
means length of sentence.

356
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:11,204
- Three years?
- Three life terms.

357
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,455
Must have escaped.

358
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:15,792
Now these, broken cross,
here, here and here.

359
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,360
Same on all three.

360
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,260
So what does it mean?

361
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,674
Brian Hastings, director of CTU.

362
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,509
I appreciate that you came in.

363
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:27,679
- So what does it mean?
- It means "You can break our arms,

364
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,098
"and every bone in our body,
we'll never talk."

365
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:33,184
Supposed to be the symbol
for a group called Red Square.

366
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,282
Supposed to be?

367
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:37,647
We tried to find them but in vain.
The rumors say that they're ex-military,

368
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,482
special forces,
intelligence, whatever.

369
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,453
- I'm not sure they actually exist.
- They exist, Ms. Walker.

370
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:44,153
And we need to find them.

371
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:45,196
Why?

372
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,565
You're aware of the attack
in midtown today?

373
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,576
The smoking crater by the UN?
Yeah, it was hard to miss.

374
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,328
We believe it's just the beginning,

375
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,790
and that the responsibles
possess a unsecured nuclear materials.

376
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,877
Now Dana asked you here today
to brief on background.

377
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,130
But I have a much bigger ask.

378
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:07,010
You were undercover for nearly 2 years
with the Russian mob.

379
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,249
Your cover's still intact.

380
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:17,186
What are you saying exactly?
Are you asking me to go back in?

381
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,065
Would you give us a moment, please?

382
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:31,993
I wouldn't be asking
if it weren't important, but yes,

383
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:33,786
I want you to go back in.

384
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,122
This doesn't seem
in the least bit...

385
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,999
I don't know, ironic to you?

386
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:41,378
I know that you left

387
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,650
the FBI
under difficult circumstances.

388
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:45,631
Difficult doesn't even begin
to describe it.

389
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,467
I can get you your badge back.

390
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,303
I laid down my badge, Mr. Hastings.

391
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,513
I took it from my pocket
and I laid it down.

392
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,932
So why would you possibly think
that I want it back?

393
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:57,810
What do you want?

394
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,552
What do I want?

395
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:02,289
Nothing.

396
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:09,447
You have weapons-grade uranium
in the hands of the Russian O.C.

397
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:11,032
I can do something.

398
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:13,245
So I'll go back in...

399
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:15,784
but not for a badge.

400
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:20,124
Thank you.

401
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,462
We brief in ten minutes.

402
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:43,460
- Just want to say good-bye.
- You're off finally?

403
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,818
How did Renee's debriefing go?

404
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,946
- Fine until Hastings kicked me out.
- Why'd he kick you out?

405
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,406
It just started to get
really uncomfortable.

406
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:54,742
Is that her file?

407
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:57,246
I'm just trying to get up to speed.

408
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,363
They found traces of uranium
on the assassin.

409
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,500
Hastings says
there's nuclear materials in play.

410
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,293
What's that got to do with Renee?

411
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,838
He asked her to go back under
with the Russians.

412
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:14,303
What is it?

413
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,201
- Chloe didn't tell me you were here.
- I asked her not to.

414
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,495
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

415
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,150
Right.

416
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,399
You tried to get in touch,
and I didn't call back.

417
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:45,251
Sorry.

418
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,248
I was so happy to hear
that you were okay, though.

419
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,214
Thank you.

420
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:53,025
I'm surprised
that you're back at CTU.

421
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,260
I'm not.

422
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:58,055
I'm moving back to LA with my daughter.
I'm supposed to be with her right now.

423
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:00,433
Then what are you doing?

424
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:03,644
An old informant knocked on my door.
Everything went downhill from there.

425
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,063
The attack in midtown.
That's why I'm here, too.

426
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:09,108
I heard Hastings wants you
to go undercover with the Russians.

427
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:11,652
He does. I've agreed.

428
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:14,322
You think that's a good idea?

429
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:15,649
They need me.

430
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:17,585
I'm not worried about them.

431
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:20,801
I'm worried about you.

432
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,025
I know what you did.

433
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:26,032
Really?

434
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:27,919
What did I do?

435
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:30,815
You almost killed Wilson
during your interrogation.

436
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,716
It was so bad,
the FBI had to let you go.

437
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:36,344
Even after
everything you did that day.

438
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,109
I know where you are,

439
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:41,078
and it's a dark place.

440
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:43,809
- And I've come back.
- It takes longer than you think.

441
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,313
I wouldn't have signed up for this
if I wasn't ready.

442
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,772
I don't think you are.

443
00:26:57,855 --> 00:26:59,528
Renee, this is too important.

444
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:02,036
You need to let them take care of it.
They will.

445
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:07,872
I appreciate
what you're trying to do, really.

446
00:27:08,882 --> 00:27:10,670
You said you were to be
with your daughter.

447
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,880
- Please don't do this.
- Go to California.

448
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:16,550
I have a briefing.

449
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:33,926
You will receive an official apology
for your detention here,

450
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,905
but in the meantime I hope you can
accept my sincere personal regrets.

451
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,802
I'm sure you understand that
given the threat to President Hassan,

452
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,799
we were under extreme pressure.

453
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:44,030
I would have thought
that came with the job.

454
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:46,012
Along with the ability to handle it.

455
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,192
Good-bye, Mr. Hastings.

456
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:50,876
Ms. Reed.

457
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,926
Thank God you're all right.

458
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:01,313
I was lucky.

459
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:05,599
I heard it was Farhad
who tried to have you killed.

460
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:08,793
I can't believe he would betray you.

461
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:10,771
He betrayed both of us, Meredith.

462
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:12,227
And then...

463
00:28:12,683 --> 00:28:13,816
I betrayed you.

464
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:16,402
What are you talking about?

465
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,118
I told them about us.

466
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:21,351
I was scared. I panicked.

467
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:25,995
- I hope you can forgive me.
- There's nothing to forgive.

468
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:27,935
But you stood by me.

469
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:29,928
You didn't deny me.

470
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:32,142
Even though
you had a million reasons to.

471
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:34,473
Before that moment...

472
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:37,396
I never really knew...

473
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:38,883
what you felt for me.

474
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:40,765
You should have.

475
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,554
Didn't I make it clear?

476
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:51,228
What? What is it?

477
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:54,205
I nearly died today.

478
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,062
And I saw...

479
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,712
how fragile it all is.

480
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:01,804
Not only my life,

481
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:04,158
but everything I've ever worked for.

482
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,993
Any good I might be able to do.

483
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:10,228
I just can't jeopardize that.

484
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:14,746
I understand.

485
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,004
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:19,722
Don't be.

487
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,180


488
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,716
6 years ago I was undercover with them.
They were running an arms trafficking.

489
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,177
We arrested everyone
except for the man in charge,

490
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:08,097
Vladimir Laitanan. He's our target.

491
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,266
It was through him
I heard about Red Square.

492
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,336
If anyone can connect us to them
it's him.

493
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,062
All I've read about him
says he disappeared without a trace.

494
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,810
- How are you going to find him?
- Through this guy.

495
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:21,570
Ziya Dakhilov. He's out on parole.
He'll take us to Vladimir.

496
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,989
The FBI offered Ziya full immunity
if he gave up Vladimir.

497
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,741
He turned it down,
kept his mouth shut and did his time.

498
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,743
I'm not FBI,
I'm a former felon, remember?

499
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:33,164
I'll offer him the deal of a lifetime.
Trust me, he'll take it.

500
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,124
Once I contact Vladimir,

501
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,085
I'll tell him I've heard whispers
of nuclear materials on the market.

502
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,754
- I'll say I have a buyer for them.
- Who? Agent Ortiz?

503
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,174
- You up for this?
- Yes, sir.

504
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,628
- How much money are we talking about?
- For nuclear rods,

505
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:47,949
we need offshore accounts
of $100 million at least.

506
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:50,411
- Probably twice that.
- Okay, I'll get on that.

507
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,601
Chloe will work up a story to cover
the time after your release from prison.

508
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,436
Now you and Agent Ortiz

509
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,230
need to figure out where you met,
how long you've known each other.

510
00:30:59,073 --> 00:30:59,982


511
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,700
I thought you'd left.

512
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,020
Sorry to interrupt.

513
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,569
But could I have the room
with Mr. Hastings alone, please?

514
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:14,361
- You, too, Renee.
- I think I'll stay.

515
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,270
What's going on?

516
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:20,377
She hasn't been undercover
for over 6 years.

517
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,784
I think you're making a mistake
by putting her in.

518
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,343
- Tell him what's really on your mind.
- I'll tell him what I told you.

519
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,970
I'm concerned about her,
and this operation.

520
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,891
- What does that mean?
- She's not ready for this.

521
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,185
- You must have other options.
- Mr. Hastings.

522
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,528
No one else knows these Russians.
No one else can get you as close.

523
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:41,315
Unfortunately, I'm your only choice.

524
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:45,137
I appreciate your concern,
but she's right.

525
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:46,862
She's our only way in.

526
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,910
Fine, then I want to go with her.
I assume your plan

527
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,496
is trying to set up a competing buy?
I'll act as a buyer.

528
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,541
- Agent Ortiz has already agreed.
- He doesn't have the experience.

529
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,293
- This is how he gets it.
- Not with nuclear weapons on the line.

530
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,923
I'm requesting
that you send me in with Agent Walker.

531
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:10,010
If you're willing to do this,
I'd be foolish to object.

532
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,598
We'll work up a cover for you
and dovetail it with her alias.

533
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,975
We must work fast.

534
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:19,061
They're going to want to unload
the nuclear rods as quickly as possible.

535
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,527
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,310
Are you sure
this information is reliable?

537
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:39,471
- <i>It checks out.</i>
- All right then.

538
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:43,002
- Farhad is here.
- Bring him in.

539
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,865
You look worried.

540
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,219
Every cop in the country is hunting him,
but we let him come here?

541
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:53,924


542
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,948
How does looking like a scared girl
help us?

543
00:32:58,113 --> 00:32:59,518
This man is our buyer.

544
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:01,478
We found him,

545
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:03,584
we can find another.

546
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,608
My son,

547
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:08,736
we are on the verge
of the biggest deal of our lives.

548
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,179
Farhad is paying us
more than anyone dreamed possible,

549
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:13,574
you want to send him away
because he makes you nervous?

550
00:33:26,096 --> 00:33:27,446
Sit down, please.

551
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:30,633
- A drink first, then some food.
- I want to see the rods.

552
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:35,121
They will be on the same ship
that will transport you to your country.

553
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:38,450
As soon as we have completed
our financial arrangements.

554
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:40,369
You'll be paid, Bazhaev,

555
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:42,084
after I have the rods.

556
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:43,729
They are in a secure place.

557
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:46,273
- Show me.
- You've seen the photographs.

558
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,068
That's not good enough.
I want proof that the rods exist

559
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,028
or you will not be paid.

560
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:54,823
You want proof?

561
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:56,950
Okay. Come with me.

562
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:15,287


563
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,110
My younger son.

564
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,487
He was transporting the rods...

565
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:37,116
and he was careless.

566
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:41,870
There. You have your proof.

567
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:49,276
How long will it take
to get them to the ship?

568
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,212
5 hours.

569
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,673
I want to be there
to supervise the loading.

570
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,791
Whatever you want, my friend.

571
00:34:57,923 --> 00:34:59,722
Now where is my money?

572
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,885
I'll make the call.

573
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,080
Agent Walker worked undercover
as Renee Zadan

574
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,791
for 16 months before the bust went down
and she was incarcerated.

575
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,570
We're focusing on the period of time
just after her release

576
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,992
when she's supposed
to be in Mexico working with Jack.

577
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:35,637
We're synchronizing two years
of travel materials

578
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,892
mostly to and from Mexico City.

579
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:40,866
What all do we know
about this Ziya that she's visiting?

580
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:41,930
Not much.

581
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,559
He pled out to a class-three felony
one month after the bust.

582
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:47,134
He's in Long Island City

583
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:49,730
working in a store
as a condition to his release.

584
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,926
That's where Jack and Renee
are headed now.

585
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,843
- Where exactly are they?
- <i>En route</i>. Just leaving Manhattan.

586
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:57,070
Chloe,
download the cover materials to them.

587
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,761
Walk them through it.
Make sure there's no surprises.

588
00:36:07,155 --> 00:36:08,505
Jack, it's Chloe.

589
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,771
You should be receiving
a consolidated timeline

590
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,093
<i>plus detail files
for travel and residency.</i>

591
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:16,403
- <i>Have they downloaded to your PDA yet?</i>
- We got it, Chloe.

592
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:19,467
Dana would like for me to review
the facts with you, if that's okay.

593
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:22,093
We're fine, Chloe.
I know how to prep a cover.

594
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,176
- I'm sure, it's just...
- It's all right.

595
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:25,724
We'll get back to you.

596
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:29,068
I guess I will leave you then.
Good luck.

597
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,396
Thanks.

598
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:32,762
You got a problem?

599
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:35,150
You've got everyone treating me
like I'm an invalid.

600
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,029
You're not an invalid. It's procedure.
They're trying to sync up two stories.

601
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,404
He won't quiz me on the facts.
He'll decide if I'm lying.

602
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:45,285
I know. And whatever happens
after that, we need to be ready.

603
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:51,047
It's hard being with you when
you don't think that I'm up to this.

604
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:54,002
I never said you weren't up to this.

605
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:56,773
I said I was concerned about you.
It's different.

606
00:36:56,898 --> 00:37:00,217
Whatever you call it, the fact is
you don't trust me, not really.

607
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:04,322
So here we are.

608
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:07,634
Me and my babysitter.

609
00:37:17,678 --> 00:37:18,871
How are we on aerial?

610
00:37:18,996 --> 00:37:20,988
Already in place
and they're not there yet.

611
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:23,115
Jack and Renee
are 2 minutes from target.

612
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,158
They should arrive
before he closes up.

613
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:32,314
<i>Someday, you're going to have to tell me
how you picked that name.</i>

614
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,500
I can't talk now.

615
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:36,169
I like your apartment, Jenny.
Real homey.

616
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,092
And I gotta compliment you
on your skills, everything...

617
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:40,424
is in its place.

618
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:44,065
And I've been admiring your photos,

619
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:45,939
I hope you don't mind.

620
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,214
And I've noticed kind of a theme.

621
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,434
You and your boyfriend,
I'm guessing.

622
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,890
Is that right?

623
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,875
I hope it's not too serious.

624
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,952
We're getting married, Kevin.

625
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,289
<i>Who would have guessed?</i>

626
00:38:00,717 --> 00:38:03,488
<i>When I saw you, you weren't
exactly wearing an engagement ring.</i>

627
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:04,990
So tell me about him.

628
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:06,241
Kevin, don't.

629
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,409
Don't what?

630
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:09,803
I'm curious, can you blame me?

631
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:13,498
He's just a guy that I met.

632
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:16,418
A guy you met.
What's that mean, a guy you met?

633
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,242
I spent seven years in prison with guys.
Is that the kind of guy you mean?

634
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,760
We need to talk about this
in person.

635
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:28,472
I'm in the middle of a crisis here.
I can't. I don't have time.

636
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,676
In my experience, when something's
important, you make time for it.

637
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:32,893
Don't you think?

638
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:36,581
Jenny, are you there?

639
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,649
- Don't call me that!
- What?

640
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:39,713
I said...

641
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:41,982
You don't tell me what to call you,

642
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:43,607
you understand that?

643
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,821
I'll call you whatever I want!
You don't tell me anything, Jenny!

644
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,410
Now get back here.

645
00:38:52,154 --> 00:38:53,154
I said...

646
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:55,959
that I will...

647
00:38:56,965 --> 00:38:58,752
as soon as I can.

648
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:01,505
Well, it better be soon.

649
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:39,710
That's him.

650
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,213
Looks like he's closing up.

651
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:47,027
We'll use these for comm so I can
hear you in case you get into trouble.

652
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:59,271
This is your last shot.
You don't have to do this.

653
00:39:59,477 --> 00:40:01,077
I know, but I want to.

654
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,389
We're closed.

655
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,331
What'd I say?

656
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:32,512
Ziya.

657
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,766
Nice outfit.
Not a lot of men can pull off a skirt.

658
00:40:36,182 --> 00:40:37,732
When did you get out?

659
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:40,062
I thought
you were serving seven-to-ten.

660
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,481
They let me out early.
Good behavior.

661
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,567
Good behavior.

662
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:46,359
With warden?

663
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:48,729
Eventually.

664
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,156
But it's like anything else,
you gotta work your way up.

665
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,437
Why you here?

666
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,498
I'm looking for Vladimir.

667
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,292
Got a business proposition
I know he'd be interested in.

668
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:04,336
What kind of business proposition?

669
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,762
Got a buyer,
something big being sold.

670
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,843
I don't know.
Vlad disappear.

671
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:14,137
Maybe.

672
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,559
But you can find him.

673
00:41:18,182 --> 00:41:19,182
Really?

674
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:20,769
Why I do that?

675
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,431
Why do you think?

676
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:24,556
I don't know.

677
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:27,043
I'll cut you in.

678
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,404
Unless you're making so much money here
that's of no interest to you.

679
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:35,747
See? Your greedy little eyes
are saying "Show me the money",

680
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:37,772
so what's the problem, Ziya?

681
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,730
Parole bracelet?

682
00:41:44,057 --> 00:41:45,857
They know where I am 24-7.

683
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:47,796
I'm like dog.

684
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:49,792
I leave yard, I get shock.

685
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:52,008
Then help me out.

686
00:41:52,295 --> 00:41:53,366
Make some calls.

687
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:54,833
Make calls?

688
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,699
You know what happen
I make call asking where's Vladimir?

689
00:41:58,055 --> 00:42:00,319
Tomorrow,
have accident on way for work.

690
00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:04,995
Sensitive information,
done face-to-face, you know that.

691
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:06,481
You're lucky.

692
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:09,973
You get out.
Me, I'm still in prison.

693
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,029
Let me see the bracelet.

694
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,157
Come on.
Let me see it, Ziya.

695
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:17,816
What?

696
00:42:17,941 --> 00:42:19,494
Have I ever messed you up ever?

697
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,241
Come on.

698
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:25,208
Let's see.

699
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:41,156
I can get this off, guaranteed.

700
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,686
You screw, you know what happen?

701
00:42:44,975 --> 00:42:46,680
Cops come running in.

702
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:48,385
In two hours, I'm back inside.

703
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,104
Parole violation.
What?

704
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:53,570
That won't happen, I'm telling you.
I know how to get this off.

705
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,839
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I'm constantly deal

706
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,699
with people like you, that's how.

707
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,003
I can get it off
if I can just hold it steady.

708
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:17,344
- But... you can't cut bracelet.
- I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

709
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:54,756
What have you done?
What the hell have you done?

710
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:56,383
He was trapped here.

711
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,218
And you think he'll help you now?

712
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,719
This is over.

713
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,887
This is over!

714
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,367
Maybe for you,
but I'm just getting started.

715
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:05,938
Find something
to cauterize that wound.

716
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:15,161
Damn it.
