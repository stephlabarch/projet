1
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,695
Ken Dellao, CNB.

2
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:17,864
I'm wondering if you can
confirm some information.

3
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:21,768
I'm gonna be reporting in
this evening's broadcast

4
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:23,870
that a rogue ex-federal
agent named Jack Bauer

5
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:26,673
is the prime suspect in
the murder of Ryan Burnett.

6
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:30,576
You leaked this story of Burnett's
murder and my involvement to the press.

7
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:34,380
So another one of your errors in
judgment bites you on the ass.

8
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,815
You've gone too far this time.

9
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:38,450
Renee, it's Jack.
Don't hang up the phone, please.

10
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,510
Whatever they told you,
I did not kill Burnett.

11
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,725
I sent you a photo
of the man who did.

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,727
All I want you to
do is make an ID.

13
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,363
John Quinn,
Black Ops combat vet.

14
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:48,923
He works for Starkwood.

15
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:50,191
Starkwood work with Juma?

16
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:51,763
If they did,
it wasn't on the books.

17
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,833
You know, if anyone knows,
it's Senator Mayer.

18
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:57,031
Renee, where's Bauer?

19
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't know.
Don't you lie to me.

20
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:01,300
We know you accessed a
classified government database

21
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,443
and sent someone's name
and address to Bauer.

22
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:04,543
Tell me where he is.

23
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:05,711
I can't.

24
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:06,912
Put her in holding.

25
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:08,911
Mirandize her.

26
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,951
If Bauer connects us to Juma, it
could seriously impede this operation.

27
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,953
Yes, it could.

28
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:15,950
Is the shipment on time?

29
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,851
Yes. Due into port
in the next hour.

30
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:22,222
Once the weapons are deployed,
then it doesn't matter what Mr. Bauer

31
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,731
or anyone else knows.

32
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:25,390
I didn't kill Burnett.

33
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:26,433
This man did.

34
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:27,763
His name is John Quinn.

35
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:29,733
He works for Starkwood.

36
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,931
And what does Starkwood
have to do with this?

37
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,991
Your informant claims
that Starkwood was trying

38
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,571
to acquire a bioweapon,
and that's your connection to Juma.

39
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:39,471
You've been trying to dismantle
Starkwood for the last six months.

40
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:42,711
If they have a weapon like this, you
better believe they intend to use it.

41
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:45,850
No!

42
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:50,983
Just tell me where the
weapons are coming in.

43
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:53,151
You're too late.

44
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:55,693
They're already here.

45
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,830
(sighs) Sir?

46
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,601
Preliminary sweep of the
immediate area's done.

47
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:40,600
There's no sign of Bauer.

48
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:41,823
All right, widen the grid.

49
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,241
And run down security cameras
around the perimeter, witnesses.

50
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:46,142
Somebody must have seen him.

51
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:48,583
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,160
Yes?

53
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:05,962
Mr. Kanin, it's Larry Moss.

54
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:10,270
Agent Moss, please tell me you
have Jack Bauer in custody.

55
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:14,273
I wish that were the case, Mr.
Kanin, but the truth is...

56
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:18,770
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

57
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,540
He's dead.

58
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,411
What?!

59
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,013
He was murdered at his house.

60
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:27,032
We only found out that Bauer was on
his way over here a short time ago.

61
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,650
Unfortunately, we
got here too late.

62
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:29,722
Wait a minute.

63
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:35,160
Are you telling me that Jack Bauer
just killed a United States Senator?

64
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,661
That's the assumption that
we're working under, yes, sir.

65
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,202
How could you have
let this happen?!

66
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:44,303
He had us all fooled, sir.

67
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:46,872
I released Jack Bauer
into your custody!

68
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:49,542
I ordered you to keep
him on a short leash!

69
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,411
No, no. Mr. Kanin, you are not
gonna lay this one at my feet.

70
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,912
It was your decision to give
Bauer access to Burnett.

71
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:57,383
I advised you against it.

72
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:01,423
Mr. Kanin?

73
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:09,021
I'm sorry.
Uh, what did you say?

74
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:13,392
I said,
I advised you against it.

75
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:16,332
Yes, you did.

76
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,942
Sir, I have teams
sweeping the area.

77
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,100
Just find him, Agent Moss.

78
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:24,240
Yeah, I will.

79
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,762
Starkwood was involved with
everything that happened today.

80
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,663
They were the ones that
helped Juma and his men

81
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,401
bring down those planes
and attack the White House.

82
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:55,472
In exchange, they were allowed to
develop and manufacture a WMD
in Sangala.

83
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:56,673
It's a bioweapon.

84
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,543
Apparently, it's
already here in the US.

85
00:04:58,717 --> 00:04:59,843
Who else knows about this?

86
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:02,841
No one. Senator Mayer and I were
piecing together the information

87
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:04,252
right before he was killed.

88
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:05,851
You said the weapon's
already here.

89
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:07,150
Are they in possession of it?

90
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,983
I don't think so.
The text message I got

91
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,321
off their agent's cell phone said,
"Port of Alexandria, Lot C, 10:15 p.m."

92
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:15,121
Why don't we just call the FBI
and lock the whole place down?

93
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:16,292
Because we're fugitives, Tony.

94
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:17,591
No one's going to believe us.

95
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:20,803
We need to know exactly where that
weapon is before we call anyone else in.

96
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:23,303
Tony, I need to know if
you're with me on this.

97
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:25,930
Yeah, I'm with you.

98
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,833
Okay. Meet me at the
north end of the port.

99
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,641
There's an access road right
before the main entrance.

100
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:32,271
All right, I'll be there.

101
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,353
It's over.

102
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:39,880
Dubaku and Juma are dead.

103
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:44,291
Everyone responsible for
the terrorist attacks...

104
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:47,561
responsible for Roger.

105
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:51,391
Thank God for that.

106
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:54,200
And there's...
there's something else.

107
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:57,832
Something good that's
come out of all of this.

108
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:01,642
Olivia is here at
the White House.

109
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,202
Olivia?

110
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,471
She's come home, Henry.

111
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:11,081
The crisis--
it brought us together.

112
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:15,953
I've asked her to stay on as Special
Advisor, and-and she's agreed.

113
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,052
Ally...

114
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:21,092
I can't begin to tell you
how happy that makes me.

115
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,860
Me, too.

116
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,100
Sweetheart, I know
that you're tired.

117
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:28,860
You should get some rest.

118
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:33,001
Olivia and I will come to the
hospital just as soon as we can.

119
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,042
When you can.

120
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:37,912
I'm not going anywhere.

121
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:41,181
Give Olivia my love.

122
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:43,910
Love you.

123
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:46,111
We love you, too.

124
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,493
The doctors expect him
to make a full recovery.

125
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:01,001
Henry's a lot tougher
than anyone thought.

126
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:07,140
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe, just maybe,
this day will end on a positive note.

127
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,381
What is it, Ethan?
What's wrong?

128
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:24,493
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Madam President, but Senator Mayer
is dead.

129
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,952
What happened?

130
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:32,660
All evidence points to the fact
that he was murdered by Jack Bauer.

131
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,731
Bauer?

132
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:37,071
It's hard to believe, I know.

133
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:38,933
It-It doesn't make any sense.

134
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:41,942
After everything
he has done today,

135
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,842
why on earth would he do this?

136
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:48,740
We'll know more
when we find him.

137
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,841
My God.

138
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:57,553
Madam President,
in light of what's happened,

139
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,252
and for the sake of
your administration,

140
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:03,321
I'm afraid I have no choice but
to resign as your Chief of Staff.

141
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:04,491
Ethan!

142
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:09,262
Madam President, please,
you need to hear this.

143
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:15,340
Inevitably, it'll come to light that I
sanctioned Bauer's release from custody.

144
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:21,015
Unless I step down immediately, the
damage to your office, and
you personally,

145
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:25,357
will be extensive.

146
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,623
Ethan, Olivia has already
killed this story once today.

147
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,190
We can control the damage.

148
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,391
No.

149
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,991
No, not even Olivia
can control it now.

150
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,992
Not after the senator's murder.

151
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:49,003
The truth is, Madam President,
I didn't do enough to protect you.

152
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:51,611
The truth is, I failed you.

153
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:55,283
And I should shoulder the
blame for what's happened.

154
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:57,852
Ethan, really, you're...

155
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:59,252
you're taking this too far.

156
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,252
Am I?

157
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:04,321
I'm not so sure.

158
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:09,563
As your daughter has made abundantly
clear, I have a lot to answer for.

159
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:14,261
You have done nothing but be
an invaluable advisor to me

160
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:15,730
and an even better friend.

161
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:21,572
I appreciate you saying that,
Madam President, but Olivia's right.

162
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:24,512
The political
knives will be out.

163
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,482
Every decision I've made
will be scrutinized.

164
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:31,712
There will be calls for
a special prosecutor.

165
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:38,050
You're a great woman, Allison.

166
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,890
You have great work yet to do.

167
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:47,261
I'm a liability to you now.

168
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:51,431
Don't let me compromise your
next three years in office.

169
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:55,303
Don't let me sink your agenda.

170
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,773
<i>Our agenda, Ethan.</i>

171
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:04,012
Yes.

172
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:06,213
Our agenda.

173
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:15,723
Trust me, Madam President,
it's the right thing to do.

174
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:19,790
Accept my resignation.

175
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:34,743
I'll have a letter on
your desk in the morning.

176
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:52,761
They're gonna be
here any minute.

177
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,600
We need to narrow
down the search.

178
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:58,003
If they offloaded it today,
it should still be on the storage dock.

179
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:00,132
That's still a needle
in a haystack, Jack.

180
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,972
There must be over a thousand
containers in there.

181
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:05,043
We need to access
the yard's manifest.

182
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:06,542
What's the security?

183
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:09,042
I've spotted one Port Authority officer.
That's it?

184
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:10,782
That's it.

185
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,213
There's got to be more.

186
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,711
Come on, let's go.

187
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,383
Honey, it'll be fine.

188
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:18,123
I get relieved in a few hours.

189
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,550
Carl, you know I don't like
you working double shifts.

190
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,291
Well, it was my choice.

191
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:23,821
And we could use the overtime.

192
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:24,962
How are the girls?

193
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,890
Kicking like a
chorus line tonight.

194
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:28,761
They miss their daddy.

195
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,132
What'd the doctor say?

196
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:31,973
That I'm lucky
it's not triplets.

197
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,571
Honey, let me call you back.

198
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,203
Don't even think about
going for your weapon.

199
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:16,742
I need the port's manifest.
Where is it?

200
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,382
I'm just a PA cop.

201
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:19,952
Where is it?

202
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:22,121
Customs House.

203
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,492
That way.

204
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:25,993
Let's go.

205
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:38,203
We on schedule?

206
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,193
STOKES (on phone):
We're at the staging area

207
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:42,191
near the port, sir,
but we're still waiting on Quinn.

208
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,630
He should have
been there by now.

209
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:44,762
Have you heard from him?

210
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:46,862
We've tried his cell,
but he's not answering.

211
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:52,473
If Bauer took out Quinn, he might
have knowledge of the operation.

212
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,070
Mightn't he?

213
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:56,242
Should we stand down, sir?

214
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:01,981
No. Give Quinn five more minutes,
then go in.

215
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:06,423
Do so with extreme caution
then contact me the minute

216
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,993
that you've secured
the container.

217
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:09,420
Yes, sir.

218
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,923
SEATON: Everybody on
the board is here, sir.

219
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,062
You have a worried look, Greg.

220
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,263
It's very tense in there, sir.

221
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,433
They're six-year-olds, Greg.

222
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,432
And they need to
eat their carrots.

223
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,940
It's been a rough day for
the United States of America.

224
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:38,523
The White House under siege,
the President taken hostage...

225
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:41,222
It's especially painful because
we know this didn't have to be.

226
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:46,792
Fact: the United States military
is strained to the breaking point.

227
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:52,862
Fact: reinstatement of the draft is
off the table for political reasons.

228
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:55,901
Fact: the people in this room,
you all control

229
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,301
the largest private army
in the Western hemisphere.

230
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:01,510
Now, could we have
been of help today?

231
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,712
You bet your ass we
could've been of help!

232
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,380
But they didn't call us,
did they?

233
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:10,380
No. Instead, we sit here,
our contracts are canceled,

234
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,380
our soldiers vilified,
our corporate sovereignty

235
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,550
is threatened by
congressional fiat.

236
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:17,962
Doug, you brokered the
deal with this government.

237
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,363
You were short-sighted and they
don't understand that the global war

238
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:24,600
on terror can only be
won by forces like ours.

239
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,201
So as of this minute,
we sit for no more depositions.

240
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:29,702
We volunteer no more documents.

241
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,803
I don't even want us to take any phone
calls. Is that what this is about?

242
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:35,372
With the security of our country,
Is that what this is about?

243
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:37,070
we cannot afford to
let them take us down.

244
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,510
Is that what this
is about then?

245
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:44,051
You came here to ask the board
to risk a federal indictment?

246
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:45,853
It won't work, Jonas.

247
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:47,520
We got a deal.

248
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,522
It's a good deal and
we're lucky to have it.

249
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,923
With an administration
that wants to destroy us.

250
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:54,460
Wants to take us
out of business.

251
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,532
No, it's all different now.

252
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,701
Today was a game-changer.

253
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,932
No, institutionally,
we are in compliance with the subpoena.

254
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,400
Documents have been filed,
depositions taken.

255
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:05,571
Not anymore.

256
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:10,112
Jonas, we have to stay engaged with this
administration. No, we don't, Doug.

257
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,142
So look,
you and I can talk this out.

258
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:15,282
If you guys have any questions,
any further questions, Greg, you will

259
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,903
stick around and
you'll answer them.

260
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,182
Thank you for coming everyone.

261
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,580
Thank you.

262
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,992
Your way was a mistake, Doug.

263
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:30,701
You have to acknowledge that.

264
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:34,600
Maybe. But you and I both know
that Starkwood cannot survive

265
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:36,731
an all-out war against
the subcommittee.

266
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,103
Let me worry about that.

267
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,313
No, you should worry
about Senator Mayer.

268
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:43,210
He's not going to
let go of this.

269
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,712
He's got his teeth in it.

270
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,853
Senator Mayer's dead.

271
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:54,222
He was killed by a rogue federal
agent not one hour ago, tragically.

272
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:59,520
Jonas.

273
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,100
Tell me you had nothing
to do with this.

274
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:13,600
Are you accusing me of complicity
in the murder of Senator Mayer?

275
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,212
I want a personal assurance.

276
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:22,582
Starkwood is not in the business
of political assassination, Doug.

277
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:25,920
Though maybe we
should look into it.

278
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,093
I hear it's a growth market.

279
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:42,772
Jack, you finding anything?
12 ships were unloaded here today.

280
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:46,773
Any from Sangala? There's no deepwater
port in that area of West Africa.

281
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:48,443
If the weapon
originated from there,

282
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,883
it would've had to overland
into Pointe-Noire.

283
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,041
Where...

284
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:58,420
two of the 12 ships acquired cargo from
that port within the last four weeks.

285
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,421
Come on.

286
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,962
Come on. Damn it!

287
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:06,861
What is it? I can't access

288
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,190
their manifests;
their database is password protected.

289
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:15,402
What's your name, officer?

290
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:16,500
Gadsen.

291
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:17,731
Carl Gadsen.

292
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:20,172
I don't have any information
about a password.

293
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:22,270
Carl, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

294
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,641
The same terrorists who took
down two planes earlier today

295
00:17:24,748 --> 00:17:27,242
and attacked the White House are trying
to acquire a weapon of mass destruction.

296
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,080
They're coming here to
pick up that weapon.

297
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,321
It's somewhere out there in your
yard in one of those canisters.

298
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:34,223
Look, I understand
this might be hard

299
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:36,493
for you to believe.
No, actually, it's not.

300
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,092
You don't have a lot of time.

301
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,593
What do you mean?

302
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:40,890
They are coming.

303
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,933
In fact,
they should be here already.

304
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,530
Keep talking, Carl.

305
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,830
They told me they were smuggling
in electronics from South Korea.

306
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:48,870
I swear.

307
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:50,672
I had no idea they
were terrorists.

308
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,472
What'd you agree
to do for them?

309
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:54,202
Open the front gate.
Look the other way.

310
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,343
Is that it?

311
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:57,711
Disable the security cameras.

312
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:00,012
A yard this size should
have more police officers.

313
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:01,880
Where are they?
I'm the supervisor.

314
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,381
I do the shift schedules.

315
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:05,720
I made sure I'd be
the only one here.

316
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,250
That's enough
confirmation for me.

317
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:09,053
I'm making the call. Untie him.

318
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,091
Who's he calling?

319
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,790
The FBI.
Now that we're confident

320
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,291
the weapon's here,
we're calling in the authorities.

321
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:20,870
Tony? My cell is down,
so is the landline.

322
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:23,001
Someone's jamming
communications.

323
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,911
It's them.

324
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,382
They gave me that radio;
told me they'd be

325
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,470
contacting me. Answer the call.
Just play along.

326
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:41,293
Answer the call.

327
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,320
Hello?

328
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:46,322
Where are you?

329
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,330
I didn't think you were coming.

330
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:51,531
You're late.
Well, we're here now and we're waiting.

331
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,031
Okay.

332
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,401
They're at the front gate.

333
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:56,873
Put your belt back on.

334
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,302
I want you to resume your post.

335
00:18:58,476 --> 00:18:59,943
Pretend like
everything's normal.

336
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,402
Just let them in.
And then what?

337
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:03,441
We're going to follow them
as soon as they pick up

338
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:04,830
their container;
once we're past

339
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,612
the jamming grid, we'll make our call.
I don't know.

340
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,481
What do you mean
you don't know?

341
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:11,922
You're a part of this, Carl,
whether you want to be or not.

342
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,791
You became a part of it this the second
you said "yes" to these people. Jack!

343
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,752
What do you got?
I got three vehicles.

344
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:21,830
Eight hostiles, heavily armed; got to
assume there's more inside the trucks.

345
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:25,303
Carl, if you don't open that gate,
they're going

346
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,562
to come in here looking you,
you understand me?

347
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:30,731
Let me put it to you this way.

348
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:33,772
These men have killed
over 300 people today.

349
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:35,973
If they get ahold
of that weapon,

350
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,412
they're going to make that
look like child's play.

351
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,283
You've only got
one choice here.

352
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,321
I just open the gate
and let them in.

353
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,992
That's all you've got to do.

354
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,152
And you guys got my back,
right? Yeah.

355
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,321
Promise me.

356
00:19:56,835 --> 00:19:58,260
I promise you.

357
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,530
Okay.

358
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:05,240
Tony, get the
surveillance package.

359
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:06,773
Don't worry.

360
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:08,581
It's just so we can
hear what's going on.

361
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:11,710
Turn around.

362
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,942
I need to put this
on your back.

363
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:18,582
Listen, the money--
it wasn't about greed or anything.

364
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,551
It's my wife, Linda.
She's having twins.

365
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:23,391
They say it's the most natural
thing in the world, right?

366
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:24,463
Getting pregnant?

367
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,793
Well, it took us three years,
cost an arm and a leg.

368
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:32,161
No excuses,
but insurance doesn't cover a dime.

369
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:33,960
I just always wanted
to have a family.

370
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,372
You know what I mean?

371
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,533
Put this in your pocket.

372
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,342
You got him?

373
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,311
Yeah.

374
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:49,510
Remember, it's just
another day at the office.

375
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:51,852
You're going to be fine.

376
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,222
Let's go.

377
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:16,682
What took you so long, Carl?

378
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:18,221
You got the routing documents?

379
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:19,393
Sure.

380
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,890
I need to see them in order
to locate the container.

381
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,163
Relax, Carl.
They're right here.

382
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,202
Okay.

383
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:31,400
Center section.

384
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:34,743
Row 36, Q-block.

385
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:36,352
It's that fourth
stack on your left.

386
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,473
I know where the
container is, Carl.

387
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:42,712
Did you disable the
security cameras?

388
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,751
They've been off since 10:00,
just like you said.

389
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:50,052
How's your wife?

390
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,893
She's fine.

391
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,663
You didn't tell her anything about this,
did you?

392
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,863
No, of course not.

393
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:00,030
Did you tell anybody else?

394
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,633
No, no, why would I?

395
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:03,761
You tell me, Carl.

396
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,572
Why are you so nervous?

397
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:11,212
Okay, um, you want to know the truth,
Mr. Stokes?

398
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:16,210
Uh... I was expecting a simple pickup,
but you show up

399
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,582
with a small army here, and, um...
And what?

400
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:22,623
It's just...
not w-what I was expecting, that's all.

401
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:24,891
I just don't want
to get caught.

402
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:28,991
Nobody's gonna
get caught, Carl.

403
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,463
Let's go, we're moving.

404
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,660
You too, Carl, take a ride.

405
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,932
I told you,
it's the fourth stack on your left.

406
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:35,750
Q-block, row 36.

407
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,231
I'd feel better
if you showed us.

408
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:38,930
I really should stay here,
Mr. Stokes.

409
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:40,302
I got to finish my patrol.

410
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:41,373
Why, Carl?

411
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:42,742
You expecting somebody?

412
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:45,041
No. Then get in.

413
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:49,442
Okay.

414
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:56,753
Damn it.

415
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:59,223
Forget about him, Jack.

416
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:01,390
He was dead the minute he
stepped out that door.

417
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:04,331
You and I both know that.

418
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:25,183
Ethan, I just came to
say how sorry I am.

419
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:30,020
Well, I appreciate the
courtesy if not the sincerity.

420
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:36,492
As much as I may feel this is what's
best for my mother, on a personal level

421
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,892
I'm sorry you have to
go through this...

422
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:44,331
and for some of the harsher
things I said to you in anger.

423
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:48,742
Well, I suppose I owe you an apology,
too, for accusing you

424
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:53,770
of leaking my role in this
Bauer fiasco to the press.

425
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:56,583
I really believed you were
trying to blindside me.

426
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:00,330
Considering the impression I gave you,
I'm not surprised.

427
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:06,852
Olivia, as someone who's
known you most of your life,

428
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:08,861
I'd like to offer some advice.

429
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:10,990
Of course.

430
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:19,530
Ambition can be a valuable
quality here in Washington

431
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:27,073
as well as in life, but unchecked,
it can be unhealthy, if not dangerous.

432
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,581
What I'm trying to say is...

433
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:33,413
you got yourself a seat
at the president's table.

434
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:36,483
She listens to you.

435
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:41,722
But running a country is
not like running a campaign.

436
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,433
It's not about doing
whatever it takes to win.

437
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:49,032
It's about doing what's right
for the American people.

438
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:54,901
Sometimes those things
aren't mutually exclusive.

439
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,613
Well...

440
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:07,053
good-bye, Olivia.

441
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:09,222
Good-bye.

442
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,303
MAN: Hello.

443
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:24,703
It's Olivia.

444
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,300
You can go with that story now,
Ken, and it just got better.

445
00:25:27,408 --> 00:25:29,142
Tell me.

446
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:30,942
Ethan Kanin's resigning.

447
00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:31,812
What happened?

448
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:34,713
I thought the plan was to let him
twist in the wind for a while.

449
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:36,040
His hand was forced. Thank you.

450
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:39,950
It seems Jack Bauer just
murdered Senator Mayer.

451
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:41,352
(whispering): What?

452
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:43,522
You're kidding me.

453
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:44,993
Anybody else have this yet?

454
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:47,621
Not yet,
it's all yours in time for the 11:00.

455
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:49,490
Told you I'd take care of you,
didn't I?

456
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:50,962
You are too good to me, Olivia.

457
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:53,531
You just hold up your end.

458
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,531
Make sure Kanin's the fall guy.

459
00:25:55,706 --> 00:25:57,503
My mother is nowhere
near this, understand?

460
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:58,373
No problem.

461
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:00,672
She really doesn't have any
idea that you're the leak?

462
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:02,871
No, and it'd better
stay that way.

463
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:06,743
She won't hear it from me.

464
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,211
When are we having that
dinner you promised?

465
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:12,081
Maybe next week.

466
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:13,352
It's always next week.

467
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:16,350
You'd better get to work if you're
going to make that broadcast.

468
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:37,851
So these files on the computer--
presumably Senator Mayer was looking

469
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:39,183
at 'em before he was killed?

470
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:40,080
Someone was, sir.

471
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:42,623
They were opened and viewed
within the last hour.

472
00:26:42,797 --> 00:26:44,923
So if the sen...

473
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:48,463
if the senator was
killed point-blank

474
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:50,690
in the entry hall,
how are we explaining the slugs

475
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:52,632
in the door frame
and the railing?

476
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:53,802
I don't know, sir.

477
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:55,702
Get the crime lab guys on it.

478
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:57,872
Yes, sir.

479
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:13,280
Agent Walker,
it's Larry Moss for you.

480
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:17,050
Hello.

481
00:27:17,227 --> 00:27:18,393
Senator Mayer is dead.

482
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,093
Where's Jack?

483
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:25,461
Don't know; we don't have him.

484
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:27,640
Okay, but what,
you think that he did this, Larry?

485
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:29,030
First Burnett and now Mayer?

486
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:30,400
Well...

487
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:32,132
it looks that way.

488
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:34,170
What do you mean
"looks that way"?

489
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:36,143
Well, that's why I'm calling.
Senator Mayer

490
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:38,242
was killed with a UMP
40 submachine gun.

491
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:42,181
If Bauer was on the run, where'd he
get ahold of a weapon like that?

492
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:44,282
Also, there's evidence to
suggest that the, uh--

493
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:46,051
there was a third
party in the house

494
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:48,020
when the senator was killed.
What kind of evidence?

495
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,421
Unexplained slugs...

496
00:27:50,555 --> 00:27:53,420
...a broken set of French doors,
a chair where it doesn't belong.

497
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,722
Okay, so are you saying that
this third party killed Mayer?

498
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:58,703
Well, you know, Renee, I might be
saying that if I knew what the hell

499
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:01,800
Bauer was doing here
in the first place.

500
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:03,130
All right, Renee, listen.

501
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,192
I want to meet you halfway, I do,
but if you expect me to even entertain

502
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:08,300
Bauer's innocence,
you have got to help me here.

503
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:09,213
I can't, Larry.

504
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:12,372
If Jack is still underground,
he is underground for a reason.

505
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:14,942
There were files open
on Mayer's computer--

506
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:17,881
documents relating to his
investigation into Starkwood.

507
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,952
All right, so just tell me that,
tell me that.

508
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:23,321
Did Starkwood ever come up in
your conversation with Bauer?

509
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,992
Renee.

510
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:35,503
Look, maybe, maybe I should
have trusted you before, okay,

511
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:39,141
but you have got
to trust me now.

512
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:42,373
What role does Starkwood
play in all this?

513
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,512
The man who framed Jack

514
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:54,921
for Burnett's murder was John Quinn,
a Starkwood contractor.

515
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:58,991
Jack believes that they were behind Juma
and all of the terrorist attacks today.

516
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,360
He went to Mayer to get
the evidence to prove it.

517
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:04,760
I have to assume that
Quinn followed him there.

518
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:06,531
That's all that I know,
Larry, I swear.

519
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:09,001
Okay, I believe you.

520
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:10,100
Thank you.

521
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:12,943
Just sit tight,
I'll be in touch soon.

522
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:14,113
Well, let me help, Larry.

523
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:15,373
I mean,
Jack could still be out there.

524
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:16,373
He may be in trouble.

525
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,112
No, no, I can't release you,
not yet.

526
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:34,462
Reese, what's the status?

527
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:36,691
Just getting the chassis on,
sir, I'll be a minute.

528
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:37,761
Hurry it up.

529
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:43,103
Hold up, hold up,
I don't have my truck.

530
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:44,873
Put it down there,
I want it there.

531
00:29:59,557 --> 00:30:00,451
Mitch, get up there.

532
00:30:00,627 --> 00:30:02,182
Let's run a diagnostic now.

533
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,153
I want to be ready to roll as soon as
Reese gets here with that flatbed.

534
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:07,792
Yes, sir.

535
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:19,673
All right, there's the package.

536
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,103
We should get back to the car.

537
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:24,073
We want to be in position to follow
that container once they move out.

538
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:28,981
Jack.

539
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:31,781
Just give me one second.

540
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,082
Cooper.

541
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:35,751
Now's as good a time as
any to settle up with Carl.

542
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:37,590
COOPER: Yes, sir.

543
00:30:37,756 --> 00:30:38,691
Thanks, Carl.

544
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:41,193
Good luck.

545
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:43,333
Let's go.

546
00:30:43,495 --> 00:30:44,890
Where we going?

547
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,760
Your money's in my truck,
just one aisle over.

548
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:53,700
Jack, we should get going.

549
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:54,943
No.

550
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,310
What are you doing?

551
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,323
I thought you said the
money was in the truck.

552
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:11,821
What the hell's going on?

553
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,061
Just keep moving.

554
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:18,793
Listen, I don't know what Stokes
told you, but I didn't tell a soul.

555
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,601
Damn it, Jack,
what the hell are you doing?

556
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:25,472
Don't do it.

557
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:27,871
You're gonna turn a surveillance
job into a firefight.

558
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,211
It'll be two against ten.

559
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,610
Two against nine.

560
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:33,610
Right, and we lose our best
chance at getting this weapon.

561
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:35,240
Don't break your own rules.

562
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:37,753
You may save one man,
but what about the thousands of people

563
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:39,281
who could die in a
biological attack?

564
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:42,293
Is this about you,
Jack, or about them?

565
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:46,061
You want to prevent another disaster
or ensure that it's going to happen?

566
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,332
That's far enough.

567
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,233
Turn around.

568
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:03,242
You're going to kill me, you're
going to have to look me in the eye.

569
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:05,473
Okay.

570
00:32:07,517 --> 00:32:09,512
Damn it.

571
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:14,223
Thank you, thank you.

572
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:17,292
We've got about 30 seconds before
they figure out what happened.

573
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:18,621
Okay, what's our fallback?

574
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:20,120
Steal the truck. Strong?

575
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:22,890
I'll make the direct assault,
you cover the east flank.

576
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:25,862
All we need is a big enough firefight
to get one of us behind the wheel.

577
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:26,962
You ready? Yeah.

578
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:29,232
Go.

579
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:34,342
How do we look?

580
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,943
Diagnostics check out, sir.

581
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:39,942
The package is stable.

582
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:42,210
Good.

583
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:45,382
All right,
let's get her on the chassis!

584
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:04,433
Cooper, come on.

585
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,640
Let's roll.

586
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:08,643
Cooper, do you copy?

587
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:17,610
Dolen.

588
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,312
Check the next aisle over.

589
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:21,220
Find Cooper.

590
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:26,723
Hold your position.

591
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:28,062
Wait for my signal.

592
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:34,963
Cooper's down, Cooper's down.

593
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:36,031
Go red, go red!

594
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:37,631
Let's move out... Greer.

595
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,701
Engage... engage.

596
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:36,161
Reese, get the truck
out of here now!

597
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,333
Go, go, go!

598
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:39,430
Tony!

599
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:40,902
The truck-- I'm going after it.

600
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:42,032
Cover me now!

601
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:16,170
Two shooters--
fan out and find them.

602
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,450
??

603
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,603
Tony, this is Jack--
do you copy?

604
00:36:04,516 --> 00:36:05,712
Drop it.

605
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:11,792
Tony?

606
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,461
I know you.

607
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:17,030
You're on Emerson's crew.

608
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:19,230
You're Almeida, right?

609
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:25,503
I know Bauer's with you.

610
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:26,770
Now, where is he?

611
00:36:53,248 --> 00:36:55,003
(phone ringing) Larry Moss.

612
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:57,441
Larry, it's Jack.
Jack, where the hell have you been?

613
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:59,182
I need you to scramble
multiple teams

614
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:01,612
to a weigh station on Highway 236,
exit 29.

615
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,853
I'm in a big rig
about ten miles south.

616
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,012
What's going on?

617
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:06,951
You also need to send
a CDC recovery unit.

618
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:07,982
Why?

619
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:11,312
I'm in possession of a biological weapon
interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.

620
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,000
A biological weapon?

621
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:14,292
Larry, just listen to me.

622
00:37:14,395 --> 00:37:15,423
I don't care if you arrest me.

623
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:16,561
I don't care if you shoot me.

624
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,392
Just get your teams out here.

625
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:20,762
I fully expect to be
pursued by hostiles.

626
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,031
Starkwood?

627
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,530
How do you know
about Starkwood?

628
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:24,362
I talked to Renee.

629
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:26,233
And I saw what was
on Mayer's computer.

630
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:27,771
Larry, they're coming
after this weapon.

631
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:28,942
You can count on it.

632
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:32,170
Now, be advised, I believe that
Tony Almeida is being held hostage.

633
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:34,312
All right,
I'll call out an interagency alert.

634
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,912
We'll secure both locations.

635
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:36,911
Larry, hurry.

636
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:43,671
Damn it!

637
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,483
Sir, this is Stokes.

638
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:58,010
What's your status?

639
00:40:58,187 --> 00:40:59,981
The package is secure--
we're inbound.

640
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:01,550
What about Bauer?

641
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,552
He's at the scene, sir,
but he sought cover nearby.

642
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,121
Well, we have to assume that
he contacted the authorities,

643
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:11,230
so we better be on an
accelerated timetable.

644
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:12,460
Get over here.

645
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,001
It will be there
in ten minutes.

646
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,063
We're right behind.

647
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:16,261
Good.

648
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:21,142
I've got teams on the ground
prepping for your arrival.

649
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:27,143
Larry Moss.

650
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:28,312
Larry, it's Jack.

651
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:31,911
I'm still on Route 236, but I had
to stop approximately seven miles

652
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:33,381
before the weigh station.

653
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,402
Jack, I got two units
moving to you right now.

654
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,220
Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to redirect them.

655
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,122
Why?

656
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:39,863
Starkwood reacquired
the bioweapon.

657
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:42,663
They managed to access one of
the dock's freight helicopters.

658
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:46,161
While they had me pinned down, they
airlifted the freight right out of here.

659
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:48,660
They were headed due west
from my current position.

660
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:51,372
West... they got a large
military facility in that area.

661
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:53,332
Okay, good--
redirect the teams there.

662
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:56,342
Jack, I can't assault a private
compound unless I have proof

663
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:57,441
that a weapon exists.

664
00:41:57,547 --> 00:41:58,541
Okay, where's the CDC?

665
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:00,212
They're scrambling
a team right now.

666
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,843
Send them to me.

667
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:03,412
You'll have all
the proof you need.

668
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:04,653
Jack, what happened?

669
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:08,322
One of the canisters was breached
during the interdiction.

670
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:11,191
Some of the bio-agent
was released.

671
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:13,053
I...

672
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:14,720
I was exposed.

673
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:17,861
Okay.

674
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,363
Jack, just sit right.

675
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,863
CDC's on the way.

676
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,601
They're going to be there soon.
