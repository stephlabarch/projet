00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,812
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance,

4
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:19,096
a small chance
that I could help you.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,145
I'm dying.

6
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,023
And whatever small chance there is
to stop that from happening

7
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:26,262
it is not worth the pain

8
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:29,487
for me to let you sit
there and watch me die.

9
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:33,153
- I don't want to lose you.
- Come here.

10
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:34,784
I don't.

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,596
What is it?

12
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:39,037
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,

13
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:41,916
but you need to go.

14
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,263
Hodges was behind
everything that happened today,

15
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:46,736
from the planes going down
to the attack on the White House.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,453
He's also responsible
for the death of my brother.

17
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:53,427
All you need to know is Hodges
worked a deal. Witness Protection.

18
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,131
My mother approved it
and he's going free...

19
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,015
- unless someone intervenes.
- I'll get you

20
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,985
contact information, a price

21
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,645
and instructions
on how to transfer the funds.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,855
Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,817
I spoke to the contact,
but I couldn't go through with it.

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,026
Listen to me, Jibraan.

25
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,075
If you don't do exactly as I say,

26
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,915
you'll watch your younger brother die
in front of your eyes.

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,133
And then...

28
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,002
I'm gonna kill you.

29
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,298
The Americans killed our parents.
I'm going to make them pay.

30
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:34,427
What have you done to my brother?
This isn't my brother.

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,848
We're looking for a man who comes here.
Jibraan Al-Zarian. Do you know him?

32
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:42,560
I know him,
but he is not a terrorist.

33
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,563
We did not come here to debate
this with you! Where does he live?

34
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,774
You come into a house of worship
with information you should not have,

35
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,673
an outrageous accusation,
no legal warrant and threaten me.

36
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:54,675
I have not threatened you.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Not yet,

38
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,492
but we both know
where this is going.

39
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:02,204
<i>It's Chloe. I found something weird
about these hits on Jibraan Al-Zarian.</i>

40
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,116
You know how I said that the $2 million
was deposited over a period of 6 months?

41
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,710
They were backdated.

42
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,420
What about the extremist Web sites?

43
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,923
Same thing with the time stamps.
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.

44
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,675
<i>Jibraan could be innocent.</i>

45
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,529
What do you have, Agent?

46
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,679
Armed hostile in the back room
holding a hostage.

47
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:21,640
- What about Almeida?
- He's not in there. See for yourself.

48
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,575
- Is that who you're looking for?
- No.

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,519
It's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.

50
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,014
They're using him
to make Jibraan do what they want.

51
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,098
- How can you be sure?
- It's what I'd have done.

52
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:37,615
Hamid, stop!

53
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,450
Put it down.

54
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,077
We're FBI. We need him alive.

55
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:52,713
The canister's being retrofitted
to maximize dispersion.

56
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,990
We're on target
to release the bioweapon

57
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:56,967
at Washington Central Station
within the hour.

58
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,305
<i>Your casualty estimates
are holding up?</i>

59
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,888
I think they're conservative.

60
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,881
A significant portion of the pathogen
will escape into the ventilation system,

61
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:06,393
which will circulate it for us.

62
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:10,288
Between 8,000 and 10,000 commuters
will be exposed.

63
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,900
Tell me about Mr. Al-Zarian.
Is he compliant?

64
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,202
Yes.

65
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,862
His primary concern at this point
is for the safety of his brother.

66
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,975
All right.

67
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,032
What's his level of awareness
regarding the plan?

68
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:23,327
He won't know anything
about the canister until it's too late.

69
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,930
Good. We'll talk once it's done.

70
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:39,858
Trigger mechanism's working.

71
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:03,791
This device will tell me
where you are at all times.

72
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:07,005
It will also allow us
to talk to each other.

73
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,605
Talk about what?

74
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:11,166
You still haven't told me
what you want me to do.

75
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,336
Right now I just want you
to get on the subway

76
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,299
and take the Red Line
all the way to Washington Center.

77
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,875
And when I get there?

78
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,968
I'll let you know then.

79
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,431
I'm not stupid.

80
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:26,807
I know you're going to blame me
for something.

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,518
- Jibraan...
- What's your plan?

82
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,146
You're going to hurt people?

83
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,916
Jibraan, the only person you
need to worry about right now

84
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,285
is your brother.

85
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,812
You follow my instructions,
and Hamid lives.

86
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,415
You do something stupid,
and he dies...

87
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,510
badly.

88
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,411
Understood?

89
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:49,914
Good.

90
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,625
Red Line,

91
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
westbound,

92
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:55,280
to Washington Center, got it?

93
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,080
Let's go. Come on.

94
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,423
Sorry this had to happen like this.

95
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:25,926
We will find your brother.

96
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:34,885
You should talk to him.

97
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:39,985
Kid doesn't know anything,

98
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,102
except that his brother was taken
by Tony about a half an hour ago.

99
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:45,571
He didn't overhear anything
about a target or the time frame.

100
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,157
Right now, he's our only lead.

101
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,473
I don't know
if he's in any condition to talk.

102
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:51,598
My God!

103
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:54,642
Hold his head.
I'm going to give him some morphine.

104
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:57,041
No, you're not.

105
00:06:57,573 --> 00:06:59,728
His wound is in the middle
of a nerve cluster.

106
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,879
- He can go into shock from the pain.
- I know.

107
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:03,141
Back off.

108
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,558
You just step out of the room.

109
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,728
Do what you need to do.

110
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:21,899
Where's Almeida?

111
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,859
- Give me the morphine.
- I'll give you

112
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,403
the morphine as soon as you talk.
Where's Tony Almeida?

113
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,402
- What's the target?
- I don't know...

114
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,578
- What's the target?
- I don't know!

115
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,071
I'm telling you the truth!

116
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,442
My job was just to watch the kid
and monitor things here.

117
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,001
Almeida didn't tell me where
he was going or where the target is.

118
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:44,370
- How do you contact him?
- I can't.

119
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:47,805
Okay, okay.

120
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:50,340
I have a number.

121
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,596
But I'm not supposed to use it
unless there's a problem.

122
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,681
You better start
thinking of one fast.

123
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,235
- Where is his phone?
- I have it here.

124
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,639
Give him enough morphine

125
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:02,924
so that he can take the pain
out of his voice. Nothing more.

126
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,281
Get Chloe to run a trace
on this number.

127
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:07,194
Tell her to feed it back
to our cell phones.

128
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,542
Start thinking
about what you're gonna say.

129
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,205
You try and screw with me on this,

130
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,415
it'll be the last thing you ever do.
Understood?

131
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,598
Do you understand me?

132
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:25,723
Yes.

133
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,735
- Janis Gold.
- It's Renee.

134
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,850
I need Chloe to run a peer-to-peer
cellular trace from a GSM I.D.

135
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:32,909
I can do that.

136
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,135
<i>Jack asked for Chloe
to run point on this.</i>

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,057
What's the number?

138
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,467
- Alpha-Charlie-3316.
- Got it.

139
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,979
- Run it back through to me and Jack.
- Hold on.

140
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,481
- She's working on it.
- Good.

141
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,316
I'll open up the locate protocol.

142
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,443
You establish a secure VPN.

143
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:53,157
- Opening a channel on the Inter-Sat...
- Why would you do that?

144
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:54,843
What?

145
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,703
You know connecting through a DMA node
would be a lot faster.

146
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,290
I don't know it's quicker to use a node
or else I would have done just that.

147
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,437
I had no idea the DMA nodes
were up and running.

148
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:06,378
Really? Because they've been up
and running for about two years.

149
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:11,418
It's obvious I'll never be able
to do things as well as you did at CTU.

150
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,594
All I ask is that you not
make me feel like an idiot

151
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,305
while you're pointing that out.

152
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,140
All right.

153
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:23,520
Agent Walker, the trace is up
and running whenever you're ready.

154
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:26,297
Chloe, I'm on.

155
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,569
You ready?

156
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,821
What's the number?

157
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:34,393
202...

158
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,475
555...

159
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,869
0147.

160
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:44,928
It's ringing.

161
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:49,008
- Why are you calling me?
- I was checking Al-Zarian's computer,

162
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,215
double-checking
everything we planted.

163
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,426
The bank that we use in Switzerland
just e-mailed him,

164
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,803
rejecting one of the transfers
we made in his name.

165
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:00,891
- You know how to resubmit it?
- I'm not sure.

166
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,435
- Are you getting this?
- Tony's got something on his phone

167
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,771
encrypting his location.
I'm trying to get around it.

168
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:07,607
<i>All right.</i>

169
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,143
Call our man in Zurich.

170
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:11,693
He'll walk you through it.

171
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:15,072
All right. I just wanted to get
your authorization before I did that.

172
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,532
Any other problems?

173
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,743
<i>Good.</i>

174
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,370
Chloe, did you get that?

175
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,331
I didn't have time to decrypt the }data.
All I know right now

176
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,208
somewhere
in the Adams Morgan district.

177
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,603
<i>We're running out of time.
We have to narrow that down.</i>

178
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,338
I'm trying. I have to decrypt
the rest of the location data.

179
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,423
<i>- How long will that take?</i>
- I don't know.

180
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,510
- We've got to do better than that.
- I need to get off the phone.

181
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,174
Janis, I want you
to contact Metro P.D.

182
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:42,125
I want you to get them to move
their Hazmat teams and their Tac teams

183
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,434
over to Adams Morgan.
We're on our way now. Let's go.

184
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,172
- I need you to call the police.
- Excuse me?

185
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,539
Speak up, sir.

186
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,204
I can't do that.

187
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:20,005
- They're listening.
- Who's listening?

188
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,680
The people who have my brother.

189
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,260
The terrorists.

190
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,770
They're going to kill my brother
unless I do what they say.

191
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,732
They want me to get on this train.

192
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:34,206
- That's it? Just get on the train?
- Yes, please.

193
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:36,653
You have to help me, okay?
You have to call the police.

194
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,179
Is there a problem here, sir?

195
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:44,289
Yes, thank you, officer.
Please, I need your help.

196
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,728
Sir, just calm down
and step this way.

197
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:50,205
What is it?

198
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,462
Listen, they have my brother hostage.
Okay, you have to believe me.

199
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,256
Put the earpiece back in.

200
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,165
- What?
- I said, put the earpiece back in.

201
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:02,499
Now.

202
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,360
<i>Listen, Jibraan,</i>

203
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,236
I understand you had to try.

204
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,364
But don't do it again.

205
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,425
Your brother's life depends on it.

206
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,035
Yes, okay, please,
just don't hurt him, okay?

207
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,955
- Well, that's up to you.
- Yes, I'll do whatever you say, okay?

208
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,366
I won't cause any more problems.
I promise.

209
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:32,491
All right.

210
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:34,711
Do you remember your instructions?

211
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:36,576
Yes...

212
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,931
Westbound Red Line
to Washington Center.

213
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,678
We'll be watching.

214
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,931
<i>We're always watching.</i>

215
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,035
- Hello?
<i>- Ms. Taylor, this is Agent Pierce.</i>

216
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:22,467
Yes, Aaron?

217
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,508
Secretary Woods was asking for you.

218
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,972
You told me you were
retiring to the residence,

219
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,691
<i>but upstairs detail confirmed
that you're not there.</i>

220
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:32,060
Why is Tim looking for me?

221
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,738
The Justice Department is investigating
the Jonas Hodges car bombing.

222
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,964
<i>They're requesting
phone and internet records</i>

223
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,153
<i>and want to interview
everyone, as well.</i>

224
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,362
I didn't realize
Justice was getting involved.

225
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,635
Apparently, there were only 11 people
who knew Hodges was alive.

226
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,459
It stands to reason
that information was leaked.

227
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,496
- Okay, I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Where are you?

228
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,575
I needed to run a personal errand.

229
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,611
Ma'am, am I to understand that you've
left the White House premises

230
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,788
without Secret Service protection?

231
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,805
I won't be long, Aaron. Ten minutes.

232
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,942
Ms. Taylor,

233
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,060
this is a serious
breach of protocol.

234
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:08,529
Your safety is my responsibility.

235
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:12,225
Aaron, I know.
I promise you it won't happen again.

236
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,951
<i>Just cover for me till I get back?</i>

237
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:18,732
Will you do that for me, Aaron?

238
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,651
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,819
Thank you.

240
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,827
This is a mistake.
We shouldn't be meeting.

241
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,457
Calm down. I needed to see you.
You were hysterical on the phone.

242
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:39,375
No, you don't understand!
There's an investigation.

243
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,783
The Justice Department
is asking about my whereabouts!

244
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:46,560
Did you think no one would bat an eye
when a government witness was murdered?

245
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,018
I told you I changed my mind.

246
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:50,736
I didn't transfer the funds.

247
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:53,172
The man you put me in touch with
said he wouldn't act

248
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:54,980
until he received payment.

249
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:57,896
Why would he go ahead
and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid?

250
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,356
Because I told him to.

251
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,108
What?

252
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,506
He called me and told me
the money hadn't come through yet.

253
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:06,571
I told him you were
good for it and to proceed.

254
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,313
Why, Martin?
Why would you do that?

255
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:10,408
Hodges was going
into Witness Protection,

256
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,827
there was
a finite window of opportunity.

257
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,490
And because it's what you wanted.
Right?

258
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,463
Despite all my warnings
for you to reconsider,

259
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:19,793
you looked me in the eye

260
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,380
and you said you wanted Hodges dead,
to make it happen.

261
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,727
And I did, and he's dead.

262
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:29,376
Oh, my God...

263
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,429
But my phone records...

264
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,035
- my computer... everything...
- Don't worry about any of those.

265
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,719
I'll send you a program
to erase your internet tracks.

266
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:38,174
The calls to me mean nothing.

267
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,581
Olivia, the time to worry
about your conscience

268
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,871
was before you put this in motion.

269
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,279
If you let this eat away at you,

270
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:50,076
people are going to notice
and get suspicious.

271
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,235
You will bring us both down...

272
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,727
destroy your mother
and her administration.

273
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:58,227
Think about it.
Is that what you want?

274
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,581
Okay, then pull yourself together.

275
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,185
I promise you,

276
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,549
this will all pass
if you do what I say.

277
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,178
Can you do that?

278
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:11,988
Say it.

279
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,639
I can do it.

280
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:21,168
You need to transfer the funds,
Olivia.

281
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,190
You do not want
this man unhappy with you.

282
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,460
- Hey, honey.
- Sorry I woke you.

283
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:41,775
<i>No, no, no, that's okay. I've been up
with Teri a couple times anyway.</i>

284
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:45,128
She's been having a rough night.
I think she misses her mother.

285
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,271
Listen, I just called to let you know
that my flight's been delayed.

286
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,125
How long?

287
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,678
Well, they're saying an hour.
Which probably means two.

288
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,499
Okay.

289
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:57,503
What?

290
00:16:57,628 --> 00:17:00,148
I don't know, maybe
you should see this as a sign.

291
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:01,273
A sign?

292
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:02,937
That you should stay there,

293
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,822
try to convince your father

294
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:07,651
that he should be spending whatever time
he has left with his only daughter.

295
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:09,942
As much as I want to,

296
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,818
he made it very clear

297
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:14,074
that he does not want me around
to watch him die.

298
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:17,406
Okay, all right.
Sorry I brought it up.

299
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,738
<i>Teri and I will be at the airport
to pick you up.</i>

300
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,214
My battery is dying.

301
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:26,575
Is the hospital okay with that?

302
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,905
<i>Yeah, I talked to Kevin.
He said he'd cover my rounds.</i>

303
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,994
Well, that's great.
Well, I can't wait to see you guys.

304
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,775
- I love you.
- Okay, bye.

305
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,813
- Oh, excuse me, sorry.
- That's all right.

306
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,870
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, sorry.

307
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,805
<i>This stop, L Street.
This stop, L Street.</i>

308
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,249
<i>Next stop, Washington Center.</i>

309
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:50,788
<i>Next stop will be the last stop.
Next stop, Washington Center.</i>

310
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,466
The package is in place.

311
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,966
The dispersal mechanism
is set to go off

312
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:59,026
while the train is stopped
at Washington Center.

313
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,027
Good, we're on the move.
I'll pick you up at 22nd.

314
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,486
Jack, I unlocked
Tony's location data.

315
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,153
- Where is he?
- Three blocks

316
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,198
immediately south
of your position on 22nd.

317
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,116
Where exactly on 22nd?

318
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,452
West side of the block
you're coming up on.

319
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,787
<i>900 feet ahead...</i>

320
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,498
800 feet...

321
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,715
All teams, bring your units up
from the south and prepare to move in.

322
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,848
<i>- You're almost on him.</i>
- Okay, we've got him.

323
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,686
Suspect is in a black van.

324
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:36,542
We can't let this turn into a pursuit.
Hold on.

325
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,048
Hold on!

326
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,033
Tony was trying to destroy
some kind of device when I grabbed him.

327
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,744
I got it!

328
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:11,224
Lock down this piece of crap.

329
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:15,521
- What do you got?
- Some kind of mobile computer,

330
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:16,757
he damaged it badly.

331
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,592
It has something to do with the attack.
Contact Chloe, see what we can find.

332
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm gonna sweep the van
for the canister.

333
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,993
<i>Tony's UMPC device
is damaged everywhere I look.</i>

334
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,072
I don't think
I can get it back up and running.

335
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:50,275
Try a partial reconstruct. Anything
to find out what Tony's been up to.

336
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,042
At this point I don't even know
about our chances of even doing that.

337
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,294
- Chloe.
- I know.

338
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:56,379
Do me a favor.
Send me your screen.

339
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:58,917
- Why?
- Why not?

340
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:07,949
What?

341
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,979
Looks like I can reconstruct the memory
of the UMPC at the time it was damaged.

342
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,487
- No. There isn't enough intact data.
- Yeah, there is, in the PROM module.

343
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,484
A lot of devices
back up their memory there.

344
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,476
That can't be done,
not without the file headers.

345
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:22,601
Really?

346
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:26,907
- Almeida just regained consciousness.
- Thank you.

347
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,068
Stay with this.

348
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:39,772
I need you to walk away.

349
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,408
Please, you and your men
just walk away.

350
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,527
Where is it?
Where's the canister?

351
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,904
I am not going to stop
until you tell me where it is.

352
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:17,198
Why did you betray me?

353
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:22,173
Why?

354
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:29,302
I have nothing left to lose.

355
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,327
You tell me where that canister is,

356
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:33,518
or so help me God,
I'll lay you down right now.

357
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:37,685
You think I've got
anything left to lose, Jack?

358
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:40,953
Do it.

359
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:57,292
<i>There were a number of applets running.
We can run them on our hardware.</i>

360
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,509
<i>I'm uploading a mirror to you now.</i>

361
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,005
- <i>You should have it.</i>
- You think it's Jibraan?

362
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:03,943
I can't tell. But whoever it is,

363
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:07,176
they're southbound on Connecticut
at 30 miles an hour.

364
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:10,204
And they just went right through
St. Matthew's Cathedral

365
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:12,849
- and out the other side.
- He's got to be on the Metro.

366
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,396
Yes, the Red Line
ending at Washington Center.

367
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,156
Washington Center's the target.

368
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:21,604
Put these in the car.

369
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:26,365
Jack, we have Jibraan.

370
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:53,064
Jibraan is on the Metro,
headed toward Washington Center.

371
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:55,836
Chloe, it's Jack. I'm back on comm.
How much time do we have?

372
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:57,310
Not long.
He's almost there.

373
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,335
Okay, listen. Tony had to be able
to communicate with Jibraan somehow.

374
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,691
See if they were using some frequency
strong enough to work in the subway.

375
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,135
Looking...

376
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,370
Wait.
There's a proprietary K-band running.

377
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:11,699
- That's it.
- Okay. Patch me through.

378
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,469
<i>Go ahead, Jack.</i>

379
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:18,875
<i>Jibraan, my name is Jack Bauer.
Can you hear me?</i>

380
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,279
Your brother is safe.
I'm working with the FBI.

381
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:24,545
The man who was holding him
has been taken into custody.

382
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:28,883
- Let me talk to Hamid.
<i>- He's not with us right now.</i>

383
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,630
No. I need to talk to him.

384
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:33,971
<i>Jibraan, listen to me.
Your brother is safe, but you are not.</i>

385
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,706
The people who are doing this,
they gave you some kind of a package.

386
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,769
No. They didn't give me anything.

387
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:43,444
We've got real time coverage
of the station.

388
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:46,734
Jibraan, these people are trying
to frame you for a terrorist attack.

389
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,945
<i>They had to give you
some kind of a package.</i>

390
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:53,533
It has to be on the train.

391
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,907
<i>I want you to start looking for
an abandoned suitcase,</i>

392
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:59,455
<i>- knapsack, anything like that.</i>
- No, I can't tell. There's nothing.

393
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:01,249
It has to be there. Keep looking.

394
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:05,878
It was a woman.

395
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:09,347
- What woman?
- She was with them when...

396
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:12,677
when they took Hamid.
I think I saw her get off the train.

397
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,986
Are you pulling
into the station right now?

398
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,134
I want you to stay on the train
and wait for the passengers to get off.

399
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:43,666
It's a bomb, isn't it?

400
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:45,109
It's a biological weapon.

401
00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:47,211
If it goes off,
a lot of people are going to die.

402
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,467
Are all the passengers
off the train?

403
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:53,271
<i>- Can you see the package?</i>
- I don't know.

404
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:56,362
<i>Jibraan, keep looking.
It's got to be there.</i>

405
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,228
- Yes. I see it. I see a duffel bag.
<i>- Okay.</i>

406
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,682
I need you to open it.

407
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,944
Wait. Why me?
Why must I do this?

408
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,323
Now, you're the only person that can
and if you don't, people are gonna die.

409
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,055
Jibraan, I need you to open the bag.

410
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,701
Look, I know I'm asking you a lot.

411
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:24,429
Please.

412
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,035
<i>Jibraan, are you still there?</i>

413
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,633
It looks like a bomb.

414
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:36,231
I see a light.

415
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:39,388
It's a timer.
It's counting down.

416
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,308
- <i>How much time is left?</i>
- One minutes, eighteen seconds.

417
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,273
That's not enough time for us
to get down.

418
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:45,987
I want you
to get the device outside.

419
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:49,315
There's an escalator to your right.
I want you to start moving now.

420
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,089
<i>I'll meet you on the street.</i>
<i>We're about a minute out.</i>

421
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,048
- That's him.
- Hold on!

422
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,008
I have to get out.

423
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:17,760
What is that?

424
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,512
Is that even yours?

425
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:23,432
I have a bomb. Okay?

426
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,268
This is a bomb. Get back!

427
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,270
Get back. I have a bomb.

428
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:47,164
Wait, he's with us.
Jibraan!

429
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:50,401
Jibraan. I'm the man who was talking
to you. Give me the canister.

430
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:51,836
These men will help you.

431
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:30,178
- Is he all right?
- Yes.

432
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,127
- You're Mr. Bauer?
- Yes.

433
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,296
You did great.
Thank you for everything.

434
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:38,007
I want to see my brother.

435
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,426
I know.
We're going to bring him here.

436
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:44,589
But I'd like you to go with Agent Moran,
so he can take your statement, please.

437
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:47,994
Follow me.

438
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:00,237
It's all right.

439
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,877
- You need a shot.
- I already did, 20 minutes ago.

440
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:04,352
It's not working.

441
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:06,506
It's okay.

442
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,330
We stopped it.

443
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,201
You can finally rest.

444
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,492
- Can I have a piece of paper?
- Yeah, sure, you can have all this.

445
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:48,323
What's that?

446
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,594
This is section "A",
the only thing I want.

447
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,752
I'll give it to you
as soon as I'm done.

448
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:01,911
Excuse me,
do you mind if I sit here?

449
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,436
No, of course not.

450
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,187
- You heading home?
- Yeah.

451
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:11,934
Us, too.
We live in Glendale.

452
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,436
Woodland Hills.

453
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,421
My husband's parents live there.

454
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:16,981
You know the Pelusos?

455
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:19,155
I don't think so.

456
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:23,654
- Do you mind doing me a favor?
- Sure.

457
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:28,302
Do you see the man behind us at a table?
He's wearing a suit.

458
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,130
- Short, dark hair?
- Yes.

459
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:35,679
Yes, is he staring over here?

460
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:37,307
No.

461
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,736
You know him?

462
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,130
No, it's just that
he was staring at me earlier.

463
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:43,270
Well, you're very pretty.

464
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:49,054
- What?
- No, he's moving away now.

465
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,561
I've got her in sight.
She's waiting at the gate now.

466
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:57,271
They should board within the hour.

467
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,230
I know
that the bioweapons threat is over,

468
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:02,390
but I'd feel a lot better if you'd watch
over her until she gets on that plane.

469
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:04,198
<i>I'll let you know
when she's in the air.</i>

470
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:05,323
<i>Thanks.</i>

471
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:07,683
Contact the Bureau Office.

472
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:10,281
Tell them we need an interrogation
package ready for when we arrive.

473
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:11,875
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

474
00:31:19,982 --> 00:31:21,044
I just got word.

475
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:23,719
Jonas Hodges was killed with a car bomb
less than an hour ago.

476
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:24,608
What?

477
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,342
- How?
- We don't have any leads yet,

478
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,638
but somehow the people he was working
for found out he was still alive.

479
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,420
They're going to be coming after Tony.
We need to transport him in a convoy,

480
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:37,087
full guard detail, weapons ready.
We're not losing him again.

481
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:49,281
The FBI located Al-Zarian.
There was nothing we could do.

482
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,450
You're telling me
the canister is gone.

483
00:31:56,184 --> 00:31:57,184
Damn it!

484
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,389
Without that pathogen, everything
that we've worked for is finished.

485
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:05,491
You should also know
the FBI has Tony.

486
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:07,925
Then you need
to have him eliminated.

487
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,234
- Alan.
- He knows too much, Cara.

488
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,177
We can't take the risk that he'll break.
You need to take him out.

489
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:16,202
I'm trying to tell you
that won't be necessary.

490
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,720
Tony won't be in custody for long.

491
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,630
- What are you talking about?
- Trust me.

492
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:23,346
We've got another play.

493
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:26,741
You'd better have.

494
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,742
<i>The incoming flight from Boston
will be arriving shortly.</i>

495
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:35,786
<i>Once the passengers have deplaned</i>

496
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,597
<i>and the maintenance crew is given
a chance to clean up the aircraft,</i>

497
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:40,339
<i>we should be able to begin boarding.</i>

498
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:42,209
<i>We appreciate your patience.
Thank you.</i>

499
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,831
At least we know
the plane's on its way.

500
00:32:44,956 --> 00:32:47,048
I'll believe that when I see it.

501
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,583
I'm gonna get some coffee.

502
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,342
- Does anybody want anything?
- I'll take a decaf.

503
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,930
- Nothing for me, thanks.
- Come on.

504
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,766
- Are you sure? It's my treat.
- No, thank you.

505
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:04,002
Your husband's really nice.

506
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:06,214
He has his moments.

507
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,580
You know what?
I'm gonna use the restroom.

508
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:10,945
Do you mind watching my bag?
Thank you.

509
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,852
- Miss Taylor.
- Agent Pierce.

510
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:58,137
I know you're upset I went off protocol,
as I told you, it won't happen again.

511
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,908
No, ma'am, it won't...

512
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,725
or you'll need to find
someone else to do this job.

513
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:05,962
Aaron, that won't be necessary.

514
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,901
You said you left the grounds
to run a personal errand.

515
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,875
May I ask what it was?

516
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:18,425
I just needed to get out of here,

517
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,618
be alone, clear my head,

518
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,170
if only for a short time.

519
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:28,746
Everything that's happened today...

520
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,744
being held hostage,

521
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:33,097
Jonas Hodges' murder...

522
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:38,830
and seeing my father
so weak and vulnerable...

523
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,921
I was feeling overwhelmed.

524
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:51,356
Aaron, I'm trying to live up
to my mother's expectations.

525
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,677
And I didn't want her...

526
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,656
or anyone else for that matter...

527
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,581
to know I was being affected
by the pressure.

528
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:05,584
I hope you can understand that.

529
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,920
Yes, ma'am,

530
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:09,822
I think I can.

531
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:12,961
You feeling all right now?

532
00:36:14,736 --> 00:36:15,986
I am, actually.

533
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,219
I guess I just needed to tell someone
what was going on with me.

534
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:25,105
I'm glad
it was someone I could trust.

535
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:27,852
Thank you, ma'am.

536
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:30,429
I'll have those phone
and internet records

537
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:33,240
ready for the Justice Department
investigators shortly.

538
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:35,022
Yes, ma'am.

539
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:40,676
Thank you, Aaron.

540
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:04,308
- This is Kanin.
- Sir, this is Agent Pierce.

541
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,960
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No, Agent Pierce,

542
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:08,183
I'm wide awake.

543
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:10,805
<i>- What can I do for you?</i>
- Mr. Kanin,

544
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,230
some years ago,

545
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:15,067
while I served
on President Palmer's detail,

546
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,869
I was made aware
of some modifications

547
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:19,997
made to the Chief of Staff's office.

548
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:21,683
<i>During Mike Novick's tenure.</i>

549
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:26,761
Specifically the installation
of a voice-activated recording system.

550
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:30,080
It allows staff meetings
to be logged and archived.

551
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,407
If you're asking whether
I used the recording equipment,

552
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:33,882
the answer's yes.

553
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,120
Did you disconnect it

554
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:38,422
when you resigned
and left your office?

555
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:40,465
No. Why you asking?

556
00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:43,369
I'd prefer not to answer that
at this time.

557
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,430
I need to know
how to access the digital recorder.

558
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
You can't.

559
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:51,268
It's secured with a biometric lock.
You need my thumbprint.

560
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:53,770
Look, Aaron, if you want my help,

561
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,899
<i>you're gonna have to tell me
what this is about.</i>

562
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,152
Olivia Taylor's
still using my office.

563
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,612
<i>Does this have to do with her?</i>

564
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:06,408
I really can't talk about this
over the phone right now.

565
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:10,537
I'll be at the White House
within a half hour.

566
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,082
Thank you, sir.

567
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,301
Do you have something
you'd like to say to me?

568
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:47,324
- Like what?
- I think you know.

569
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:49,201
I don't think I do.

570
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:52,349
How about "Good job, Janice,
on reconstructing the UMPC"?

571
00:38:52,474 --> 00:38:54,788
Or "Just maybe I should have
considered the possibility

572
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:56,677
"that you actually know
what you're doing."

573
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,963
You don't know me, but if you did,
you would understand

574
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:02,172
that this is the last place you should
look for any type of validation.

575
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,694
How about just acknowledging
you were wrong?!

576
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,061
- We're almost ready to go.
- Okay.

577
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,286
Is this her?

578
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,650
Yes,
but when I saw her in the Metro,

579
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:19,273
she had on this dark wig
and a leather jacket.

580
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:23,402
Your brother's here.

581
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:28,965
Let's pack up.

582
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:53,745
The coffee place over here...
excuse me...

583
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,225
didn't have decaf,

584
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,647
so I had to go all the way
to the other end of the terminal,

585
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,172
but I want you to know...

586
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:02,858
I got it.

587
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Thank you.

588
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:26,528
This is Bauer.

589
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:29,544
I'm sending a link to your phone.
It's something I think you should see.

590
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:31,643
Who is this?

591
00:40:32,587 --> 00:40:34,337
Open the link, Mr. Bauer.

592
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:44,511
Who the hell is this?

593
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:46,594
<i>Your daughter's
in the company of our operatives.</i>

594
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:49,154
And Agent Franks
has already been neutralized.

595
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,798
<i>You will help Tony Almeida escape
or my people will murder your daughter.</i>

596
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:56,622
<i>Any effort to contact her
or warn anybody about this</i>

597
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:58,992
<i>will have the same result,
do you understand?</i>

598
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:01,032
What you're asking me to do
is impossible.

599
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:03,677
Tony Almeida's already been secured.
He's under heavy guard.

600
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:05,302
That's your problem.

601
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:07,899
Put this call on your earpiece
and keep the line open.

602
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:10,008
I'm gonna be listening
to everything you say.

603
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:11,646
<i>Now, Bauer.</i>

604
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:34,099
You're gonna pay
for what you did to Larry.

605
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,215
I thought you were going with Moran.

606
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:43,501
Changed my mind.

607
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:46,169
I wanna see this through.

608
00:41:52,273 --> 00:41:54,715
<i>You're gonna make your move
to break Almeida out soon.</i>

609
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,790
<i>I'm gonna tell you what to do
and when to do it.</i>

610
00:41:58,496 --> 00:41:59,683
And Mr. Bauer,

611
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:02,533
<i>if any of those agents in that van
get in the way,</i>

612
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:05,827
<i>you will have to eliminate them,
or your daughter will die.</i>
