3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,936
- Tell me what you know.
- The hitter has someone on the inside.

4
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,356
Victor Aruz told me
right before he died

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,150
that the assassin's working with someone
very close to President Hassan.

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,445
Someone hacked into the U.N. database.
They downloaded the security protocols,

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,894
the schematics to the U.N.
and Hassan's personal itinerary.

8
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:34,909
Did you get a name?

9
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,746
The computer's owner is listed
as Meredith Reed. She's a reporter.

10
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,290
- Applied for clearance at the U.N.
- We got a match.

11
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:43,292
Everybody move back!

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,377
This way.

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,162
Mr. President.

14
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:49,377
I can't believe she's part of this.

15
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:53,094
If this affair becomes public,
it will destroy your credibility

16
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,637
and all you've worked for.

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,848
I just spoke to my brother.
I told him to deny the affair.

18
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,518
The reporter's claims
need to be discredited.

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,730
CTU needs to continue to think
she's my contact on the inside.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,482
We might have the wrong person.

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,385
We've scan through the traffic cam
from outside Reed's apartment building.

22
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,655
This man was going into
the service entrance.

23
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,090
What if he went through her apartment
and used her laptop to break in?

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,444
- He hailed a cab when he left.
- See the medallion?

25
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,414
Phone the cab company.
Find out where it went.

26
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:27,712
Hands in the air now!

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,047
Against the wall!

28
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:32,675
Chloe tracked the man in the photo
to a second location.

29
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,887
- We didn't think you'd follow through.
- So you steal weapons from the armory.

30
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,391
- Would you have done it if I'd asked?
- I'm not debating this anymore.

31
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,269
You want to waste your time
chasing ghosts, knock yourself out.

32
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,189
Hello?

33
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,232
Dana Walsh.
Il like that.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,025
I told you to stop calling me.

35
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,111
Yeah,
I know what you told me, Jenny.

36
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,362
You must be mistaking me
for someone else.

37
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:56,616
That's funny
'cause you sound a lot like this girl

38
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,368
I used to know from Rock Springs
named Jenny Scott.

39
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,999
- Hey, Mike, what's going on?
- Mind if I come in?

40
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,041
Oh, Mikey.

41
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:08,627
Call Captain Ravello.

42
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,547
Tell him you're sick,
and I'm filling in for you.

43
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,424
Son of a bitch, there's no way...

44
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,760
What's the matter with you?

45
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,471
Next time I won't miss the bone.

46
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,181
Make... the call.

47
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:32,193
This is Hastings.

48
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:34,820
Tell me you've gotten something out
of that reporter you arrested.

49
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,214
I'm pressing her,
but she's maintaining her innocence.

50
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,365
She's a co-conspirator
in an assassination plot.

51
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,057
Of course she's gonna deny it.

52
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:44,215
I need to be able to tell the president
we're making progress.

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,000
Our only course is to go after Miss Reed
with the evidence we have.

54
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,961
Our top analyst is decrypting a file
we obtained from her laptop.

55
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:54,464
We're hoping it provides the intel
we need about the assassin.

56
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:56,128
It'd better provide something

57
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,505
because if your people fail,
and President Hassan is killed,

58
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,587
<i>this peace process dies with him.</i>

59
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:03,140
- <i>Do you understand me?</i>
- I understand your concern,

60
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:06,030
but I assure
you we're on top of the situation.

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,147
I've dispatched tactical personnel
to liaise with U.N. security forces

62
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,408
and stepped up the alert
with NYPD at the perimeter.

63
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,400
Fine.
I'll have that to tell her at least.

64
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,648
Let me know
when that file is decrypted.

65
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,663
- You got a minute?
- You were on your way to the U.N.

66
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:36,102
I am. What's the status
on that file decryption?

67
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:39,093
We I.D.'d the cipher.
It's a standard Issacs-Adler algorithm.

68
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,084
Requires a 12-character decryption key
to unlock the data.

69
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:46,166
The search cycle has identified
two characters already.

70
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,478
Should have the rest
in about 30 or 40 minutes.

71
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,603
Why do you ask?

72
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:52,855
Jack Bauer just caused a big scene
with Hastings.

73
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,230
He thinks Meredith Reed
may have been framed.

74
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:58,968
He must have gotten that from Chloe.

75
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,866
- I thought that she'd dropped it.
- Apparently not.

76
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,921
She has surveillance of someone
exiting Reed's apartment building.

77
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:08,141
He thinks this person may have planted
the encrypted file on her computer.

78
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,616
You believe that?

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,900
I'm not sure.

80
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,896
If that evidence was planted,

81
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:16,589
the file you're decrypting is irrelevant
at best, at worst a misdirection.

82
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:20,550
Cole, I traced the U.N. breach
to Reed myself.

83
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:24,363
The biometric scans of her interrogation
all indicate that she's withholding.

84
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:25,972
I just don't see a frame here.

85
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,310
I hope you're right because
Jack's going after this guy on his own.

86
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,803
Hastings sanctioned that?

87
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,028
Not exactly.

88
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,232
Agent Ortiz?
We need to move out, sir.

89
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,129
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

90
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,080
I'm at the corner of Broadway
and West 23rd in Queens.

91
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,495
Any location on the suspect?

92
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,558
Negative.
I talked to the cab driver directly.

93
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,873
All he remembers
is dropping the fare at the corner.

94
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:59,626
- Nothing shows up in the archives.
- I need something to go on.

95
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,762
I know. I've been searching
for private cameras in the area.

96
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,125
Not all of them are registered.
Without the serial numbers,

97
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,680
I don't have access to them.

98
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,324
I'm gonna look around on foot.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

99
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,559
Stay on the line.

100
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,552
It's all right, Mags.
It's gonna be okay, right?

101
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,926
Keep your hand on the table
where I can see it.

102
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,458
Who the hell are you?
You're not a cop.

103
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:38,744
How did you manage
to fool everybody, Mikey,

104
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:40,868
or whatever the hell your name is?

105
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:46,777
Talk to me, you son of a bitch!

106
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,325
I don't want to hurt you, Jim...
or Maggie.

107
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,783
I am just doing my job.

108
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,044
This is the captain calling back.

109
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,347
Just say what I told you to say.

110
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,779
Please don't make me do anything
I don't want to do.

111
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,931
Koernig, Captain Ravello. What's up?

112
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,864
Captain, sorry to drop this
on you last-minute.

113
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,295
I just came down with some kind of bug.
I got to take a sick leave.

114
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,704
You could have told me earlier.
You're due at the U.N. in 20.

115
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,399
Yeah, I know. It's okay.

116
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:58,324
I asked Mike Farmer
to cover my shift for me.

117
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,132
<i>Farmer's already on in the morning.</i>

118
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:03,422
He doesn't mind working a double.
He could use the time-and-a-half.

119
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:07,509
Anyway, I told him he could use the bike
that I pulled from the motor pool.

120
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:09,928
All right.
I'll take care of the paperwork.

121
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,307
<i>Tell Mike to get his butt to Midtown.
You got that?</i>

122
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:15,855
<i>Get better, will ya?</i>

123
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:29,385
- You did well.
- I did what you wanted me to do,

124
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:31,832
all right, so...

125
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,903
Do what you got to do

126
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:35,623
and leave us alone.

127
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,453
We're not gonna make
any trouble for you.

128
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,082
- You still there?
- <i>Jack, go ahead.</i>

129
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,058
Hold on.

130
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:01,030
I got cameras overlooking the park,
one pointing straight at the corner.

131
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,322
I'm gonna get you
the serial numbers.

132
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,033
What you doing?

133
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:11,115
Chloe, I got to get back to you.

134
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,908
What's up?
You lost, man?

135
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:16,146
Actually, I am.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

136
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:19,456
Unless you a cop, look somewhere else,
'cause this is our court.

137
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,502
- We don't like strangers on it.
- I'm not looking for a problem.

138
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:27,050
My friend was let off on that corner
by a cab 20, 25 minutes ago.

139
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,866
I guess you didn't hear
what I'm saying, did you?

140
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,892
I've got a hundred bucks. Anybody can
tell me if they've seen this guy.

141
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:41,596
Anybody?

142
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,568
- I seen him.
- Yo, shut up, Jay!

143
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,826
What was he wearing?

144
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:52,489
- Green coat, black shirt.
- Where'd he go?

145
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,658
That light blue house over there.

146
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,910
I seen him go up the steps
to the stoop.

147
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,079
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

148
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:10,887
What you doing?
You don't even know what's going down.

149
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:14,328
I don't know about you, but I got
a hundred bucks. It's your play.

150
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,264
I'm about to take that hundred dollars.
Give me the ball, man.

151
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,002
Hello.

152
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,359
Got a call
from one of your neighbors.

153
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,602
Hello, Jack?

154
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,298
<i>What's happening?</i>

155
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:16,255
<i>Are you there...?</i>

156
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,805
Put the weapon down now.

157
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,540
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm working on behalf of CTU.

158
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,894
I'm investigating a threat
at the U.N.

159
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,051
- If that's true, drop your weapon.
- I can't.

160
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:31,759
My target killed two people here.

161
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:34,776
If I lower this weapon,
I'll be sidelined. That can't happen.

162
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,200
- What are you doing? He's down.
- Son of a bitch is a cop killer.

163
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,288
- John, stop! We got to call this in.
- Not yet we don't.

164
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,626
Help me get him in.

165
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:54,713
Come on! Help me get him in!

166
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,647
So where are we?

167
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,458
As of right now,
we've got half the decryption key.

168
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,633
That's all?

169
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:18,431
Can't we accelerate the program?

170
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:20,197
It's already
running at capacity, sir.

171
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:24,208
Sir, we just found this
among Meredith Reed's personal effects.

172
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,613
It's a dedicated key card,
United Nations issue.

173
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:29,169
- Issued to who?
- President Hassan and his family.

174
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,740
It accesses their private residence.

175
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:32,876
We got her.

176
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:39,136
<i>Ms. Walsh,
this is security at Perimeter Gate 9.</i>

177
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,711
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

178
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:43,509
- A visitor?
- <i>A Mr. Kevin Wade.</i>

179
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,160
<i>Says he's a friend of yours.</i>

180
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:00,476
Tell him I'll be right there.

181
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,330
This CTU...
some kind of government deal?

182
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:54,246
Law enforcement?

183
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,667
Ms. Walsh is on her way.

184
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:14,102
Look at you, all pressed and pretty.

185
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:21,976
- I think I like you as a blonde.
- What are you doing here?

186
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:23,788
I thought I told you
to leave me alone.

187
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,763
- And me, not to hang up on me, Jenny.
- Don't.

188
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,095
Don't call me that.

189
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:33,775
You want me to play along?
Okay, I'll play along.

190
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,701
But I won't let you pretend
you don't know me.

191
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:37,826
Fine.

192
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:42,166
You found me, so now what?

193
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,301
You think we're just
going to pick up where we left off?

194
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:50,180
Why not?
We had a good thing going.

195
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,160
No, we didn't.

196
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,726
I was naive,
and I let myself be taken in by you.

197
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:57,801
I am not that person anymore.

198
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,498
CTU.

199
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,123
Senior Data Analyst.

200
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,658
Well, sounds like an important job.

201
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,744
I'm thinking
you always were the smart one.

202
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:18,482
How did you pull this off? You steal
a dead girl's birth certificate?

203
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:20,904
Look, I have money.

204
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:23,289
Not a lot, but some.

205
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:25,214
If that's what it'll take.

206
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,930
If you really still care about me,

207
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,433
you'll leave me alone.

208
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:38,979
Say my name.

209
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:41,687
What?

210
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,432
If you're gonna beg,

211
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,458
I want to hear you say my name.

212
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,434
Just like you used to.

213
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,746
Say, "Please, Kevin."

214
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:04,916
Please...

215
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:07,235
Kevin.

216
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:09,315
There's my bad girl.

217
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,480
Damn it!
What do you want from me?!

218
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,221
A place to crash for starters.

219
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,682
- I'm getting tired of the van.
- That won't happen.

220
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Well, now you don't want me...

221
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,132
to tell everyone you work
with your little secret now, do you?

222
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:24,941
I don't want to do that.

223
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:28,673
Come on.

224
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:31,263
It'll be fun having me around.

225
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:33,307
It'll be just like old times.

226
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,411
You'll come home...

227
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,165
... and we'll catch up.

228
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,505
Fine, fine.

229
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,410
You can stay the night.

230
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,221
I want you out tomorrow.

231
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:02,947
Whatever you say.

232
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:07,653
Do you want my address?

233
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,236
I already got it.

234
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:28,273
I'm going to ask you again,
Ms. Reed,

235
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,897
and this time I want an answer.

236
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:35,608
Now we know that this key card
was issued to President Hassan

237
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,533
and his family at the U.N.

238
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,653
I want to know where you got it.

239
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,894
I'll wait my attorney to speak.

240
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,422
You're already looking at a life
sentence in a federal penitentiary.

241
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:49,956
So if this plot succeeds
and Hassan dies,

242
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:52,513
I promise you the death penalty.

243
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:57,158
If you give me the name of the assassin,
maybe we can cut a deal.

244
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,745
I told you I don't know anything.

245
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,532
- You know who you stole that from.
- I didn't steal it.

246
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,667
Then you manufactured it, cloned it!

247
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,777
And used it to gain access
to the U.N. security data.

248
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:12,716
- Where did you get it?! Tell me!
- He gave it to me.

249
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:14,300
Who?

250
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:18,117
- Who?!
- Omar.

251
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:24,227
Omar gave it to me.

252
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:28,993
Why would he do that?

253
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:34,058
So I could have access
to his private residence

254
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:36,446
when he wanted to be alone with me.

255
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,333
You really expect me to believe
you're involved with him?

256
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,667
Believe what you want.
It's the truth.

257
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:47,135
This is Hastings.

258
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,755
Put me through to Rob Weiss
at the U.N.

259
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,004
What are you doing?

260
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:53,284
I need to speak
with President Taylor

261
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,109
to get permission
to talk with Omar Hassan.

262
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:58,809
Now if there's something
you want to say to me, Ms. Reed,

263
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:02,183
- now is the time to say it.
- <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.</i>

264
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,929
<i>Mr. Weiss is in a closed session,
but they're expecting to break shortly.</i>

265
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,184
Just relay the message to have him
call me back as soon as he can.

266
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,309
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

267
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,810
Looks like you have a bit more time
to reconsider your story.

268
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,792
You let me know
when you're ready to change it.

269
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,132
I need your help.
I've lost contact with Jack.

270
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,135
He called me 15 minutes ago.
I haven't been able to reach him since.

271
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,693
This is your operation, Chloe...
yours and Bauer's.

272
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:43,602
I don't see
why this should be my concern.

273
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:46,473
He could be in some kind of trouble.
You need to send for backup.

274
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:48,592
Even if I wanted to,
we don't have the manpower.

275
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:52,120
I dispatched all field personnel
to the U.N. for Hassan's protection.

276
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:55,254
I watched the interrogation. I heard
what Reed said about her affair.

277
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,557
If that's true, it supports our idea
that she was framed.

278
00:19:57,682 --> 00:19:59,864
- And how do you figure that?
- Because it explains

279
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,658
why we registered her deception,

280
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:05,829
why the real insider within Hassan's
camp chose her to divert us.

281
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:07,328
Reed is lying.

282
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,166
- There is no affair.
- But what if there is?

283
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,417
If President Hassan corroborates
Reed's claim,

284
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:17,382
- will you send units to find Jack?
- All right, fine.

285
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:22,291
I'll have someone alert you
when Hassan calls me back.

286
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,551
- Is that good enough?
- No, but it's better than nothing.

287
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:39,195
That couple you murdered upstairs
were friends of mine, dirtbag.

288
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,821
Good people.

289
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,783
- Mazoni, you can't do this.
- No, what I can't do is watch

290
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,244
another creep like this
walk on a technicality,

291
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,622
or because some lawyer didn't file
the right papers to the right clerk.

292
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:53,459
I've seen it happen
more times than I can count.

293
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,681
You're new here, Phil. Wait till
you spend 15 years of your life

294
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:59,735
grinding your teeth in this job.
You talk to me then.

295
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:03,511
What about that thing he said?
About him working with CTU?

296
00:21:03,818 --> 00:21:06,097
- Did we find credentials on him?
- No.

297
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,892
That's because
he is a lying piece of garbage.

298
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:13,354
- This was a home invasion robbery.
- Where nothing was taken.

299
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,149
Because we showed up!

300
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,942
You don't like what I'm doing here?

301
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,576
Then go upstairs
and wait till I'm finished.

302
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,114
Go. Now!

303
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,979
And remember, you don't call this in

304
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,494
until I say so.

305
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:32,165
You stick to the story.
He was resisting arrest. You got that?

306
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:36,761
You got that?

307
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:39,854
Just...

308
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,133
don't kill him.

309
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:44,327
I'll do my best.

310
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,242
Farmer, what are you doing here?

311
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:51,142
Koernig called in sick.

312
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,152
- Stomach thing.
- No kidding?

313
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:55,772
I talked to him this morning.
He was feeling fine.

314
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,509
Probably a few too many at lunch.

315
00:21:57,634 --> 00:22:00,526
... continue to receive
real-time updates at the U.N.

316
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,585
CTU is confirming the link
between the Stinger missile attack

317
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,506
and the assassination plot
against President Hassan.

318
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:10,119
So, we're gonna push the traffic
perimeter out another six blocks

319
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,706
and close the Queensboro Bridge
in both directions until noon tomorrow.

320
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:17,433
Now, roadblock assignments are on pages
two and three of your briefing packets.

321
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:19,641
Go ahead and double-check those now.

322
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:23,709
CTU has also arrested
an individual inside the U.N.

323
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,677
who we believe
is a part of the plot.

324
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,554
Hopefully, this will yield some
information about the assassin himself.

325
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,832
Until then, we have to assume
that he could strike at any time

326
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:35,698
and will stop at nothing
to achieve his objective.

327
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:40,068
He's already killed five people that
we know of, including two CTU agents.

328
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:43,719
Whoever he is, he's a professional,

329
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:47,244
which means everyone is to be
on high alert at all times.

330
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,350
History is happening upstairs,
people,

331
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:52,870
and it's on our watch.

332
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,767
Our position remains unchanged,
Madam President.

333
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,557
We will not allow NATO
to transit supplies

334
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,477
- to Afghanistan through our territory.
- What about non-military supplies?

335
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:21,168
It is our belief
that any NATO deployment in the region,

336
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,806
military or otherwise,
will lead to more extremism, not less.

337
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,040
My director of Counterterrorism
here in New York

338
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,540
is requesting
to speak to you on the phone.

339
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:41,599
- Now?
- It's an urgent matter.

340
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:44,689
It's relating to the reporter
who was arrested earlier.

341
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:46,966
Mr. Weiss will escort you
to the conference room.

342
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,804
That is,
unless you have any objections.

343
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:54,182
No, not at all.

344
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,734
This way, Mr. President.

345
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:07,437
Do I have to remind you
of our conversation?

346
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,490
Omar, you must deny
your involvement with this woman.

347
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,265
She has a name, Farhad.

348
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:14,569
I still can't believe
she can be part of this plan.

349
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:17,165
That should not be
your chief concern right now.

350
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,449
If word of this affair gets out,
not only is your political career over,

351
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:22,824
but so is the peace process itself.

352
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:26,384
You know what you have to do.

353
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:35,761
- Thank you.
- Mr. President.

354
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,816
Mr. President,
this is Brian Hastings at CTU.

355
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:47,610
I appreciate you getting back to me.

356
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:49,688
What can I do for you, Mr. Hastings?

357
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:53,110
Well, sir, I have a matter
of some delicacy to discuss with you.

358
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:54,561
- Go on.
- Thank you, sir.

359
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:57,973
I know that your time is valuable,
so, I'll come right to the point.

360
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:01,124
I understand Meredith Reed
is writing an article on you

361
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,835
- <i>for the Sunday Magazine.</i>
- Yes, that's correct.

362
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,587
Do you know of any reason
she would be in possession

363
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,505
<i>of a key card
to your residence at the U.N.?</i>

364
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,301
- Key card?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

365
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,387
She claims that she got it from you.

366
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,848
And that your relationship
with her is...

367
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:19,195
<i>perhaps more than professional.</i>

368
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:26,608
Mr. President?

369
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,696
Is there anyone listening
to our conversation, Mr. Hastings?

370
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,682
- <i>Are we being recorded?</i>
- No, sir.

371
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,784
I'm speaking to you
on a secure line.

372
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:39,412
Then I will tell you
what Ms. Reed said is true.

373
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,843
Omar!
What are you doing?

374
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:46,077
Sir, are you confirming a romantic
involvement with Meredith Reed?

375
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:47,352
Mr. Hastings,

376
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:50,755
I trust your complete discretion
in this matter.

377
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,428
And I'm sure you understand
the ramification if what I'm telling you

378
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,222
- <i>becomes public knowledge.</i>
- Yes, sir, I understand.

379
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,047
I gave Ms. Reed this key card
for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.

380
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:05,236
I'm telling you all this
in the interests of justice

381
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:09,261
because I'm convinced
Ms. Reed is not part of this conspiracy.

382
00:26:09,386 --> 00:26:12,272
Excuse me for asking, sir,
but are you basing that certainty

383
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:14,572
on anything other
than your personal feelings?

384
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,700
No, I suppose not.

385
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:22,663
I see. Well, thank you
for your candor, Mr. President.

386
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,984
<i>I assure you that nothing we discussed
will be disclosed from this office.</i>

387
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:30,095
I appreciate that, Mr. Hastings.
Good-bye, then.

388
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
<i>Good-bye.</i>

389
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:33,883
Have you any idea what you've done?

390
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,135
The honorable thing.

391
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,881
You said you'd send backup
to Jack's location.

392
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,178
I said I'd consider it, and I have.

393
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:50,691
Confirmation of the affair
does not prove Reed's innocence.

394
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,610
It's a ploy she used to gain access

395
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,575
to the U.N. security files,
Hassan's itinerary.

396
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,959
- In the meantime, Jack's still missing.
- He's not missing. You lost contact.

397
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,155
His phone battery may have died.

398
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,096
Or more likely,
he's in an area with bad cell reception.

399
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:07,217
There's pockets of them
all over the five boroughs,

400
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,585
which you would have known
if you were from around here.

401
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:12,046
Fine, if you're not sending someone,
I'll go myself.

402
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,414
No, you won't!

403
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,119
Your concern for your friend
is admirable,

404
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:19,400
but that file we got off Reed's laptop,
it's almost decrypted,

405
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:21,832
and depending what we find,
I'm going to need you here.

406
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,157
Is that clear?

407
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,290
Now, earlier today, you suggested

408
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:28,990
that I speak to you
more clearly and directly.

409
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:31,691
You leave the building,
you're fired.

410
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,359
Is that clear
and direct enough for you?

411
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,217
We have a problem.
My brother confessed to the affair.

412
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:00,972
I don't know
if the frame's going to hold.

413
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,587
That's unfortunate.

414
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,249
Don't you understand?

415
00:28:05,374 --> 00:28:08,020
CTU won't believe the file you uploaded
to Reed's computer is genuine.

416
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,164
I agree it isn't ideal,

417
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:14,233
but they will still have to act
on what they find in any event.

418
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,547
There's no reason
to diverge from the plan.

419
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,086
But you need to remain calm
and play your part.

420
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:22,283
How much longer?

421
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:25,286
I promise you.

422
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:29,491
<i>Your brother will be dead
before the hour is out.</i>

423
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:16,670
Don't move!

424
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,547
Drop that! Now!

425
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:21,884
Everything I told you before
is true.

426
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:25,048
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a former federal agent.

427
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,657
He's lying! Shoot the son of a bitch!
He broke my damn rib!

428
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:29,199
Contact Chloe O'Brian at CTU.

429
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:31,727
She'll verify my identity
and the threat to the peace conference.

430
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,637
- Shoot him already!
- Sit back down, John.

431
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:36,700
You want to be pointing that gun
someplace else.

432
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:39,819
- I said don't move, either of you!
- What the hell? I'm your partner!

433
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:42,347
No, this has gone far enough.
I'm calling it in.

434
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:43,697
Don't do that.

435
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:46,778
Come on, Phil. Put the phone down.
Let's talk about this.

436
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:47,903
Shut up!

437
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:53,637
This is Patrolman Phillip Lu.
I need to talk to Lieutenant Sell.

438
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:56,597
The officer upstairs has to be connected
to the assassination plot.

439
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:59,046
You happy now? You hearing
what he's saying about Koernig?

440
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,549
There's a connection.
We need to find out what it is.

441
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,426
Both of you, shut the hell up!

442
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,386
Lieutenant, sir.

443
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:07,848
I'm at the scene
of a double homicide.

444
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,502
One of the victims is a cop,
a James Koernig out of Midtown Center.

445
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,237
No, it's definitely murder.
Him and his wife.

446
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,563
We got a suspect in custody.

447
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:20,949
11447 Broadway.
Cross street is Astoria.

448
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:23,864
Ask him what Officer Koernig's
assignment was today.

449
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,998
Please, innocent lives are at stake.

450
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:29,923
What have you got to lose?

451
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:31,499
And, sir?

452
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:34,665
I need a lookup
on Koernig's duty assignment.

453
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,960
Transfer me over.

454
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:48,403
You screwed up.

455
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:50,303
- What?
- Yeah, surprised me, too.

456
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,724
You forgot to upload a Rijndael filter
to my system.

457
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:55,853
I can't break the last encryption layer
on the file remnant you gave me.

458
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:57,938
I'm sorry.
I will upload it to a disk for you now.

459
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:00,931
Or I can just do it at your station.

460
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:02,318
Okay, fine.

461
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,259
Everything okay?

462
00:31:09,194 --> 00:31:12,369
- What do you mean?
- It's not like you to make mistakes.

463
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,737
You seem a little distracted.
Wedding jitters, maybe?

464
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:19,201
Just asking.

465
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,253
And Cole's a nice enough guy.

466
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:24,393
But I could see how you could start
having second thoughts.

467
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:27,190
I've always been curious to know
what you two find to talk about.

468
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:30,221
- Drop this, Arlo. I am not in the mood.
- I don't mean anything by it.

469
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,517
All I say is that you and the Boy Scout
aren't exactly intellectual equals.

470
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,602
Or is that what makes him your type?

471
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,148
See now, you and me, for instance,
we have a lot in common.

472
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,200
We speak the same language.

473
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:45,964
Mostly techno-jargon granted,
but it can always lead

474
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,275
- to something much deeper.
- Damn it, Arlo!

475
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:54,098
That's it.
We've got it.

476
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:02,102
Is that what I think it is?

477
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:05,265
Finish decrypting your fragment
and put it on the screen.

478
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,856
I've got to tell Hastings.

479
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:11,762
I don't care what he's demanding.
Tell Reed's lawyer he'll have to wait.

480
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:15,361
We can hold her for up to 18 hours
before formally charging her.

481
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:17,601
- Sir?
- I have to go.

482
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:20,640
We've broken the encryption code
on Reed's file.

483
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:22,915
The primary file component's
up on screen.

484
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,734
Arlo's waiting for a second piece
to finish rendering.

485
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,946
- So, what am I looking at?
- Plans for work carried out

486
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,916
at the United Nations 8 months ago.

487
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,825
- The U.N.? Are you sure?
- Positive.

488
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,779
Two I-beams were retrofitted
to provide structural support

489
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,089
for additional interpreters' booths.
There and there.

490
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:41,458
- It looks like the Council Chamber.
- It's below it.

491
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:45,631
The decryption's just about complete.
It's loading to the main screen now.

492
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,012
It looks like a schematic
for an incendiary.

493
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,807
A bomb. Pulse-detonated,
modified to fit between the I-beams.

494
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,470
Judging by the size,

495
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,796
that's big enough to drop the entire
Security Council into the East River.

496
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,607
Get me Cole and Manners at the U.N.

497
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:06,637
All stations!

498
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,612
We're implementing protocols
for an immediate evacuation

499
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,739
of the United Nations building!

500
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,032
We are Code Red.

501
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:15,951
I repeat: this is not a drill.
We are Code Red!

502
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,496
Sir, you need to consider
the possibility that this intel is fake

503
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,329
- and why they wanted us to find it.
- I'm not taking any chances.

504
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:24,895
- I've got Cole and Manners on line.
- Gentlemen,

505
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,048
<i>we have intel from the files that
an incendiary device has been placed</i>

506
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,509
<i>- directly below the Council Chamber.</i>
- Sir, I don't see how that's possible.

507
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,204
This building's been vetted for weeks.
Security have swept the area thoroughly.

508
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:39,266
Then they missed it.
Mr. Manners,

509
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,397
<i>you need to implement
evacuation protocols immediately.</i>

510
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,687
<i>Cole, I want you on President Hassan,
personally.</i>

511
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:46,812
Yes, sir.

512
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:48,901
You, you, with me!

513
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,069
Let's go!

514
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,497
Ladies and gentlemen,
forgive the interruption.

515
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:56,877
Your attention, please.

516
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:00,537
We are evacuating immediately
due to a possible bomb threat.

517
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,121
Security personnel will be receiving
protocol confirmation

518
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:05,384
on designated channels momentarily.

519
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:09,463
Evacuation will proceed out these doors
and down to underground parking level B.

520
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:12,091
Speak only
with your designated handlers.

521
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,301
- Everything will be fine.
- Mrs President, you

522
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,271
and Secretary Kanin need to move now.
President Hassan, if you'll follow me.

523
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:26,230
Traffic control, I need route lockdown
for northern exodus. All units confirm.

524
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:30,678
<i>Unit 2 in position.</i>

525
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,496
<i>Unit 3 in position.</i>

526
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:34,572
<i>Unit 4 in position.</i>

527
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,825
Unit 5 in position.

528
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,334
Where are my wife and daughter?

529
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,779
They're coming down the east stairwel.
No more than two minutes behind you.

530
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:06,533
I won't leave without them.

531
00:36:06,658 --> 00:36:09,967
Mr. President, with all due respect,
my orders are to evacuate you now.

532
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:12,836
Omar, I'll wait and go with them.
Don't worry.

533
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,289
I'll make sure they're safe.
Tarin, get my brother out of here.

534
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,890
All right, evac tunnel B!

535
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,104
Move!

536
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,903
- Yes?
- He's in the third car.

537
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:45,911
The motorcade's coming up the ramps
now.

538
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:51,545
<i>Vehicles are in transit.
Current location: evac tunnel bravo.</i>

539
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:54,838
<i>Second Avenue teams
should have a visual in five minutes.</i>

540
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,509
- Uncle!
- Where's Omar?

541
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:04,100
- He went ahead. We take the next car.
- Is it true there's a bomb?

542
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:07,249
It's just a precaution. Don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

543
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:08,527
Right this way.

544
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:11,185
Let's be quick. Hurry.

545
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:17,669
The guy who took his place?
What was his name?

546
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,640
<i>- Mike Farmer.</i>
- Thanks.

547
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,369
Come on. Get out.

548
00:37:31,604 --> 00:37:32,854
You were right.

549
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:34,618
There is a connection.

550
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,955
Sergeant Koernig
was on the U.N. security detail.

551
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,085
He called in sick
about 45 minutes ago.

552
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,242
He was forced to make that call.
You said someone replaced him?

553
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:46,015
A patrolman named Mike Farmer
from the same unit.

554
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,434
That's your assassin.

555
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:49,057
You need to let me call CTU

556
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,619
and I need to get to the U.N.
immediately.

557
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,116
This is going down now.

558
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:56,857
You can stand here and do nothing,
or you can help me stop it.

559
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:00,527
Make the call.
I'll drive you to the U.N.

560
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:01,835
Thank you.

561
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:09,433
Where the hell
you think you're going?

562
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:11,580
He can't leave!
He's a material witness!

563
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,652
<i>- Jack, where have you been?</i>
- Please just listen to me.

564
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:38,522
The assassin killed an officer
and took his place in the security.

565
00:38:38,647 --> 00:38:41,652
- I need to alert Agent Ortiz.
- Okay. I'll patch you through.

566
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,797
He's in the middle
of evacuating Hassan.

567
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,551
- Evacuating him? Why?
- Hastings' orders.

568
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:49,973
The files in Reed's computer indicated
that there's a bomb in the building.

569
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:51,340
Where's Hassan now?

570
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:53,945
His motorcade is heading up
the ramps in the parking garage,

571
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,418
- about to pull out onto 2nd Avenue.
<i>- Chloe, it's Cole.</i>

572
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,193
Hang on. I've got Cole.

573
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:01,296
<i>- Agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack.</i>
- What's going on, Jack?

574
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,174
- You need to stop Hassan's car now!
- What are you talking about?

575
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:07,496
The assassin is part of the evacuation
detail. He's posing as an NYPD officer.

576
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:10,667
There is no bomb in the U.N. They're
trying to lure him out of the building.

577
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,684
- Did you tell Hastings about this?
- We haven't time. Stop the motorcade

578
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,268
<i>before it hits the street.</i>

579
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:17,854
It's too late.
Hassan's car just exited the tunnel.

580
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,023
Cole, stop that car
or Hassan's a dead man.

581
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:32,723
Whose vehicle is that?

582
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,122
It's Cole.

583
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,515
<i>Cole, what the hell are you doing?</i>

584
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,488
What was that? What happened?

585
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,659
Cole, can you verify?
Was Hassan hit?
