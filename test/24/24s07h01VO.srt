1
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,450
How many do you have?

2
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,400
Five

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,070
Only five?

4
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,750
We got to the most of the boys had gone

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,170
I need soldiers not

6
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,260
I'll bring some more sir  i promise

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,600
Just give it to me

8
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,380
You will learn to fight like a man

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,830
For that i have no doubts

10
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,810
This

11
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,230
Would make you strong little soldiers

12
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,960
This would make you free

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,450
Gore

14
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,730
Take it

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,710
Ah... how is it make you feel

16
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,030
Powerful yes?

17
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,130
Gore

18
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,130
Your mothers and your fathers

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,360
They have made you weak

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,730
But general juma...

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,830
He will make you strong.

22
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,260
He will make you strong

23
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,400
So that you can take back the country from the government

24
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,860
And the traitors that work for them...

25
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,290
Like this cockroach here!

26
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,760
This cockroach

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,060
Who works for the government

28
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,430
And their white masters... yes, yes.

29
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Have mercy on me.

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,030
They have taken our land.

31
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,030
But soon, all that will change.

32
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,960
Soon, all the land will belong

33
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,860
To the people again.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
Soldier...

35
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,330
...you must buy our freedom

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,260
With the blood of this cockroach.

37
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,930
Please, no.

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,330
And you know what we do to cockroaches.

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,330
Kill the cockroach.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,290
Kill the cockroach!

41
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,290
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

42
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,860
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

43
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,160
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

44
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,660
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

45
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,930
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,090
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,230
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

48
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,230
Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach!

49
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,160
I thought i told you

50
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,890
To turn up the air-Conditioning.

51
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,630
All right, sir, i do, sir.

52
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,560
But we need another player.

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,760
Find somebody else.

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,960
Who? Tell me, willie,

55
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,930
Who can handle the ball better than you?

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,330
That's right, no one.

57
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
We're not supposed to go to town without mr. Benton.

58
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,190
Mr. Benton worries too much.

59
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,360
And so do you.

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,260
Hey, desmond.

61
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,730
Hurry or the bus will leave-- Come on. Let's go.

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,430
-You're not my father. -I'm your brother,

63
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,890
And you'll do what i say.

64
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,160
No!

65
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,030
Fine, then.

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,830
The truck is here!

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,030
The truck is here!

68
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,400
I wasn't stealing it.

69
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,560
I swear.

70
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,290
I was just looking.

71
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,360
Forgot these.

72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,960
Very pretty.

73
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,330
For a woman, yes?

74
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,160
I was gonna give it to my daughter one day.

75
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
You have a daughter?

76
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,860
Yeah.

77
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,130
Where did you get it?

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,130
Rajasthan.

79
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,360
India.

80
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,730
You ask a lot of questions.

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,860
That's what mr. Benton says.

82
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,630
I bet.

83
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,130
When were you there?

84
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,830
Last summer.

85
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,230
Before you came here?

86
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,290
Yes.

87
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,160
And before that, where were you?

88
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,630
Different places.

89
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,360
When are you going home?

90
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm not going home.

91
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,630
Look, i told the boys i'd help them unload the truck.

92
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,090
If you want that,

93
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,930
You can have it. Really?

94
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,890
Really.

95
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,530
Willie.

96
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,890
You're gonna have to give me back my knife though.

97
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,330
On. Hey, willie.

98
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,730
The supply truck's here.

99
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,060
Want to give them some help?

100
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,360
Look what jack gave me.

101
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,860
-Very nice. -It's from india.

102
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,700
Willie, go on.

103
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,990
Jack, this is frank tramell.

104
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,560
He's the ambassador's chief political officer.

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,030
I know who he is.

106
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,960
He says he left some messages for you

107
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,630
-To come see him at the embassy. -I got his messages.

108
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,890
What's going on, jack?

109
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,330
I'll tell you what's going on.

110
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,890
A senate subcommittee has questions

111
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,090
About the illegal detention

112
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,700
And torture of certain prisoners

113
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,760
I have a subpoena requesting you

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,360
To appear, and it's way past due,

115
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,330
So consider yourself served.

116
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,090
I told the boys i'd help them

117
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,530
Unload the truck-- Excuse me.

118
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,290
Failure to comply to a subpoena

119
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,990
Is a federal offense, mr. Bauer.

120
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,600
You are bound by law to respond.

121
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,800
Then give them my response.

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,500
If they want me back in washington,

123
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,190
They can come and get me.

124
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,160
The, uh, ambassadador said

125
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,330
That you and bauer

126
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,860
Were in special forces together.

127
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,990
How long has he been here?

128
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,700
A few months.

129
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,030
He never mentioned a subpoena?

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,800
Nope.

131
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,930
Well, he's been ducking it for more than a year,

132
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,460
Across three different continents.

133
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,930
Washington is leaning on the ambassador

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
To deliver him.

135
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
And now, the ambassador's leaning on you.

136
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,160
If bauer doesn't come back to the states

137
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,560
On his own, they'll come for him.

138
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,990
That would be a mistake.

139
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,730
You're doing god's work here, carl.

140
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,330
Between malaria and the wars,

141
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,760
These kids neverad a chance.

142
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,330
Now you're giving them a decent life.

143
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,330
It'd be a shame

144
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,860
If the funding dried up.

145
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,330
Don't threaten me, frank.

146
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
I'm just giving you the facts.

147
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,160
You're his friend.

148
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,430
Talk some damn sense into him.

149
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,960
Thank you, thomas.

150
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,430
There he is,

151
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,160
The mighty warrior

152
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,890
Who traded his gun

153
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,060
For a wheelbarrow.

154
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,890
Why are you here, hmm?

155
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,360
To do penance for all your sins?

156
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,260
You don't want to talk about it.

157
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,600
I don't blame you.

158
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,030
Hey, careful, don't drop her.

159
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,430
The government won't be able

160
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,260
To hold out against us for long.

161
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,060
Except we have more weapons than soldiers who can use them.

162
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,130
We need to overrun the main garrison

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,700
From the west.

164
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,090
We have minefields here and here.

165
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,160
Then i'll bring you more little soldiers

166
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,290
To clear them-- Do not worry.

167
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,460
Our father would be really proud, youssou.

168
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,400
Very proud.

169
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,190
You'll have your little soldiers.

170
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,160
Go.

171
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,160
This is colonel dubaku.

172
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,700
Hodges here.

173
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,600
I just heard some troubling news, colonel,

174
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,560
That your recruiting numbers are,

175
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,930
Are still coming up a little short.

176
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,260
I want you to know,

177
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,400
My offer stands.

178
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,760
I've got personnel standing by

179
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,960
Right across the border.

180
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,800
They can be deployed within the hour.

181
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,130
That won't be necessary.

182
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,160
Do some thinking now, colonel. I'm offering you

183
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,430
Professional soldiers,

184
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,560
Not children that you haven't had time to train.

185
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,160
You provided the weapons.

186
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,460
We will fight our own war.

187
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Well, it's your country.

188
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,560
It will be soon.

189
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,930
Is there anything else, mr. Hodges?

190
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,460
Yeah, tell general juma

191
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,990
To give me a call

192
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,290
When he gets there, will you?

193
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,500
I'll let him know.

194
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,930
Good.

195
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,090
That's one hard-Nosed son of a bitch.

196
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,890
It is his country.

197
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,330
But i'm paying for it.

198
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,460
I don't want those transactions traceable,

199
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,560
Mr. Nichols.

200
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,230
Not by the sec, the irs, or any of my ex-Wives.

201
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,090
You understand me, don't you?

202
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,800
John, what do you want me to tell you?

203
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,260
You've got to hang in there and be patient, my friend.

204
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,890
Yes, i know, i know-- Hold on, hold on.

205
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,360
Stop, stop, we got caught by the margin.

206
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,800
It's going to turn around.

207
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,860
Yes, yes, it is.

208
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,630
Yes, it is.

209
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,060
Yeah, you've got to give it time

210
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,400
And just... yeah, be patient.

211
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,430
Yeah. Okay.

212
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,560
Yes, yes. Okay, all right.

213
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,660
Bye-Bye.

214
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,830
Chris.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,660
Yeah?

216
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,890
Would you come in here please?

217
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,890
Who's that guy? A client.

218
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,560
I need you to close out

219
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,330
Abu dhabi and eritrea.

220
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,830
Burn the records and bury the ashes.

221
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,430
Go.

222
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,430
Jack?

223
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,890
Can i have a word?

224
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,890
Yeah. Willie, go on out to the truck.

225
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,990
Pick up another load.

226
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,830
I think you should take a look at this.

227
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,330
I don't need to.

228
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,860
I know what it says.

229
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,960
Don't worry, carl.

230
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,090
I'll be gone by dark.

231
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm not asking you to leave, jack.

232
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm asking you to have a conversation.

233
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,960
Tramell says this subpoena's been chasing you

234
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,400
For over a year now.

235
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,260
It's going to catch up with you sometime.

236
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,060
I'm not going back.

237
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,530
I'm not saying you should.

238
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
But a year's a long time

239
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,130
To spend looking over your shoulder.

240
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,990
A lifetime of that's

241
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,360
Going to drive you out of your mind.

242
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,630
Whatever 've done, i've paid for in full.

243
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,130
All i've got left is my freedom.

244
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,700
I'm not letting them take that away from me.

245
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,400
"Freedom." What kind of freedom is this, jack?

246
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,830
You're running away.

247
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,560
What do you want from me, carl?

248
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,800
I want you to trust me, jack.

249
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,160
I am your friend.

250
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,990
When you called me up

252
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,860
For the first time in what, ten years, i hoped...

253
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,890
You were maybe looking for something more

254
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,860
Than just a place to stay...

255
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,890
Trying to find a way to make some sense of it all.

256
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,400
It's a normal impulse.

257
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,700
Especially for people like us.

258
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,960
Ah, except you found what you were looking for.

259
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,530
Yeah.

260
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,290
Carl?

261
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,290
Carl!

262
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,460
I just meant it's different for me.

263
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,930
You know, i'm not sure i have found what i was looking for

264
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,990
But i have found a way to live with myself.

265
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,700
It took a long time.

266
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,530
The first thing i had to do

267
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,030
Was stop running.

268
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,230
I meant what i said, jack.

269
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,600
You can stay here.

270
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,630
Don't worry about trammell.

271
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
The state department's not

272
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,930
The only place with money.

273
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,660
I appreciate what you're trying to do, carl,

274
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,400
But this is my problem.

275
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,700
I'm not gonna let it become yours.

276
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,860
What you've done with this place...

277
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,630
The school, what you've done for the boys

278
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,090
Is worth protecting.

279
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,660
You and i both know

280
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,930
It will be better for everyone if i leave.

281
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm sorry, jack.

282
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,660
Me, too.

283
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,500
Me, too.

284
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,190
Thank you, carl.

285
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,060
Always.

286
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,230
Yeah.

287
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,660
You're spreading rumors.

288
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,290
You'll start a panic over nothing.

289
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,190
They're not rumors. It's the truth.

290
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,290
You are just a boy.

291
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,730
You do not know what you are talking about.

292
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,060
Juma is killing our children.

293
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,890
The united nations has no evidence of that.

294
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,090
What do you know?

295
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,160
This isn't even your country, huh?

296
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,760
What's going on?

297
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,130
Thomas is talking nonsense.

298
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,400
He's spreading rumors about juma.

299
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,030
"Rumors"?

300
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
They are not rumors.

301
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,660
Juma's soldiers have been crossing

302
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,560
The border and stealing our chdren.

303
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,700
Juma has no soldiers,

304
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,500
And he has no weapons.

305
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,800
Everyone knows that.

306
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,400
My cousin is missing. He went to the market yesterday

307
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,260
And he has not returned.

308
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,160
Then it was gun-Runners who took him.

309
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,230
Or someone from the diamond mines.

310
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,190
My brother is in town with james.

311
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,760
You see that, hmm?

312
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,960
Now you have the boy all worried.

313
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,060
He should be worried.

314
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,930
We should all be worried.  Stop it!

315
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,230
Both of you.

316
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,430
Keep sharp work, i'll go to town and see what's going on

317
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,090
Fine.

318
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,660
But you are wasting your time.

319
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,060
I thought i told you kids not to go into town

320
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,230
Without telling me.

321
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,890
Desmond never listens to anyone but desmond.

322
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,430
Where'd he go?

323
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,700
Playing football.

324
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,500
There's a field, just past the bridge.

325
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,990
I'll be back soon  benton!

326
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,090
You're not seriously

327
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,830
Worried about all of this, are you?

328
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,030
If juma was making trouble,

329
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,090
We would have heard something, no?

330
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,230
Probably. But this is sangala.

331
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm not taking any chances.

332
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,360
What'd you think that was, huh? Nothing.

333
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,560
What'd you say "nothing"?

334
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,460
Nothing. What'd you say "nothing," huh?

335
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,060
He's so powerful, guys.

336
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,660
Oh, you just threw the ball away... wow!

337
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,560
You wanna fight, do you wanna fight!

338
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Go to fetch the football, go fetch it, fetch it

339
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,230
Run!

340
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,130
You are now soldiers in the people's freedom army.

341
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,600
You will all have the honor of fighting the imperialists

342
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,660
Until we have taken back our land.

343
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,460
Samuel tells me you are from the american school

344
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,260
In okavango.

345
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,960
These americans make our people slaves.

346
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,030
But we will free you.

347
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
And we will free the other children

348
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,930
So they can become soldiers.

349
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,600
Take them.

350
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,990
Tell me your name.

351
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,630
Sive.

352
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,760
Louder.

353
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,930
Sive.

354
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
Are you a baby, sive?

355
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,530
I asked you a question.

356
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,860
Are you a baby?

357
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,890
No.

358
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,930
Good.

359
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,560
Because we need soldiers, sive,

360
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,500
Not babies who wet themselves.

361
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,360
Now stop crying, or i will stop you myself.

362
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,430
Commander!

363
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,130
Put them in the truck!

364
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,800
Go. Go!

365
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,160
What are you doing?!

366
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,290
Idiot!

367
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,290
They are no good to us dead!

368
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,290
Go!

369
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,930
With the inauguration less than two hours away,

370
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,300
President daniels is scheduled to meet with his successor

371
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,860
Here at the white house to review final details

372
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,500
For the transfer of power.

373
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,960
Their respective transition teams have been working

374
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,860
Together for several weeks to ensure a smooth turnover

375
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,100
Stop looking at me like that.

376
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,830
Shouldn't you be getting dressed?

377
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,000
We've got time.

378
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,760
Stop.

379
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,760
Hello.

380
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,530
Uh, i need to talk to you, rog.

381
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,930
Chris? Yeah

382
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,130
Uh, i think i might be in trouble.

383
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,060
Okay.

384
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,760
Are you using again?

385
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,130
That's not what this is about.

386
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,500
You didn't answer my question.

387
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,900
I can't, uh...

388
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,560
I can't really talk on the phone, okay?

389
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,990
I was hoping that i could...

390
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,230
I could meet up with you face-To-Face.

391
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,630
Now?

392
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,260
Hang on a sec, rog.

393
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,330
Chris?

394
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,300
I know, i know, i know, i know, it's terrible timing.

395
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,330
Believe me, i know.

396
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,760
But i wouldn't be asking if it wasn't really important.

397
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,130
I got to leave in 45 minutes, man.

398
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,130
I can be there in 20.

399
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,100
Chris...

400
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,130
I am not gonna stay long.

401
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,630
I swear, rog. Just please.

402
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,800
Do this for me?

403
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,600
Fine, but i'm out of here in 45 minutes.

404
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,400
Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,560
You're letting chris come here right now?

406
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,030
He's having some kind of relapser something.

407
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,400
What am i supposed to do? Exactly.

408
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,560
What are you supposed to do?

409
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,300
Make sure he calls his sponsor.

410
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,300
I don't know.

411
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,660
This is so chris.

412
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,400
He's been a friend for a really long time.

413
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,600
He got me my job.

414
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,600
Which, if he hadn't,

415
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,860
Stop it. I wouldn't have met you.

416
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,860
Don't do this.

417
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,460
Stop. Hmm?

418
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,960
Just don't be late for your mother's inauguration, okay?

419
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,160
Madame president.

420
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,160
Not yet.

421
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,230
This way.

422
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,530
How are you feeling?

423
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,630
Excited.

424
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,560
Nervous.

425
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,800
You should be.

426
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,200
In a few hours, you're going to be

427
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,460
The most powerful person in the world.

428
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,260
As if you're not already hard enough to live with.

429
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,260
Ma'am. Mr. Taylor. Tom.

430
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,400
The president apologizes he could not be here to greet

431
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,200
You in person, but something urgent has come up.

432
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,360
Something urgent?

433
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,430
Whatever it is, tom,

434
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,060
It's going to land on my desk in about two hours.

435
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,460
Could i just have a moment?

436
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,360
Don't be. Go ahead.

438
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,660
Our embassy in sangala just got word of an imminent coup.

439
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,930
How imminent?

440
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,230
Very.

441
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,330
Where's the president now?

442
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,630
He's in the telepresence suite.

443
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,330
He's on a secure line with prime minister matobo.

444
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,530
Juma is moving his forces toward the capitol as we speak.

445
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,960
This video was taken moments ago.

446
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,160
Mr. Prime minister,

447
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,230
This news has caught us all by surprise.

448
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,330
But our priority here in washington is to ensure

449
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,060
The safety of you and your family.

450
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,930
My priority is to defend my country from this monster juma.

451
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,460
And the only way that can happen is if you accelerate

452
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,330
The military assistance your congress

453
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,030
Has already pledged to us.

454
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,160
Unfortunately, i'm not in a position to make that happen.

455
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,660
Certainly not today.

456
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,200
What about your successor?

457
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,830
Will she be in a better position to help us?

458
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,960
I'm afraid i can't speak for her.

459
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,560
Will you excuse us for a moment?

460
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,930
Yes, of course.

461
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
You were right, sir.

462
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,300
Taylor does want to weigh in on this.

463
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,460
Where is she?

464
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,200
Just outside.

465
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,660
I'm sorry, mr. Prime minister,

466
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,500
But i have to cut this short.

467
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,260
The president-Elect is waiting for me.

468
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,800
Please, sir, convey to her

469
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,700
My request for military assistance.

470
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,100
I'll do that.

471
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,960
Mr. President.

472
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,130
Senator taylor.

473
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,100
Tom told me what's happening in sangala.

474
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,930
It is a damn tough situation.

475
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,460
Yeah, i don't understand.

476
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,730
How could juma raise an army

477
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,230
Without our getting wind of it?

478
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,100
We disarmed him three years ago.

479
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,260
The un's been monitoring the situation.

480
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,060
Not closely enough, apparently.

481
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,230
Then you have no idea who's supplying him?

482
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,060
All we know is, juma's secured

483
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,200
Some fairly advanced weapons systems,

484
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,100
Which is why prime minister matobo is asking for

485
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,000
Our military assistance.

486
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,060
And what did you tell him?

487
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,900
It's not a viable option.

488
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,260
You don't agree.

489
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,200
We have troops in the region.

490
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,960
A show of force might make juma blink.

491
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,360
And if it doesn't, we get caught up in

492
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,430
Another civil quagmire halfway around the world.

493
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,430
Now, that is a hard sell.

494
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,330
Especially when there's nothing in sangala worth protecting.

495
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,530
No natural resources, no substantial economic ties,

496
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,960
Nothing that threatens our national security.

497
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,330
The last time juma made a power grab,

498
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,700
He ignited a tribal war that killed

499
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,500
Tens of thousands of civilians.

500
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,460
Our involvement could avert a genocide.

501
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,800
And this war will be tragic, too.

502
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,730
But it isn't our war.

503
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,560
Which is why i've ordered the ambassador

504
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,760
To begin evacuating all

505
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,300
Non-Military nationals.

506
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,300
I think that's a mistake.

507
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,500
I n't want any americans

508
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,400
Caught in the crossfire when juma starts shooting.

509
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,800
Closing our embassy sends a signal to the world

510
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,500
That we are willing to set out a democratic ally

511
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,630
To a war criminal.

512
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,060
I appreciate your idealism.

513
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,560
I can't say the same for your cynicism.

514
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,300
Let's talk...

515
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,700
After you've been sitting in my chair for a while.

516
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,200
And until then,

517
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,100
We still have some transition business to go over.

518
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,130
So, i suggest

519
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,330
We get started.

520
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,900
Send in tom lennox.

521
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,100
Desmond?

522
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,330
Desmond.

523
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,430
Desmond.

524
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,060
Open your eyes. Open your eyes!

525
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,700
Oh, that's it.

526
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,630
Stay with me, desmond. Stay with me.

527
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,700
Open your eyes. Open your eyes!

528
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,000
Do not go to sleep!

529
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,160
Do you understand?

530
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,800
Do not go to sleep.

531
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,360
Good lad.

532
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,630
Don't go to sleep.

533
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,360
It's not heavy.

534
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,660
I can carry it.

535
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,700
I want to go with you.

536
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,460
Me and my brother desmond, too.

537
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,830
We can carry your things and work for you.

538
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,400
No.

539
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,260
Why not?

540
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,660
Because you can't.

541
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm going alone.

542
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,330
People who like to be alone

543
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,100
Are witches, my grandfather says.

544
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,900
Well, there you go.

545
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,900
Your grandfather wouldn't be happy

546
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,200
If you left here with a witch now, would he?

547
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,100
He would want me to go to america.

548
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,930
His favorite was elvis presley.

549
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,700
I'm not going to america.

550
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,230
Where are you going, then?

551
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,630
I don't know yet.

552
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,800
I don't know yet is better than here.

553
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,000
You sure about that?

554
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,930
Here doesn't seem so bad to me.

555
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,460
Mr. Benton is very nice,

556
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,600
But there are too many ghosts walking around.

557
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,100
Ghosts?

558
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,560
My mother,

559
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,030
My father and my three sisters.

560
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,600
They live in the bush and come out at night,

561
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,060
But you wouldn't see them because you are poo-Mui.

562
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,260
Poo-Mui?

563
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,900
A white person.

564
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,400
Willie, you and i are friends, right?

565
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,130
I want you to do me a favor as a friend.

566
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,430
I want you to stay here

567
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,700
With mr. Benton and help take care of the other boys.

568
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,760
Will you do that?

569
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,360
You promise?

570
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,460
Promise.

571
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,560
Okay.

572
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,730
Thank you.

573
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,460
Jack!

574
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,730
Benton's on direct connect.

575
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,460
He says he needs to talk to you.

576
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,400
Carl?

577
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,500
Jack,

578
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,030
James is dead, desmond's been shot.

579
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,900
What happened?

580
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,160
Juma's raising an army.

581
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,330
Desmond says they're headed for the school.

582
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,300
They're coming for the boys, jack.

583
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,660
You got to get them into the shelter.

584
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,830
Thomas knows where it is.

585
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,960
How many guns are coming?

586
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,160
Maybe a dozen. I don't know.

587
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,230
You have to hold them off till i get there.

588
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,760
Carl, you need to call the embassy.

589
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,700
Get them to send some marines out here.

590
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,530
I've been trying. I can't get through.

591
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,860
Jack, go into my room.

592
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,330
You'll find what you need in a locker under my sink.

593
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,960
The key's on top of the cupboard.

594
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,230
How far out are you?

595
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,930
Maybe five minutes.

596
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,730
Jack,

597
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,400
Don't let them take don't the children.My kids.

598
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,530
Carl, i won't. Everybody!

599
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,530
Everybody, i want you to listen.

600
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,000
I want you to go to the shelter with thomas.

601
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,600
He's gonna take you there now.

602
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,730
Go! What's going on?

603
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,560
I don't have time to explain, willie.

604
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,300
Just go with thomas, and ring the bell. Now!

605
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,330
What about my brother? Your brother's with mr. Benton.

606
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,500
Everybody, follow me!

607
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,500
Juma's men are coming. Do you have a weapon?

608
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,060
How do you know it's just not another rumor?

609
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,530
Do you have a weapon or not?

610
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,230
If they are coming, i will talk to them.

611
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,530
They will listen to me.

612
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,500
Save your helmet for the parade. There are coming.

613
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,100
Two of our boys have already been shot!

614
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,530
The united nations remains neutral in this matter.

615
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,860
Still want to talk to them?

616
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,860
I didn't think so.

617
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,830
Why don't you go hide in the shelter with the other children?

618
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,630
Are you the last? Yeah.

619
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,560
Wait!

620
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,500
Wait for me.

621
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,760
Find the boys.

622
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,130
Find them!

623
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,300
Fire!

624
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
No!

625
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,700
Do not kill him yet.

626
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,060
Not until he tells us where the children are hiding.

627
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,060
Bring him.

628
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,130
Stay here. Stay here.

629
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,500
Where are you going?

630
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,660
I'll be back in a bit.

631
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,990
U.S. Citizens only.

632
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,490
I have a sister in chicago.

633
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,730
She has a job.

634
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,860
She needs to sponsor you.

635
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,390
By then, it will be too late.

636
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,390
My husband died fighting juma.

637
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,800
Juma will kill me.

638
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,230
He will kill my child.

639
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,860
I'm sorry.

640
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,490
Whatever you want me to do for you, i will do.

641
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:58,190
Please, just take me from here.

642
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,490
Anything at all.

643
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,930
I can't.

644
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,160
I'm sorry.

645
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,690
Sir, it's carl benton.

646
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,130
Please don't let them

647
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,660
Kill my baby, please!

648
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,230
Please!

649
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,540
Benton?

650
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,730
I've been trying to get through to you.

651
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,260
Yeah, our lines are overloaded.

652
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,590
Juma's men are here.

653
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,990
-They're raising an army.  -We know.

654
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,330
You know?

655
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,230
Yeah, we don't know how he managed to pull it off.

656
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,090
No one saw it coming, but he's got soldiers

657
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,590
And they're moving in on the capital.

658
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,860
Well, they're here right now, frank.

659
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,260
They're at my school.

660
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,590
You have to send some marines to help.

661
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,630
Well, i can't spare any.

662
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,830
They're all being deployed for the evacuation

663
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,900
Evacuation?

664
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,990
The orders came down

665
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,060
From the president.

666
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,390
We're rolling up all u.S. Nationals.

667
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,860
We already started ferrying people to the border.

668
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,830
Frank, look,

669
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,990
I've got 14 kids hiding in a shelter,

670
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,390
And one is gonna bleed to death

671
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,590
If he doesn't get medical attention.

672
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,160
Look, if you want us to get you out,

673
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,530
You need to get here on your own

674
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,290
The last chopper's leaving in an hour.

675
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,090
Frank, don't... don't strand me like this, please.

676
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,630
-My hands are tied, carl.  -Frank...

677
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,260
-Tramell, please.  -I'm sorry.

678
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,800
Damn it!

679
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,060
Damn it.

680
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,730
I'm running out of ways to ask the question.

681
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:17,100
Where are the children?

682
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,100
You're wasting your time.

683
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,270
They're not gonna find anything.

684
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,230
I already told you they're not here.

685
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,100
You're lying.

686
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,440
No, i'm not.

687
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,030
If you want to find soldiers for your army,

688
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,670
You're gonna have to look somewhere else.

689
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,800
Where are the children?

690
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,100
I told you... i don't know.

691
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,830
I will keep doing this until you beg me to kill you.

692
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,030
But i won't kill you even then.

693
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:33,130
Not until you tell me what i want to know.

694
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,470
No.

695
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,270
Please, please, no, no!

696
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,200
I'll show you where the kids are.

697
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,200
Tell me.

698
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,500
I need to show you.

699
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,100
They're in an underground shelter.

700
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,570
No.

701
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,400
You will tell me where this shelter is.

702
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,530
Okay, okay, okay.

703
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,200
About 200 meters up the footpath.

704
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,870
Behind the tree line

705
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,030
There's a wooden hatch under a mound of dirt.

706
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,000
Please, please...

707
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,930
Get the children.

708
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,170
I'll stay here with him.

709
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,440
Don't worry.

710
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,270
Once i have these children,

711
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,900
I will kill you quickly.

712
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
You all right, jack?

713
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,470
Yeah.

714
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,700
The kids are in the shelter.

715
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,300
How is desmond?

716
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,600
He's lost a lot of blood.

717
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,170
The border's five hours from here.

718
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
I don't think he's gonna make it.

719
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,270
I'm gonna try and get him to the embassy.

720
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,400
They've started evacuating already.

721
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,100
How are you gonna get the kids asylum?

722
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,370
They're not u.S. Nationals.

723
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,170
I've got sponsorship papers.

724
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,670
Tramell's gonna let them in,

725
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,600
But i have to go now, jack.

726
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,170
The last chopper leaves in an hour.

727
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,370
You all right? Go, go!

728
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,700
Jack...

729
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,100
Good luck.

730
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,170
Stay here.

731
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,700
Jack may need our help.

732
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,000
And if they catch you,

733
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,900
They will make you tell them where we are.

734
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,630
You are endangering the rest of us.

735
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,870
We wouldn't have been in danger

736
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,370
If you'd done something about juma

737
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,070
Instead of looking the other way.

738
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,800
All right.

739
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,100
Everyone out.

740
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,200
Quickly.

741
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,270
Go to the bus, quickly.

742
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,070
Thomas, go get desmond.

743
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,670
He's in the jeep by the end of the footpath, all right?

744
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,000
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

745
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,630
Go to the bus, go to the bus.

746
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,770
Go to the bus.

747
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,630
Where is my brother? Thomas is gonna get him.

748
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,770
Then he's all right? He will be, he will be.

749
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,900
Go to the bus.

750
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,370
Quickly, quickly.

751
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,300
Desmond.

752
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,830
It's not as bad as it looks.

753
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,000
On the bus. Move. Quickly. Quickly.

754
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,340
Solenz?

755
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,670
Where are you going?

756
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,370
I told mr. Bauer before.

757
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,470
The united nations remains neutral in this conflict.

758
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,830
A un escort might help us get where we need to go.

759
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,000
Solenz!

760
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,800
Let him go.

761
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,770
He's just trying to save his own ass

762
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,170
Because he knows the children are a target.

763
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,400
You're gonna need my help, carl.

764
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,630
Juma's men are gonna set up roadblocks,

765
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,400
Checkpoints all the way into the city.

766
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,170
I got one of the soldiers' walkies.

767
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,170
We can use it to try and avoid them.

768
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,650
Jack

769
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,100
You won't have to go anywhere near the embassy

770
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,770
Just help me get the kids to the city.

771
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,270
You can head to the border from there.

772
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,200
Let's go.

773
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,960
Yeah,thank you,can you take it easy,please?

774
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,700
Just keep your hands where i can see them.

775
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,230
I thought i told you he's expecting me.

776
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,400
Hey,rog!

777
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,430
Rog,can you call your watchdog off,please?

778
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,630
Agent vossler

779
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,200
He's a friend of mine,you can let him in.

780
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,730
Thank you.

781
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,330
Your friend's jacked up on something.

782
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,060
I'll take care of it. It's all right.

783
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,800
I'll be outside.

784
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,600
Look,man,um,i know that my timing right now

785
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,830
Must,you know,suck,so thank you.

786
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,430
Uh,it's just,i'm...

787
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,660
I think i'm in a little bit of trouble here,so...

788
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,000
What kind of trouble?

789
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,460
Coke,pills?

790
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,030
Okay,you know what,don't get all righteous on me,rog,okay?

791
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,400
I seem to remember most nights

792
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,700
You party me under the table.

793
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,100
That was a long time ago.

794
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,000
Yeah,not that long ago.

795
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,400
All right,you got five minutes,so talk fauh...

796
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,160
Okay... a couple months ago

797
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,260
Nichols calls me into his office,

798
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,400
Says he wants me to manage

799
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:59,630
A special project.

800
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,060
Special project?

801
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,400
Yeah.That's what he calls it.

802
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,830
He says that he knows that i've taken some serious hits

803
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,530
In the stock market,and,uh,

804
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,830
He's gonna give me a chance to recover my losses.

805
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,260
I mean,the money he paid me...

806
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,530
Rog...

807
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,230
It was crazy.

808
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,330
All i had to do was keep my mouth shut.

809
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,130
What did he have you do,chris? Oh,you know,

810
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,500
Open a few offshore accounts,move a bunch of money

811
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,900
In and out,that type of thing.

812
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,130
So,you helped nichols embezzle money from his own firm?

813
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,000
Yeah,that's what i thought i was doing at first,

814
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,660
But,rog,three days ago,

815
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,800
Recognized the prefix on one of the accounts.

816
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,600
It's something the justice department has red-Flagged

817
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,600
For traders to report,okay,so...

818
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,000
Do a little digging

819
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,300
Turns out that the,uh,the account holder

820
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,500
Is on the terrorist watch list.

821
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:47,730
I know,it's crazy,

822
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,100
And it's all getting a little too weird fe.

823
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,460
This morning,there was this creepy guy

824
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,330
In nichols' office who...

825
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,500
Look,i don't know what he's doing.

826
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,130
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

827
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,830
I'm willing to turn state's evidence.

828
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,300
Yeah,good,you should go to the fbi.

829
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,430
Man,i was just thinking that,uh...

830
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,900
I could probably cut a much better deal

831
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,860
If we take this directly to your mother,you know.

832
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,430
You want my mother to clean up your mess?

833
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,430
Chris,what do you expect me to say to that?

834
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,130
What do i... i don't know,rog.

835
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,830
How about...

836
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,960
"I'm sorry to hear that you're in trouble,chris,

837
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,230
"But you're a friend of mine,

838
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,130
"And i'm gonna do whatever i can do

839
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,900
To help you out."

840
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,230
Do you even have any evidence?

841
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,760
Nichols asked me to destroy some records.

842
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,360
I didn't do it.

843
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,460
I,um...

844
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,460
I sent them to my hard drive at home instead.

845
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,400
They're coded,

846
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,130
But,you know,they're probably traceable.

847
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,830
Hello,chris.

848
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,900
Hey,sam,you look great.

849
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,830
Thank you.

850
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,300
We really need to leave now.

851
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,360
We're already pushing it.

852
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,360
Agent vossler's in the car waiting.

853
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,500
I'll meet you there.

854
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,260
I'm right behind you.

855
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,130
See you at work later?

856
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,800
Right.

857
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,800
I have to go. I know,i know,i know.

858
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,730
Look,look,if i forward you these records,

859
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,500
Will you at least show them to your mother?

860
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,760
I'm not talking to anybody until i see them for myself.

861
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,330
Okay,all right,that's...

862
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,900
Look,rog,thank you.

863
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,000
Just,can you check your e-Mail in one hour?

864
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,330
Clean yourself up,okay?

865
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,430
16 mortar teams supported by 20 forward observers.

866
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,660
Make sure we all have the same encryption codes.

867
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,700
And have a backup in case the government

868
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,500
To jam communication.

869
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,060
Sir,general juma is here.

870
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,030
Welcome home,general.

871
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,660
Colonel dubaku.

872
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,430
Look what you've built here.

873
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,060
Our american friends have been very helpful.

874
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,100
-Did they send us the howitzers? -Yes.

875
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,160
We have them in position about 20 kilometers

876
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,860
From the capitol.

877
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,200
We can hit any target in the city.

878
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:24,360
All we need is your order to begin the bombardment.

879
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,160
Sir... one of our checkpoints.

880
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,000
Excuse me,general.

881
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,100
Yes?

882
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,600
Colonel,this is lieutenant kintu,

883
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,160
Checkpoint delta.

884
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,700
We have a man in custody,a un relief worker.

885
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,230
He was driving is base,

886
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,760
But we have detained him for questioning.

887
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,600
He says he has information about your brother.

888
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:46,900
What sort of information?

889
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,960
He says your brother is dead,sir.

890
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,360
Your brother and his men... they were ambushed

891
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,960
At the american school.

892
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,430
He says that he can help us find the man who killed your brother.

893
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,600
I'll be right back.

894
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,630
I managed to stop the bleeding,

895
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,830
But desmond's fever is spiking.

896
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,660
If we don't get him to a hospital soon,

897
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,660
He's going to go into shock.

898
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,600
We're five kilometers from the city.

899
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,660
Carl,i'm really sorry about the school.

900
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,030
I know how much you put into it.

901
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,800
Just a bunch of cement and 2x4s,right?

902
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,060
What the hell was i thinking?

903
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:41,860
That things were finally let different here

904
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,760
That this country had turned a corner.

905
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,760
The bus is from the american school.

906
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,160
They are heading into the city

907
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,500
From okavango.

908
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,860
There is only one of two roads they can go.

909
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,830
I am seeing patrols on both.

910
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,300
This is patrol one,sir.

911
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:58,260
We have not seen a bus matching that description.

912
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,530
Where is your position?

913
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,560
Heading east,one kilometer west of okavango junction.

914
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,700
Jack

915
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,530
They're right in front of us.

916
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,560
Everybody,hold on.

917
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,300
Hold on.

918
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,900
What is it?

919
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,330
A rebel patrol.

920
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,760
Carl,we can't get back on that road.

921
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,600
Follow the river.

922
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:35,730
It leads into the city.

923
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,330
Desmond will not make it that far.

924
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,000
Then you help him,thomas,

925
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,860
But we're not getting back on that road.

926
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,230
Where are we going?

927
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,830
We're going to walk to the embassy.

928
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,230
Let's go,quickly,quickly.

929
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,530
The decision book.

930
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,030
Master protocols for the command

931
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:37,530
And control of our nuclear arsenal.

932
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,660
I never knew how much i didn't know till i read that book.

933
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,530
Are the gold codes in here?

934
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,360
Not yet.

935
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,160
Dan wilcox will deliver them to your designate.

936
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,300
All right, then.

937
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,230
Well, if we're finished here, i should get going.

938
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,830
Join me for a drink.

939
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,860
A toast to your administration.

940
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,360
As much as i'd like to,

941
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,900
It's still a little early in the morning.

942
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,000
You sure?

943
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,500
Yes.

944
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,260
To your administration.

945
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,860
Thank you.

946
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,660
Thank you, mr. President.

947
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,000
Thank you, mr. President.

948
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,600
Please extend my gratitude

949
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,730
To your transition team for all they've done.

950
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,330
You know what the talking heads are saying?

951
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,500
They're saying that i lost this election

952
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,760
Because i didn't want to win it.

953
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,360
They're saying that...

954
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,660
My heart wasn't in it.

955
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,000
What about you?

956
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,100
Me?

957
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,560
Do you agree with their opinion?

958
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:14,230
I don't believe there's a simple answer to that question.

959
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,030
You are right.

960
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,760
Nothing about this job lends itself to simple answers,

961
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,430
Just, uh...

962
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,460
Jagged edges and moving parts.

963
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,830
Most you won't even see coming

964
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,500
Till they've smacked you in the head.

965
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,230
So...

966
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,930
...be careful,

967
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,430
Madame president.

968
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,760
See you at the inauguration.

969
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,160
Are you all right?

970
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,630
I'm not sure yet.

971
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,230
Gentleman, we just got word of a coup

972
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,860
In sangala.

973
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,260
Daniels has ordered the embassy to evacuate

974
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,400
Without even consulting me. Is it the right call?

975
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,900
Right or wrong, he should have brought me in on the decision.

976
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,860
Maybe he's still bitter about the election.

977
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,200
Noah daniels isn't that vindictive.

978
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,560
You think he has a reason for pulling out of sangala

979
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,560
Before you take office?

980
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,860
Maybe.

981
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,430
I'll call ethan from the car.

982
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,860
If daniels is hiding anything about sangala, he'll be able

983
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,460
To dig it up.

984
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,030
It's definitely the bus from okavango.

985
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,600
They were here not too long ago, at least a dozen boys.

986
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,500
I don't care how many boys.

987
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:54,530
How many men?

988
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,830
Just benton,

989
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,990
Or is he with that bastard that killed my brother?

990
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,960
There were two men.

991
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,730
Along the river would be

992
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,930
Their fastest route.

993
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,130
Colonel dubaku.

994
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,260
I am sorry to hear about your brother, but i need you here.

995
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,060
Are you ordering me to stay?

996
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,000
Our campaign is just beginning, and you are

997
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,030
Critical to its success.

998
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,130
There will be time for you to avenge your brother

999
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,200
After we have taken power.

1000
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,700
The man who killed my brother

1001
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,730
Is heading toward the american embassy.

1002
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,230
They are evacuating within an hour.

1003
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,060
That is all the time i have

1004
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,630
And all the time i need.

1005
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,960
Sir.

1006
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,430
Excuse me, general.

1007
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,830
Sir, the men are ready, sir.

1008
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,830
Go.

1009
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,160
Go.

1010
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,500
Is this everything,

1011
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,600
Mr. Whitley?

1012
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,000
You've been stealing financial records

1013
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,230
From your office.

1014
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,430
Those files are private property, and i'm here

1015
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,300
To recover them.

1016
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,600
Is this everything?

1017
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,130
Uh, look, i, i saw something that didn't look right...

1018
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,900
Took it home to check it out--

1019
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,260
That's probably a mistake, and i... just calm down.

1020
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,430
Answer my questions.

1021
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's everything.

1022
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,230
It's all there. What about your laptop?

1023
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,530
Um, it's... it's in my briefcase if you want to check it.

1024
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,800
Did you make any hard copies?

1025
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,760
No, i swear.

1026
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,030
I... i barely even looked at those files.

1027
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,660
Who have you shown them to?

1028
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,860
No one. Nobody.

1029
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,830
So, um...

1030
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,530
Just erase it and then you take whatever you want

1031
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,830
Then you leave.

1032
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:33,000
Okay?

1033
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,600
Are we cool?

1034
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,830
Do we look like fools to you?

1035
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,960
Huh? No.

1036
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,330
Do we, do we? No.

1037
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,430
No.

1038
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,430
Then don't talk to us like we are.

1039
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,700
Okay. Sit down.

1040
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,630
Open your shirt, mr. Whitley.

1041
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,030
Why?

1042
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,330
Your shirt.

1043
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,300
What are you doing?

1044
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:57,930
You're going to tell us everything you know.

1045
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,830
And we'll know if you're lying.

1046
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,030
Just leave it alone, okay?

1047
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,130
Chris asked me not to tell anyone.

1048
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,660
I... i am not anyone.

1049
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,730
Come on, sam.

1050
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,700
I don't trust him. Then trust me.

1051
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,300
We're here, sir.

1052
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,560
You made great time, edward.

1053
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,100
Look, i know that chris is your friend.

1054
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,500
It's just this idea

1055
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,960
Of you having some kind of secret with him?

1056
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,060
I gave him my word that i wouldn't tell anyone.

1057
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,100
You need to respect that, okay

1058
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,060
Okay?

1059
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,200
Okay.

1060
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,400
Big turnout.

1061
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,930
It's crazy...

1062
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,060
Having a mother who's the hottest ticket in town.

1063
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,930
Vossler.

1064
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,030
It took some doing,

1065
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,130
But we managed to recover the files.

1066
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,530
What's our exposure?

1067
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,420
Unclear. We're working on it now.

1068
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,410
Find out and call me back.

1069
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,760
We're clear.

1070
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,500
Willie.

1071
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,700
Thomas... stay close.

1072
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,630
Jack...

1073
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,160
There's a road through those trees

1074
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,630
That takes us to the city.

1075
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,100
We should be safe when we get there.

1076
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,000
You follow the riverbed,

1077
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,000
That'll take you to the border.

1078
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,160
All right? You'll get there before dark.

1079
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,330
You sure?

1080
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,630
Jack, we'll be fine.

1081
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,830
Thanks for helping us get this far.

1082
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,630
Yeah.

1083
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,000
You take care of yourself, carl. All right.

1084
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,360
Carl...

1085
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,500
Carl.

1086
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,230
Shh, shh, shh.

1087
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,500
Get the kids in the trees.

1088
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,960
In the trees, now! Move!

1089
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,960
Run, run!

1090
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,400
I can't see them.

1091
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:27,700
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1092
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,860
Take cover! Take cover!

1093
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,260
Okay, put us down.

1094
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,100
We'll follow them on foot.

1095
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:06,960
Come on.

1096
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,560
That's all right. Let's go.

1097
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,230
Wait, come back. Come back.

1098
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:24,000
Willie, get back here.

1099
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,830
Stop! Stop!

1100
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,760
Jack...

1101
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,630
Stay there.

1102
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,900
Don't move. Don't come near me.

1103
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,360
I didn't want to leave this.

1104
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,200
I know, i know. It's all right.

1105
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,800
Go with thomas.

1106
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,700
Willie, it's all right.

1107
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:57,160
Come with me. Slowly, slowly.

1108
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,360
Stay on the path. Go with the other boys. Go.

1109
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,900
Forget it, jack.

1110
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:04,830
Just go.

1111
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,500
Take the kids and go.

1112
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,660
Damn it, jack. There's nothing you can do.

1113
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:22,800
Okay, it's round, in a gray casing,

1114
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:25,200
With a cyrillic b,

1115
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,960
And the number 291 stenciled on the side.

1116
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,260
Spring-Loaded.

1117
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,360
Russian antipersonnel mine, five kilo.

1118
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,060
I take my weight off and that's it.

1119
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,400
I'm going to try and disassemble the trigger mechanism.

1120
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:35,760
It's got an anti-Tamper system.

1121
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,430
That's all right; i'll find a workaround.

1122
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,700
Jack, even if you had the right tools,

1123
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,030
It'd take more than an hour to disarm...

1124
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:41,760
Damn it, carl, there's got to be a kill switch,

1125
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,200
Just let me find it. There's no time, jack.

1126
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:44,560
Stop. Just give me a second.

1127
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,830
Jack, stop.

1128
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,700
Stop!

1129
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,700
It's all right, jack.

1130
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,800
I can die like this.

1131
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:02,700
Just take the kids to the embassy.

1132
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:04,500
Make sure they're safe.

1133
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:06,500
Carl, don't do this.

1134
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:09,300
Here, take, take these.

1135
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,830
Papers, sponsorship papers.

1136
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,160
Give them to tramell.

1137
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,130
Please, jack, please.

1138
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,000
Give me the rifle.

1139
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:26,800
Let me buy you some time, jack.

1140
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,400
Maybe more.

1141
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,630
Go.

1142
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,260
Go, go.

1143
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,330
Go ahead with jack.

1144
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,800
I'll be right behind.

1145
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:08,800
Mr. Benton!

1146
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,600
I'll catch up.

1147
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,500
Go, go.

1148
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:15,960
We got to go.

1149
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,660
Please, come on, let's go.

1150
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,830
Yes. Okay.

1151
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,430
I'll tell him.

1152
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,800
Colonel, sir...

1153
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:52,130
We cannot follow them into the city.

1154
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,660
It's still under government control.

1155
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,630
Since when do you start giving orders?

1156
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,760
I spoke to udo.

1157
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,730
He has some men inside the city,

1158
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,960
Looking for benton and the other man.

1159
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,230
With the children, they won't be hard to find.

1160
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,960
Well, i will find them and kill them myself,

1161
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,730
Even if i have to go into the city.

1162
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,460
Now, go.

1163
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,200
Colonel dubaku, look.

1164
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,900
Who are you?

1165
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:54,860
I'm benton.

1166
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:57,530
Where's your friend?

1167
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,500
Which one?

1168
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,460
Where is he?

1169
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

1170
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,500
All right!

1171
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:28,160
All right...

1172
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,730
He's taking them...

1173
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,930
What?

1174
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,460
He's taking them there.

1175
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,430
What are you saying? Hmm

1176
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,600
What are you saying?

1177
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,360
He's taking them to...

1178
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,330
Bring him to me.

1179
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,760
Go to hell.

1180
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,600
What was that? Nothing, just keep moving.

1181
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,200
Keep going.

1182
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:07,460
Come on, move.

1183
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,030
Two more blocks that way.

1184
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,030
But we only have ten minutes.

1185
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,360
Okay, as soon as we get there,

1186
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:47,790
I'm gonna give you all the paperwork.

1187
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,330
I want you to give that to mr. Tramell.

1188
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,830
He's gonna take care everything from there.

1189
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,000
Then you're not coming with us?

1190
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,130
No.

1191
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,490
Where's mr. Benton? He's not coming.

1192
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,530
Why? He's dead.

1193
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:58,760
No!

1194
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:00,430
He was supposed to be behind us!

1195
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,360
He said he was coming!

1196
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,630
Willie! Willie!

1197
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,130
Willie!

1198
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,790
He lied!

1199
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,230
Stop it! Stop it! Why?!

1200
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,330
Stop. He lied to me.

1201
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,590
Why? Willie, mr. Benton did not lie.

1202
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:13,230
He made one promise to all of you boys,

1203
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,660
And that was to protect you and to make sure that you were safe.

1204
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:18,630
Mr. Benton died

1205
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,590
To make sure that juma's soldiers couldn't follow us.

1206
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:23,100
Mr. Benton died to make sure you could get to the embassy.

1207
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,960
Mr. Benton died to make sure that you woulde safe.

1208
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:36,260
I'm so sorry.

1209
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,200
Willie, we have to go.

1210
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:43,930
It's what mr. Benton would ve wanted.

1211
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,100
Okay?

1212
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,100
You okay?

1213
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:49,230
Come on. Let's go.

1214
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,330
Willie, come on, come on.

1215
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,330
It's okay.

1216
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,200
Come on.

1217
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,430
Let's got's go.

1218
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:04,960
Stop, stop.

1219
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,790
Thomas, take the boys, hide behind the car now.

1220
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,200
Move. Move. Get behind the car.

1221
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:10,490
Everybody, now.

1222
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,630
Down, down.

1223
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,160
Kill the cockroach.

1224
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,490
Kill the cockroach.

1225
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,330
Put the gun down.

1226
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,690
I don't want to hurt you.

1227
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,000
Just put the gun down.

1228
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,060
Willie, wait, wait, wait!

1229
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,330
I know you're scared.

1230
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,130
Just put the gun down. I'm not gonna hurt you.

1231
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,900
Just put the gun down now.

1232
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:16,460
You see those boys? They're just like you.

1233
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:19,460
I'm trying to get them out of the country somewhere safe.

1234
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,130
Somewhere where no one can hurt them.

1235
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,260
You can come with us.

1236
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,060
Just put the gun down.

1237
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,430
Come on.

1238
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,460
Just like me.

1239
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,530
Watch. See?

1240
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,360
It's going down.

1241
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,590
Like me.

1242
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,460
Come with me, i promise you no one will hurt you.

1243
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,100
No one will hurt you.

1244
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,460
Wait! Come on, jack, we have to go!

1245
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:43,060
We have to go now!

1246
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,360
Boys!

1247
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,100
Come with me now. Come on.

1248
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:48,230
Let's go.

1249
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:50,230
Everybody hold hands. Come on!

1250
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,460
Expecting a call?

1251
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,900
Hmm?

1252
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,930
This is about chris, isn't it?

1253
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,000
He was supposed to send me something 15 minutes ago.

1254
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,860
Call him later. Your mother's here.

1255
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,760
It's been a long journey, madame president.

1256
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:23,160
I'm afraid we're just getting started.

1257
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,030
Henry.

1258
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,260
Ethan.

1259
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,900
Our africa group is preparing a brief on sangala.

1260
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:31,660
You'll have it on your desk as soon as you're done here.

1261
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:33,460
Wo good morning.

1262
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:34,860
Good morning. Congratulations.

1263
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,060
Thank you.

1264
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,160
Good to see you.

1265
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,060
Thank you so much.

1266
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:44,430
You look beautiful, madame president.

1267
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,490
Thank you, samantha.

1268
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,060
Father.

1269
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,490
It's nice to see you on time for once.

1270
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,100
How are you holding up?

1271
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,030
It still doesn't feel quite real.

1272
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,960
It will soon enough.

1273
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:06,630
Whitley needed some encouragement,

1274
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,690
But he told my man everything.

1275
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,300
How much does roger taylor know?

1276
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,760
Nothing you need to worry about.

1277
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,900
But he knows nichols was involved.

1278
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:20,160
All he knows is that his desperate,

1279
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,460
Drug-Addicted friend told him some crazy story.

1280
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,830
He's got no evidence.

1281
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,830
If he finds nichols,

1282
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,560
He could find me.

1283
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,900
Not without evidence.

1284
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,860
Sir, whitley's no longer a problem.

1285
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,260
We limited the damage.

1286
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:43,000
But you haven't eliminated it.

1287
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:49,460
Keep your eye on taylor.

1288
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,930
Stay together!

1289
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,330
Sergeant!

1290
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,100
Sergeant! I need to see

1291
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,490
Frank tramell; he's expecting me!

1292
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,730
Who are you?

1293
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,430
Jack bauer!

1294
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,000
Stay with me!

1295
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,100
Don't worry, desmond!

1296
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,000
We made it!

1297
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:48,460
We're going to america!

1298
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,160
Tramell!

1299
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:55,030
Listen to me, i've got 14 children seeking

1300
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,030
Political asylum.

1301
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,730
All of them are r-1 status!

1302
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,460
One of them needs urgent medical care!

1303
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:01,560
Where's benton? He's dead!

1304
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,830
Wait! Wait!

1305
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,390
I've got their paperwork.

1306
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,390
Show me.

1307
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,630
Keep desmond up.

1308
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,560
There!

1309
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,790
Desmond, it's all right. Just stay with me.

1310
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,930
Come on!

1311
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,560
They appear to be in order.

1312
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:35,590
Good! Then open the gate, and let them in!

1313
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,390
There's just one small problem.

1314
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:38,460
They need the legal guardianship

1315
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,960
Of a u.S. Citizen.

1316
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,360
Guardianship?! I already told you, benton is dead!

1317
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:43,760
He died getting these children here!

1318
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:45,930
Then don't let him have died in vain.

1319
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,000
Surrender yourself to the subpoena,

1320
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,200
And the ambassador will waive

1321
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:50,430
The issue of guardianship.

1322
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,100
Tramell, i am warning you, leave me out of this.

1323
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:54,030
I'm afraid i can't do that.

1324
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,430
We are talking about innocent children.

1325
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,330
Whatever happens to them is all on you.

1326
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,060
You would really leave these children

1327
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,530
Out here in the street, knowing

1328
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,060
What you do about juma?!

1329
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,260
Damn it, frank!

1330
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,560
They'll be used as cannon fodder!

1331
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:08,730
Or slaughtered in the soccer stadium for entertainment!

1332
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,360
I am giving you the chance to make sure that doesn't happen!

1333
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,300
The choice is yours.

1334
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,130
I don't have a choice, you son of a bitch.

1335
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,390
Open the gate.

1336
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,390
Hold on, boys.

1337
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,360
Hold on.

1338
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,760
Desmond, come on!

1339
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:33,730
No, no, no.

1340
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,390
You in first, bauer.

1341
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,590
It's all right, willie.

1342
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:39,590
It's all right. It's all right.

1343
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,690
All right, take him into custody right now.

1344
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,660
Let them in! Let them in!

1345
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,030
Let them in!

1346

They're with me!

1347

Let them in, damn it!

01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:09,390

Just go with them. Go with the soldiers.

1352
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,360
Put them on the choppers.

1353
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,900
It's all right.

1354
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,030
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

1355

1368
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:10,590
Congratulations, madame president.

1369
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,460
Thank you.

1370
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,930
Thank you.

1371
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:32,000
When the founders of our country

1372
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:36,100
Boldly declared america's independence to the world,

1373
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:38,260
They knew that they derived

1374
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:42,430
Their power to govern from three basic human rights.

1375
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,630
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

1376
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:52,660
Today, we rededicate ourselves

1377
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,260
To the preservation

1378
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:58,660
Of those inalienable rights.

1379
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:00,260
But even as we carry forth

1380
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,790
The torch lit by those great men,

1381
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:07,460
We need to remember, its light don't

1382
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,360
Always shine as brightly as it should.

1383
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,690
It flickers and grows dim

1384
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:18,230
Because of apathy,

1385
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,690
Greed...

1386
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,900
And fear.

1387
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:27,560
De tocqueville said,

1388
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:29,130
"In every democracy,

1389
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,660
The people get the government they deserve."

1390
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:37,100
Today...

1391
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:39,860
I am asking each of you

1392
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,960
To help me give you

1393
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,560
The government you deserve.

1394
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,660
We all share the responsibility

1395
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:53,630
History has placed in our hands.

1396
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:56,260
The future--

1397
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,900
Our future--

1398
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,660
Depends on it.
