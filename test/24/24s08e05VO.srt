3
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:22,153
I need to know about my brother.

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,148
He's alive.

5
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,441
Get out now.

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,694
<i>It can't be long
before they realize it's you.</i>

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,932
I need you to get back in the car.

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,299
Your brother was involved
with the attack.

9
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:38,204
He's the insider
we've been looking for.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,332
- What's going on?
- The body triggered a hazmat alarm.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,793
- It's highly enriched uranium.
- It's weapons-grade?

12
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,748
- How did he come into contact?
- I think I know the answer.

13
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,632
Someone approached my brother
with weapons-grade uranium.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,546
Who?

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,386
Someone who had access
to decommissioned soviet stockpile.

16
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,005
You must find the russians before
they can get the uranium to my brother.

17
00:00:57,763 --> 00:00:59,356
I want proof that the rods exist,

18
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,654
- or you will not be paid.
- You want proof?

19
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,896
Come with me.

20
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:05,231
My younger son,

21
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:07,191
he was transporting the rods,

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,526
and he was careless.

23
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,569
There, you have your proof.

24
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,687
You were undercover for nearly two years
with the russian mob.

25
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:17,952
- Your cover is still intact.
- Are you asking me to go back in?

26
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,830
She hasn't been undercover
for over six years.

27
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,832
You're making a mistake
by putting her in.

28
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,531
You must have other options.

29
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,587
- She's our only way in.
- Then I want to go with her.

30
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:32,717
I assume your plan is trying to set up
a competing buy? I'll act as a buyer.

31
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:35,136
I'm looking for Vladimir.

32
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,595
Vlad disappeared.

33
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,274
But you can find him.

34
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,349
They know where I am 24/7.

35
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm still in prison.

36
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,144
Parole bracelet?

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,770
I can get this off.

38
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:47,815
- You can't cut bracelet.
- I'm not gonna cut it.

39
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,945
What the hell have you done?!
That's it, this is over.

40
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,114
Maybe for you,
but I'm just getting started.

41
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:10,918


42
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:13,583


43
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,551


44
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:19,847


45
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,728
I thought you were dead.
Where have you been?

46
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:29,148
It took me this long to get clear.
I'm with Bazhaev.

47
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,600
To hell with Bazhaev!

48
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:33,162
All we have worked for,
it's all over because of him.

49
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:35,165
It's not over, general.

50
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,568
Of course it is!
Your brother is still alive,

51
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:40,639
and your plan to replace him
as head of state is finished.

52
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:43,996
Now his security forces are rounding up
our people all over the city.

53
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:47,249
General Amiri was just pulled
from his home five minutes ago,

54
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,120
<i>in front of his wife and children.</i>

55
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,706
Look,
the americans won't let him continue.

56
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,698
They'll accuse him
of human rights violations

57
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:55,612
and threaten
to pull out of the peace talks.

58
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:57,195
Once we have the uranium,

59
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,386
my brother will become
irrelevant anyway.

60
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,354
You are being hunted like an animal.

61
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,308
- How do you expect to get the uranium?
<i>- Bazhaev can deliver it to us,</i>

62
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,723
but first I need payment
wired to his account.

63
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,949
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

64
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,901
Papa,
there's a clinic in Mt. Vernon.

65
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:39,862
I found a doctor who can treat him.

66
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,773
We have been through this.

67
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:44,233
- No doctors.
- Yes, but this one has a family.

68
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,323
I know where they are,
I know their names.

69
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:48,269
I'll make sure
he keeps his mouth shut.

70
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,052
And you can guarantee no one else
in this clinic will find out?

71
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,731
Another doctor, a nurse, no one?

72
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:56,533
The authorities know
about the nuclear material

73
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:59,655
or they will soon enough,
and they'll be looking everywhere.

74
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,104
Putting Oleg in a clinic
would lead them right to us.

75
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:06,622
He's going to die
if we don't get him help.

76
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,360
Then he's going to die.

77
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,904
But alone like this?

78
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:17,567
In a cold room behind the kitchen?

79
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,784
He's my brother, papa,

80
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:23,484
and he's your son.

81
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:30,944
All right.

82
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,969
Take him to the country house.
Ulana will look after him.

83
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,884
Thank you, papa.

84
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:42,484
- What is it?
- Farhad is asking for you.

85
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:54,573
You have news for me?

86
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:58,547
The money will be transferred
to your account shortly.

87
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,258
When can I take
possession of the rods?

88
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:03,637
As soon as we have the money.

89
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:06,739
Five hours.

90
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:08,635
Good.

91
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,660
I'll help you pass the time.

92
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:21,423
You have a preference?

93
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,157
Then take both.

94
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,339
He's still bleeding out.

95
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:42,743
This should cauterize the wound.

96
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,347
It's working.

97
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,852
- Who are you calling? Why?
- Hastings.

98
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,563
I'm shutting this operation down.
You shouldn't be in the field.

99
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,066
This was the only play.
You'd have done the same thing.

100
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,777
- The play was to get him to cooperate.
- He will cooperate.

101
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,335
- How do you figure?
- I know these guys.

102
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,197
The only thing that Ziya likes
more than 13-year-old girls is money.

103
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,418
He'd have butchered himself
for a score like this.

104
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:11,870
- Hastings needs to know the truth.
- The truth?

105
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,372
That you're unstable!

106
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:25,041
I don't blame you,
after everything you've been through,

107
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:27,720
but you are not fit
for this mission.

108
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:32,349
I went through a rough patch, yeah,
but I came out on the other side.

109
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,101
And I don't think you have.

110
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,477
The bottom line is,

111
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:40,141
I'm the best chance that anyone has
of intercepting that uranium,

112
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,400
I can do it now.

113
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,408
So, you making that phone call
or what?

114
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:02,400
He's waking up.
Better make up your mind.

115
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,029
Fine.

116
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:12,287
You see what you can get out of him.

117
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,677
But don't forget,

118
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:15,221
I'm listening.

119
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,035
Shut up, Ziya.

120
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,545
- You'll get painkillers soon
- What did you do?!

121
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:40,042
I got the bracelet off,
I did you a favor.

122
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,588
- You crazy bitch! You cut off thumb!
- What's done is done.

123
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,924
You can either stay here
and whine like a baby,

124
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,445
or you can come with me
and be a rich man.

125
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:53,130
I'm willing to give you
a point on this deal off the top.

126
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,133
It's a lot of money, Ziya.

127
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,894
- How much?
- Two-and-a-half million.

128
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,939
Maybe three when it's all done.

129
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,616
Two million?

130
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,401
You're serious?

131
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,820
You tell me.

132
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,160
I take this deal to Vladimir,
it's not real, you know what happens?!

133
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,121
Why would I be here
if this wasn't real?

134
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:21,780
Fine, forget it.
I'll find Vladimir my own way.

135
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:22,905
No, wait!

136
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,962
I don't know where he is exactly,

137
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,634
but where he might be.

138
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,951
Tell me.

139
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,721
No, I'll take you there myself.

140
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,516
<i>- You have a car?</i>
<i>- I have truck. It's parked out back.</i>

141
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,008
All right, I'll drive.

142
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:40,144
Come on!

143
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:46,325
I found out in my background check
that Ziya has a probation officer.

144
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,527
- How do you want to handle this?
- You don't need to.

145
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,040
- He has a tracking bracelet.
- Not anymore.

146
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,040
I don't understand.
They have anti-tamper mechanisms.

147
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:56,160
You can't cut them off
without triggering an alarm.

148
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,480
Trust me, it's been taken care of.

149
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,732
Jack, what happened in there?

150
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:03,452
Renee got the result she wanted.

151
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,833
Ziya's taking her to Vladimir.

152
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,880
Dana's still working
on your cover profile.

153
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,841
- They're moving.
<i>- I'll call you when it's ready.</i>

154
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,661
Jack's waiting
on the rest of that profile.

155
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:29,645
I'm still working the timeline.
Tell him I'm almost finished.

156
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:30,832
Okay.

157
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:37,576
You get that?

158
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,290
Yeah, probably should.

159
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,628
Hello?

160
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:46,162
I'm in the middle of something.
Hold on a second.

161
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:49,215
I'll send that profile to you
when I'm done.

162
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,844
I told you not to call.

163
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:58,285
I know what you told me.

164
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:01,934
But now that I'm here,
I just can't help but miss you.

165
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,938
My shift is over in the morning.
I will see you then.

166
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,106
That's just not
going to work now, is it?

167
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm busy, Kevin. Turn on the news
if you don't believe me.

168
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,279
That's not my problem.
I need to see you.

169
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,057
- You have 15 minutes.
- That's not possible.

170
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,543
Okay, you got 30.

171
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,856
Who said I can't be reasonable?

172
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,102
Don't make me call
your little boyfriend.

173
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:28,001
Rock his perfect little world.

174
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,249
"Hey, pal, congratulations.

175
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,976
"By the way, her name's not
Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott.

176
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:37,469
"Did I mention that she's an ex-con?
Nothing too serious.

177
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,185
<i>"Just accessory to murder is all."</i>

178
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,475
You still there?

179
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:45,519
I'm here.

180
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,110
See you soon.

181
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:59,068
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes, I'm available Saturday night,

182
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,526
and I can change my plans
for Friday if you want.

183
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,287
Also, I'm free on Thursday.

184
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:05,158
Arlo, I'm sorry.

185
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,958
A situation's come up,
and I have to go home.

186
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,584
We're in a major protocol.

187
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,212
I know,
and I won't be long, I promise.

188
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:14,214
But I need you to cover for me.

189
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:17,092
Finish the profile
for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.

190
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:19,136
If I ask what this is about...

191
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,263
- None of your business.
- Right.

192
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,448
I thought so.

193
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,349
Send it to Chloe
when you're finished.

194
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,392
Okay.

195
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:27,619
Thank you, Arlo.
I owe you one.

196
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:28,770
One what?

197
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,041
Thank you, Mr. Prime minister.

198
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:57,368
I look forward
to seeing you tomorrow.

199
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,466
I've spoken to 12 heads of state.
They're concerned,

200
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,515
but they're all still planning to attend
the signing ceremony.

201
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:07,559
I've got some bad news.

202
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:11,396
Killing president Hassan
was only part of his brother's plan.

203
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,300
CTU believes he's trying
to acquire weapons-grade uranium.

204
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,111
From whom?

205
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,056
A russian crime syndicate
in New York.

206
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:22,449
Half of them
are ex-soviet army or KGB.

207
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,712
If anyone had access
to unsecured stockpiles...

208
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:27,340
It's what we've been afraid of
since the wall came down.

209
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:29,391
Is president Hassan is aware?

210
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,306
He's the one who told CTU about it.

211
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,936
Hastings has initiated
an undercover operation

212
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,634
to recover the uranium
before it's leave the country.

213
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,174
The nuclear materials
are here on US soil?

214
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,141
- Are they sure?
- Afraid so.

215
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,471
Ethan, you asked if president Hassan

216
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,026
was aware of this. Why?

217
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,979
Helps explain what's been going
on in the islamic republic.

218
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:52,083
I just spoke
with our ambassador in the IRK.

219
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,648
Hassan's security forces
are sweeping through the capital,

220
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,984
arresting opposition leaders,
shuttering news organizations.

221
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,945
Has he declared martial law?

222
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,016
Not officially, but effectively,
that's exactly what he's been doing.

223
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,541
Who can blame him?

224
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,177
His brother is not alone.

225
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:09,983
We want Hassan cracking down
on hardliners in his own government.

226
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:12,214
Except that he's defying
his country's laws,

227
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:14,543
as well as his international
human rights obligations.

228
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,302
And if he continues,
it may delegitimize the peace accord.

229
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,799
Is president Hassan
back yet from CTU?

230
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:24,553
- He'll be here in 10 minutes.
- I want to speak to him. Alone.

231
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,055
I'll take care of it.

232
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:37,635
That's enough.

233
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,068
What's your problem?

234
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,438
<i>I need you thinking clearly.</i>

235
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,116
You tell me
you'd get me real painkiller.

236
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,656
Put it away.

237
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,309
I'm surprised.

238
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,825
I'm surprised
you take deal to him again.

239
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:02,161
After what he did to you.

240
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:04,593
How much further?

241
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:08,592
You don't want to talk
about Vladimir.

242
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:10,223
It's okay.

243
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,434
I don't blame you.

244
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,674
After all, what is there to say
about such a man?

245
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
Nothing good.

246
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,027
- Nothing very...
- Just tell me

247
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,990
how much further.

248
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:27,467
Ten minute.

249
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:30,355
Touchy, touchy.

250
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,972
Arlo just locked your cover profile.
I'm uplinking it to you.

251
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,711
Hold on one sec.

252
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:45,902
Okay, I got it.

253
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:48,790
You're taking me out
of Renee's comm when you call?

254
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:52,489
Go into her undercover file
with regards to Vladimir Laitanan.

255
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,518
I need to know
what happened between them.

256
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,062
- I'll call you right back.
- Okay, thanks.

257
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:07,197
Mr. President.

258
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,449
Your chief of staff said
it was urgent.

259
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,400
It is, but first,

260
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:15,205
I want to say again how thankful
we are that you're all right.

261
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,666
If this is about my security forces

262
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:19,918
and the necessary steps

263
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,499
I'm taking back home,
I'm afraid I can't help you.

264
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,760
Are you so sure they're necessary?

265
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,347
What happened today
was nothing short of a coup.

266
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:35,892
These same people are trying to restart
my country's nuclear weapons' program.

267
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,519
I understand, but...

268
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,812
I don't think you do.

269
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,484
Yours is an open society,
madam president,

270
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:44,037
governed by the rule of law.

271
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,528
Mine is closed.

272
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:49,076
The only real law is power.

273
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:53,159
Any perceived weakness on my part,
and I'm finished.

274
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:57,163
I'm aware of the complexities
of your situation, Mr. President.

275
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,231
My brother tried to kill me,

276
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,753
helped by elements
within my own government.

277
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,830
Those elements must now be purged.

278
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:09,618
Purged?

279
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,636
You mean, executed?

280
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,454
It is the only thing
my people understand.

281
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,708
I can't vouch for you
as a reformer, Mr. President,

282
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,186
if you renege
on your human rights obligations.

283
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,868
The world is trusting you
because I trust you.

284
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,917
You're asking me to show mercy
to enemies

285
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,980
who are trying to destroy me.

286
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,119
I am asking you
to find a middle way,

287
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,829
in the name of bringing peace
to a region

288
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:37,162
that hasn't known
peace for generations.

289
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,503
I need to see my family now.

290
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:07,753
- I found a doctor.
- A doctor?

291
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:11,036
Someone who can help you,
someone we can control,

292
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:12,572
but papa says it's too risky.

293
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:14,922
Papa's right.

294
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,505
Condemning you to death?

295
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,290
I don't believe that.

296
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,061
What happened...
was my own fault.

297
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,642
The family shouldn't have
to pay for my mistake.

298
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:29,442
All these years,
I thought it was an act.

299
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,209
But you really are the good son,
aren't you?

300
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:37,117
I'm no better or worse
than you, Josef.

301
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,848
You're my older brother.

302
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,351
You've always looked out for me.

303
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:52,582
What are you doing?

304
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,536
- I'm taking you to the doctor.
- But papa said we can't.

305
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,221
I don't care what papa said!

306
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,896
I'm not letting you die
without a fight.

307
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:24,955
You are old enough
to make your own decisions.

308
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,841
I've decided to stay.

309
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:28,440
As you wish.

310
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,150
You should stay, too.

311
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:31,401
I can't.

312
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,194
- Why not?
- You think

313
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,739
that your father is one way,
but he's not

314
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:36,937
what you think.

315
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,362
Stop doing that.

316
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:40,535
- You always do that.
- What?

317
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,371
Imply things, but you never
actually tell me what you mean.

318
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,139
It is better that way, Kayla,
believe me.

319
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:51,072
I don't want to poison you
against your father.

320
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,561
There.
You're doing it again.

321
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:56,692
- You can't help yourself.
- Doing what again?

322
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,762
Father!

323
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,330
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

324
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,505
- We thought that...
- I know.

325
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,481
I need to speak
to your mother now alone.

326
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,370
We have nothing
to say to each other.

327
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:28,208
Please.

328
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:31,926
Do you love her?

329
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,088
It's over.

330
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:35,607
I ended it.

331
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,391
You didn't answer the question.

332
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,094
Be honest for once.

333
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,847
Show me a little respect.
I'm your wife, damn it.

334
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:46,606
Do you love her?

335
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:51,689
Maybe I thought I did.

336
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,066
Then say it.

337
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:55,735
Does it matter?

338
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,253
It matters to me.

339
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,032
The truth is...

340
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:05,424
... I'm just glad I could
still feel something, anything.

341
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,740
And that's my fault somehow?
How dare you!

342
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:09,865
Our fault.

343
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:12,794
There's enough blame to go around.

344
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:15,215
- Dalia, please don't go.
- What?

345
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,924
I don't want you to leave.

346
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,303
Don't worry.
I won't make a scene.

347
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,965
You should know me better
than that by now.

348
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,806
My brother's a traitor.

349
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,899
My highest officers are
conspiring against me.

350
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,724
And now president Taylor

351
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,870
is threatening to pull out
of the peace talks.

352
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,008
It has been a long time
since you've asked my advice

353
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:43,951
about anything.

354
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,787
You were the one who always
gave me the best counsel.

355
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,720
Thank you for remembering that.

356
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:54,504
Then you'll stay?

357
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:10,435
It's too late for that, Omar.

358
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,560
Too much has happened between us.

359
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:17,793
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:46,679
Vlad operates out of here?

361
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,847
Sometimes.

362
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:49,891
He moved a lot.

363
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,244
<i>That's why cops
don't find him inside here.</i>

364
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,105
- <i>Come on, let's go.</i>
- <i>Hey, Ziya?</i>

365
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,886
Vladimir was never fond of surprises,
so I was thinking...

366
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:03,415
Maybe you could go in first?

367
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,940
Get him used to the idea
of me again.

368
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,451
Whet his appetite?

369
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,619
Exactly.

370
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:21,706
<i>Is our cover in place?</i>

371
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:23,091
Chloe got me everything.

372
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,395
Let's start going over
what happened in Mexico City.

373
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,011
How we met, who we dealt with.

374
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,429
Tell me about Vladimir.

375
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:32,767
- What do you want to know?
- What he did. I heard Ziya.

376
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:36,354
Come on, Jack, he's a drama queen.

377
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,190
Damn it, I am running this!
Stop messing with me!

378
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,808
I'm responsible for your safety.

379
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:43,319
When I ask you a straight question,
answer straight.

380
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,964
It was nothing, all right?

381
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,633
I handled him six years ago,
I can handle him today.

382
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:50,576
I only worry about locking down
this cover, so, please,

383
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,194
<i>let's not waste more time
on Vladimir.</i>

384
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:56,853
I'm a Munich-based arms dealer
named Ernst Meier.

385
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:58,814
We met in Mexico City.

386
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,633
You became my liaison to the locals.

387
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:11,855
Lugo.

388
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:13,489
Long time.

389
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:15,768
It's me, Ziya.

390
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,549
I know who you are.

391
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,522
What the hell are you doing here?

392
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:20,898
Business.

393
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:22,581
- Business?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:23,861
With Vladimir.

395
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:26,215
You've got business with me?

396
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,488
Vlad!

397
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:31,784
I should kill you for even
thinking of coming here.

398
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,867
Let me go, please!

399
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:37,522
Five years...

400
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,178
I've been living underground
five years and now you walk in here?

401
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,378
You're on probation!

402
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,464
No. Not anymore, Vlad.

403
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,050
Look.

404
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:48,426
She get bracelet off.

405
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,802
Who did?

406
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:52,430
It's what I'm trying to tell you.
Renee.

407
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:53,973
Renee Zadan.

408
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,976
She come to my place
looking for you.

409
00:23:57,377 --> 00:24:00,084
Yeah, she say she have buyer
that you'd want to hear about.

410
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:02,815
That it'd be good for all of us.
It'd be worth it for all of us.

411
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,614
She say where she'd been
these last five years?

412
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,572
Where everybody else was.

413
00:24:13,322 --> 00:24:14,160
In jail.

414
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:17,703
Then she go to Mexico City.
She got the opportunity there.

415
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,373
Mexico city?

416
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,595
What do you think, Lugo?

417
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,709
You believe this piece of dirt?

418
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:26,547
Sure I believe him.

419
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,300
He's too stupid
to make up a story like that.

420
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,719
It's her I don't believe.
I never did.

421
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,722
I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her.
She's not the one who sold us out.

422
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:37,113
She shows up out of the blue,

423
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:39,894
then 16 months later,
the feds are down our throats.

424
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:42,688
I'm just saying, Vlad.

425
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,406
You were just saying.

426
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:53,514
- Where's Renee now?
- Outside.

427
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,704
Clean yourself up.

428
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:00,303
Bring her to me.

429
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:22,145
- Where's Dana? She isn't at her desk.
- She went home.

430
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:23,473
Home?

431
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:39,453
- Who is it?
- It's me. You have my key.

432
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,916
Nice of you to drop by.

433
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,334
It's not funny.

434
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,219
What the hell? Who's he?

435
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,965
That's Nick.
It's a buddy of mine from Beaumont.

436
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,219
Get him out of here.

437
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:57,463
You know I can't do that, Jen.

438
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,166
I already told him he could stay.

439
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:00,929
It'd be impolite.

440
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Here.

441
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:12,679
What's this?

442
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,459
It's $500.

443
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:16,532
It's all I could get out
of the cash machine.

444
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,659
I'll get you another
500 in the morning.

445
00:26:28,246 --> 00:26:29,896
You think you're smart,

446
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:33,393
and the whole world's stupid.

447
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,927
That's just not how it is, Jen.

448
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,803
I don't think you're stupid.

449
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,932
No? But you think
you can buy me off with $1,000?

450
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
I'm not trying to buy you off.

451
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:47,092
What do you want from me?

452
00:26:47,217 --> 00:26:48,734
You know what I want?

453
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,485
What I really want is for you
to stop treating me like a dumbass,

454
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:55,655
19-year-old stickup artist
with a fast car!

455
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,740
You're not the only one
who's grown up.

456
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:01,845
Easy, Kevin, easy.

457
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:06,704
I've been waiting for this moment.

458
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,177
Dreaming about it.

459
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,138
You owe me.

460
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:18,295
If you think that I testified
against you, I didn't.

461
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:23,683
Don't lie to me!

462
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,393
I'm not lying to you!

463
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:28,803
I got out of jail before you did,
only because I went in as a minor.

464
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:30,022
No other reason.

465
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:35,569
The truth is,

466
00:27:37,543 --> 00:27:39,991
it doesn't change things,
one way or another.

467
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,701
See, I've done my homework.

468
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:43,807
I know what your job is.

469
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,164
I'm a data analyst, nothing more.

470
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:49,583
Yeah,
but you're a data analyst for CTU.

471
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:52,672
You got access to all sorts
of good stuff...

472
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,424
Bank codes,
port authority manifests,

473
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,910
stock exchange.

474
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:00,685
Access, yeah,
but not unrestricted access.

475
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,823
You'll figure something out.

476
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,223
You always do.

477
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:06,100
But whatever it is,

478
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,847
the payout's got to be
at least six figures, okay?

479
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:22,461
Please, Kevin.

480
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,637
Here's the deal.

481
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:37,287
You do this one thing for me,

482
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,908
and I'm gone.

483
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:43,021
I'll never bother you again.

484
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:46,841
I can't.

485
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:56,889
You can.

486
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,990
And you will.

487
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:07,302
We've been living
and operating out of a hotel

488
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:09,538
called Bella Noche
on avenida Juarez.

489
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,749
- Can't they check that?
- <i>It's a safe haven</i>

490
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,144
for high-end criminal activity.
They don't keep records.

491
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:17,380
- Have you got the name?
- Bella Noche. I got it.

492
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,984
I'm going to be monitoring you,
filling in the details.

493
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,927
Listen to my voice. I'll get you
all the information you need.

494
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,460
He's coming.

495
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,708
Come on. Let's go.

496
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,980
It's not pretty.
She had a problem on her hands.

497
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,043
Talk to me.

498
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,293
According to the responsible agent,
Vladimir Laitanan was obsessed with her.

499
00:29:58,418 --> 00:29:59,547
It turned violent.

500
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,794
- How violent?
- Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone.

501
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:04,676
Two trips to the emergency room.

502
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:05,845
Did he rape her?

503
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,391
Not according to these files,
but he tried a couple of times.

504
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:13,188
Did she say anything about this
to you or Hastings?

505
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,689
What's this about, Jack?

506
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:23,266
The FBI tried to cover this up
as much as they could.

507
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:26,333
But after she left the Bureau,
Renee went into a tailspin.

508
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,149
She tried to kill herself
at least once that I know about.

509
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,371
She says she's past it, but she's not.
I can see it in her eyes.

510
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,648
You think
she's putting herself in harm's way?

511
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,082
<i>I don't think she cares
what happens to her either way.</i>

512
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:39,272
- <i>Where is she now?
</i>- She's going in.

513
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:41,099
I'm going to put you on speaker.

514
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:50,044
Hands up.

515
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,616
Turn around.

516
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:03,647
Go.

517
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,371
Hello, Vlad.

518
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,669
You changed your face.

519
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,814
I had it done in Caracas.

520
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,218
What do you think?

521
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,342
Makes you look younger.

522
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,135
<i>I should get
the name of that doctor.</i>

523
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:30,500
He's not practicing anymore.

524
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,725
A sad story.

525
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:36,185
Our little friend here says
you were in Mexico City.

526
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,623
For what?

527
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,339
Had some business.

528
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,357
Good.
I've some contacts there myself.

529
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:42,765
I know you do.

530
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,488
Give me names.

531
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,754
The Peralta-Rodriguez family.

532
00:31:57,403 --> 00:31:59,166
The Peralta-Rodriguez family.

533
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:01,675
Castorenas in Guadalajara.

534
00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:03,963
- Ramon Jimenez.
- I know Ramon.

535
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,463
Is his brother Luiz
still running their heroin operations?

536
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,105
<i>He was killed nine months ago
by the federales.</i>

537
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,465
Not since he was killed
by the federales nine months ago.

538
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,739
You know, Renee,

539
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,742
now that you mention it,

540
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:20,902
there is something different
about you too.

541
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,524
How do you mean?

542
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:27,361
Your eyes.

543
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,156
Your skin.

544
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,575
You look like hell.

545
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,995
Well, it's hard to look your best
with a gun in your face.

546
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,150
No, that's not it.

547
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:44,876
Something else.

548
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:47,765
Have you been sick?

549
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:53,379
Maybe...

550
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:57,733
you picked up a little hepatitis C
on your travels?

551
00:32:58,814 --> 00:33:00,978
Where were you staying
in Mexico City?

552
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:02,625
The Bella.

553
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:04,526
Bella Noche hotel.

554
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,525
Bella Noche, naturally.

555
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,819
You must know
the government official who allows it

556
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,821
to operate
without police interference.

557
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,563
The hotel in Mexico City,
was there a politician on the take?

558
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:15,366
- I don't have it.
- Neither do I.

559
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:17,536
- Checking DEA database.
- Come on.

560
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,082
- Give me a minute.
- She doesn't have a minute.

561
00:33:23,454 --> 00:33:24,947
Waiting for a name!

562
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,118
Go ahead, tell him.

563
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:31,383
Really getting tired of this, Vlad.

564
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,709
His name!

565
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:35,664
Got it...
Raul Castillo.

566
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:37,514
Castillo, Raul Castillo.

567
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:43,606
Raul Castillo, all right?

568
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:46,911
Are we done
playing 20 questions now?

569
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,864
Yes, I believe we are.

570
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:01,966
You know, I had almost forgotten
how much fun you are.

571
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:03,703
You're not like other women.

572
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:05,314
You have balls.

573
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:08,610
You always did say
the nicest things.

574
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,513
Can we talk about this deal now?

575
00:34:13,562 --> 00:34:15,886
I wish it were that simple.
Tie her up.

576
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:17,721
What?

577
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,599
What are you doing?

578
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,628
You're not telling the truth.

579
00:34:22,753 --> 00:34:25,813
You're making a mistake.
This is the chance of a lifetime.

580
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:26,981
Him, too.

581
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:28,899
Vlad, wait.

582
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:31,247
Put them in the trunk.

583
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,248
Please don't do this!
Listen to me!

584
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:40,438
She come to me!

585
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:43,163
She come to my place, the bitch!
I swear!

586
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,276
I don't know anything about this!

587
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:51,423
What's happened?

588
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:54,625
They put her in the trunk,
I lost audio.

589
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,313
Boosting the signal now.

590
00:34:57,069 --> 00:34:58,188
Try it again.

591
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,881
Renee, can you hear me?
Say something.

592
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,291
- I don't have her.
- <i>The car must be armored.</i>

593
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,227
<i>Either that or her comm shorted out.</i>

594
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:10,357
Are you seeing this?

595
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:13,402
I am.

596
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:31,312
I'm following north
through an alley towards woodward.

597
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:33,130
I think this operation just blew up.

598
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,048
Are you planning to intercept?

599
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,384
The car is armored.
I'll need tactical support.

600
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,762
I'm alerting Hastings
to scramble a team now.

601
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,449
<i>Tell him I see four men in the car,</i>

602
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,585
we're going to have to assume
they'll kill her.

603
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,674
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Damn it!

604
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,062
<i>Don't work too late, hon.
Call me when you're on the road.</i>

605
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:58,187
Will do.

606
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:00,449
Dr. Levine.

607
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:02,268
How did you get in here?

608
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:04,203
My brother is sick.

609
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,163
I'm not seeing patients right now.

610
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,507
He needs your help.

611
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,916
I'll call an ambulance.

612
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:11,876
No one else can know about this.

613
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,382
My men are outside your house
in New Rochelle.

614
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:20,219
I don't believe you.
I just spoke to my wife.

615
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,757
We're outside the gate.

616
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:23,847
The address is 1614 Brook Street.

617
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:27,351
The light in your daughter's room
went out about ten minutes ago,

618
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,770
so I want you to put the phone down

619
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:32,314
you're not going to try
to warn anybody about this.

620
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:33,982
Do you understand?

621
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:36,087
I understand.

622
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:42,304
My brother has radiation poisoning.

623
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,284
He needs treatment.

624
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:46,643
His symptoms seem quite advanced.

625
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:50,009
I'm not sure what it is,
I can do for him.

626
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:51,875
You'd better be able
to do something,

627
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:53,534
for your family's sake.

628
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:59,258
I need to know what kind of materials
he came in contact with.

629
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:00,634
It was uranium.

630
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,427
Do you know what isotope?

631
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,995
Weapons-grade 235.

632
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:18,443
Jack, this is Hastings.
Tac teams are three minutes away.

633
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,612
All of them aware
that Renee is in the trunk?

634
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,830
The instructions are
to engage only on my command.

635
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:26,159
Any indication
where they're taking her?

636
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,245
Any percentage
in letting this play out?

637
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:31,790
As soon as she's out of the vehicle,
she becomes more vulnerable.

638
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,093
If we engage now,
it means ending the operation.

639
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,753
This operation's over.
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

640
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:39,298
Target just turned south
on flushing.

641
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:42,968
Jack, that's a feeder
onto the BQE in 2.6 miles.

642
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,052
If we don't engage
on these surface streets,

643
00:37:45,177 --> 00:37:46,680
we lose our tactical advantage.

644
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,307
Chloe, get me an ETA.

645
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,865
Intercept in...

646
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,310
Two minutes, ten seconds.

647
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,391
Sir, you need to make the call now.

648
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:56,273
All right,
I'm authorizing engagement.

649
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,164
Stand by for intercept protocols.

650
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:02,327
This is good.
Pull over.

651
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:21,628
Open it.

652
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:28,136
- Take them out of the trunk.
- Lugo, please, you tell Vladimir...

653
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:29,628
I've got a signal again.

654
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,066
Something's wrong...
They sound stopped,

655
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:35,729
but the vehicle I'm following
is going south on flushing.

656
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,893
- She told me to come to you!
- Shut up.

657
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:39,274
It won't do any good.

658
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:41,777
Confirming that,
the target is still moving.

659
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:44,729
A decoy.
They must have left in another vehicle.

660
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:45,656
Find it!

661
00:38:45,997 --> 00:38:47,683
Pulling up a satellite footage.

662
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:50,855
All right, tac teams,
hold your positions, stand by.

663
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:52,813
Another car drove out

664
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:54,957
of the building
five minutes after the first one.

665
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,248
Are you kidding me?

666
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:59,795
- Sorry, we were focusing on the follow.
- Just tell me where they are!

667
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,932
Take them down to the water.

668
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,375
I've got a GPS lock on Renee.

669
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,220
They're pulled off at Newtown Creek,

670
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,363
just south of Bryne Memorial Bridge.

671
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,247
- The tac teams?
-<i> I'm redirecting them.</i>

672
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:30,062
- How far out?
- Ten minutes.

673
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:32,828
Tell them to move it.
Put me back on to Renee's comm. Damn it!

674
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,390
I know you can hear me.
Vladimir had us following a decoy.

675
00:39:40,515 --> 00:39:42,998
<i>Tac teams are ten minutes out.
I'm on my way now.</i>

676
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:44,971
<i>Do whatever you have to to buy time.</i>

677
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,061
On your knees, both of you.

678
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,686
Please listen to me,

679
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:53,309
- I don't know anything.
- Shut your mouth.

680
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,683
I'm going to give you
one last chance to tell me...

681
00:39:58,808 --> 00:39:59,944
what is going on.

682
00:40:03,015 --> 00:40:04,637
I swear on my life,

683
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,230
she come to my place.
I don't know anything.

684
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:15,873
Amazing.

685
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:18,720
You didn't even blink.

686
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:32,057
Go ahead.

687
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,222
Just get it over with.

688
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,622
Renee, what the hell are you doing?

689
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:38,562
Not yet.

690
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,981
For God's sake, don't make me grovel.
Pull the damn trigger.

691
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:47,444
First I want to hear the truth.
I want to know who you really are.

692
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:52,657
Who I really am?

693
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,018
Who you are, not a game, Renee...

694
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,163
Or whatever your name is.

695
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:01,034
Fine, you want the truth?

696
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:04,358
I'll tell you the truth.

697
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,173
You were right.

698
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,237
You were right, I am sick.

699
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:14,221
I am so sick of living like this.

700
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:18,623
The truth is...

701
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,816
Even if you let me walk right now...

702
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:27,047
<i>I have nowhere to go
and no one to go to.</i>

703
00:41:33,987 --> 00:41:35,659
You don't want to do this deal,

704
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:37,473
fine.

705
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:40,517
Then you might as well kill me

706
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:43,592
because this deal
is the only thing that I have.

707
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:47,108
Renee, please don't do this, please.

708
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:51,147
Besides, you wouldn't be doing anything
that I haven't already tried myself.

709
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:56,623
Do it.

710
00:41:58,121 --> 00:41:58,890
Do it!

711
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:01,512
Pull the trigger!

712
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:17,161
I had to be sure.

713
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,720
You understand, right?

714
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:27,561
Good.

715
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:34,150
Dump him in the river.

716
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:50,745
<i>Tac teams are almost there.
I need a status update.</i>

717
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:56,495
<i>Jack, are you there?
Do you copy?</i>

718
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:58,909
You tell the tac teams
to stand down.

719
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,377
What's going on?

720
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:01,996
She's in.

721
00:43:02,435 --> 00:43:04,035
They bought her cover.
