3
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,851
Let's get cleaned up
before we head back to CTU.

4
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,812
I'm trying to locate an individual
by the name

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,265
<i>of Kevin Wade.</i>

6
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:26,566
Kevin's probation officer
just called me.

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,194
<i>He has records that show him</i>

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,987
calling my cell several times.

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,364
You have to handle this.

10
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:33,115
I don't know if I can do this.

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,159
Lie.
We both know you're good at it.

12
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,828
Put your hands where I can see them!

13
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:39,193
Do not move!

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,957
Marcos is out of the chamber.

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,960
Hang up and transmit the fail safe!

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,879
What's happening?

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,798
I don't know
if I could do this in time.

18
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,918
How will they smuggle the rods
into the city past the detectors?

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,294
Damn it, give me a name!

20
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:57,348
President Hassan's head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

21
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,688
Call U.N. security

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,607
and have them take Mr. Faroush
into custody until we get there.

23
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,309
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

24
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,069
Somewhere with my daughter.

25
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:12,989
Tarin is working
with your father's enemies.

26
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,141
<i>You must tell me where you are.</i>

27
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:17,410
The Teodore Hotel,

28
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,637
suite 514.

29
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,706
Just stay where you are.
The police will be there shortly.

30
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,501
We agreed
you weren't gonna take her calls.

31
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm sorry,
I just didn't want her to worry.

32
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:31,007
- Did you tell her where we are?
- Of course not.

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,311
We're arriving at the landing now.

34
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:38,068
Soon we'll be able to transport
the rods into Manhattan.

35
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:41,267
- Are CTU's radiation sensors down?
<i>- Not yet,</i>

36
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,643
but we'll be ready.

37
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,199
Listen up!

38
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:01,750
This is what we know.

39
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,999
IRK nationalists are targeting
New York with a dirty bomb.

40
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,266
We have one lead:

41
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,069
Hassan's former head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

42
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:12,006
We believe he wants
to disable our defenses

43
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,000
so they can smuggle the bomb
into Manhattan.

44
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,382
Latest intel is that Tarin
is staying at the Teodore hotel

45
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:19,163
with president Hassan's daughter.

46
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:22,224
Kayla has been warned by her mother
that he's with the terrorists.

47
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,218
She'll be trying to keep him
at the hotel until our tac teams arrive.

48
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:26,659
What's our ETA on that?

49
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:29,440
NYPD is approaching the staging area,
CTU still ten minutes out.

50
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:32,804
Chloe, you liaise with NYPD.

51
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:36,584
Actually, Dana is better
at the inter-agency protocols than I am.

52
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:38,983
Fine.

53
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,421
Jack Bauer's heading field ops,

54
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:45,124
Dana's on point with NYPD,
Arlo will run aerial.

55
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,207
Let's get to it.

56
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:54,052
All the changes
going on around here,

57
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,300
who do I report to exactly,
you or Dana?

58
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:57,884
What does it matter?

59
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,638
- I just like to be clear.
- The only thing you need

60
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,666
to be clear about is that there's a bomb
about to go off in Manhattan,

61
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,975
so just do your job.

62
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,829
Drone's in position
over the Teodore hotel

63
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:11,804
awaiting your instructions.

64
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,861
Kayla, we have to go.

65
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:40,167
Nearly ready.

66
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,102
Are you all right?

67
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,192
It was nothing, I'm fine.

68
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,751
The Americans got Marcos to talk.

69
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:15,062
He may have compromised you.

70
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:17,090
Did the girl
receive any phone calls?

71
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,369
- One... Her mother.
- Get out now.

72
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:21,865
And bring her with you.
We're moving to the next phase.

73
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,430
- I'll need a vehicle.
- Hamid is on his way.

74
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,920
We must go now.

75
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,831
Just one more minute.

76
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:38,915
Hurry up, please.

77
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:51,252
<i>I'm uploading Tarin Faroush's file
to you now.</i>

78
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:52,377
Copy that.

79
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:56,786
We're gonna need hotel schematics
and access to their security systems.

80
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,289
Coming to you now.

81
00:04:58,414 --> 00:04:59,778
Target is in room 514.

82
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:02,609
Hotel security is standing by
to give NYPD access.

83
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,220
Jack, Brian Hastings.
What's your ETA?

84
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,678
8 minutes. Can you patch me through
to our point man at NYPD?

85
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,973
We're doing that now.
Name's... sergeant Amis.

86
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,341
Sergeant Amis, Dana Walsh, CTU.

87
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:16,470
Been waiting on you, Ms. Walsh.
We're in our staging area already.

88
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,525
- <i>Go ahead, Jack</i>.
- Sergeant Amis, Jack Bauer.

89
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,361
Our target, Tarin Faroush,
is in room 514.

90
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,263
<i>He has a female hostage,
Kayla Hassan.</i>

91
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,787
<i>She's the daughter
of president Hassan of the IRK.</i>

92
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:29,071
We'll handle him. We'll make sure
that girl doesn't come to any harm.

93
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,122
The priority is to take Tarin alive.
He's our only lead to a major threat

94
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,333
- <i>against New York.</i>
- Like I said, we'll handle him.

95
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,498
Don't underestimate this man.
He was Hassan's head of security.

96
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:38,853
He knows what he's doing.

97
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,268
I want your men to set up a perimeter
and wait for us.

98
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:44,802
We're monitoring hotel security.
We'll tell you if we've got any action.

99
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,870
My friend from the state department
is waiting for us! We must go now.

100
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,019
One more second.

101
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:26,093
What are you doing?!

102
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,636
Stop this.
We walk out now.

103
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,929
- No, I'm not going anywhere.
- Just move!

104
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,431
Where are you taking me?

105
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:34,291
Believe me, the last thing I want to do
is hurt you, but I will.

106
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,774
- Got movement on the fifth floor.
- Are you getting this, Jack?

107
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,975
Someone must've tipped him off.
Sergeant?

108
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,237
Yes, I know, target's on the move.
I'm going in.

109
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,517
We're five minutes out.
Hold your position.

110
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,731
<i>I'm on the ground, Mr. Bauer.
It's my call.</i>

111
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:52,955
No, it isn't, this is a CTU operation.
I am telling you to hold your position.

112
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,230
I'm going in.

113
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,249
Tarin's at the elevators.

114
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,094
- Lost picture on the fifth.
- Sergeant,

115
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,700
target has taken out
elevator security camera and is armed.

116
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,557
I am ordering you to stand down.

117
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,934
- I'm right on him.
- Sergeant, that was an order!

118
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,082
Sergeant Amis, can you hear me?

119
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,322
- Chloe, have you got anything!?
- Nothing.

120
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,388
<i>We have shots fired.</i>

121
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:54,362
<i>All NYPD units report status.</i>

122
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,324
<i>Repeat, report status.</i>

123
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,178
This is Faulkner.
I'm hit.

124
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,308
- Amis and Martin are down.
- Where's the target?

125
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:03,507
He's heading toward the fire escape
on the south side. He's got the girl.

126
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:06,288
ESU, this is agent Ortiz.
Cover the south fire escape now!

127
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,318
Medics, men down on the fifth floor.

128
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,727
- That doesn't make sense.
- What do you mean?

129
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:14,118
Tarin just took out three men.
He should be heading down the stairs.

130
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,079
Son of a bitch.
NYPD,

131
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,748
target is impersonating an officer.
He has the girl.

132
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,207
Fall back and cover all exits.
I repeat,

133
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:25,168
target is impersonating an officer.
Cover all exits!

134
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,137
- Chloe, do you see anything?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

135
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,931
<i>- Send us back the drone feed.
- Roger that.</i>

136
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,144
Drop the gun!

137
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,893
Put it down!
Drop it now!

138
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:43,730
Target's at the Allen Street exit.

139
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,774
<i>- He's got the girl.</i>
- We need that drone feed.

140
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,984
Coming through.

141
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,240
There's a cab pulling up.

142
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:52,136
Officer Bellow, behind you!

143
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,789
- They're heading for the cab.
<i>- All ESU,</i>

144
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,791
we have two officers down
in the alley.

145
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:04,717
He's moving to Allen Street.

146
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,129
- He's escaping in the yellow cab.
- Tracking the cab.

147
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,422
Go!

148
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,427
Advise all NYPD mobile units,
we cannot lose that vehicle.

149
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,176
- On it.
- Taxi's in the delancey underpass.

150
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:19,102
- I'm blind. Do we have traffic cams?
- Not in the underpass.

151
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:20,767
We're two blocks from delancey.

152
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,062
- Any sign of the cab?
- Still in the underpass.

153
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,523
He's less than half a click.
Where the hell are they?

154
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,865
NYPD mobile units, 90 seconds out.

155
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,909
Go left, go left right here!

156
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,719
There it is. I got the cab.

157
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,612
Driver!

158
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,638
I want you to slowly open your door!

159
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:14,475
Open the door now!

160
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,737
It's empty.

161
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:27,742
Backtrack drone footage. Trace
every vehicle that left the underpass.

162
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,713
Get NYPD to set roadblocks.
They were here less than 30 s ago!

163
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,650
Got it.

164
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,848
- We should join the sweep.
- No, they're gone.

165
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:36,135
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do, they're gone.

166
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,612
I'm gonna need a kidnap
and an electronic intercept package.

167
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,598
- Have it meet me back at the UN.
- Copy.

168
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,616
I need to talk to president Hassan.

169
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,271
That's who they're gonna contact next.
That's why they kidnapped his daughter.

170
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,128
Tarin just called.
He has the girl.

171
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,730
Hello.

172
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,973
<i>- Ahman.</i>
- Samir, where are the rods?

173
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,995
They're still outside the city.

174
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,860
We haven't disabled
the radiological detectors yet.

175
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,680
Then how will you
bring the rods to me?

176
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,074
It's been taken care of.

177
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,070
We've backtracked through drone
and traffic cam footage.

178
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:53,420
Nothing's come up yet.

179
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,952
- What's Bauer's status?
- He's two minutes from the UN.

180
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:58,304
An electronic intercept team
is en route to him.

181
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:59,987
- Keep me informed.
- Copy.

182
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,627
There's a Mr. Prady here to see you.
Says he spoke to you on the phone.

183
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:06,752
Thank you.

184
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:16,558
Would you mind covering for me
for a few minutes?

185
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,011
A pleasure.

186
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,258
It'll be quieter in here.

187
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:48,703
This is...

188
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,311
This is some impressive facility.

189
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,482
What...

190
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,526
What is it you do here?

191
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,660
Intelligence analyst.

192
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,155
We've got a major situation...

193
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,199
I won't take up much of your time.

194
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,818
It's 3:00 in the morning,
you're 2,000 miles from home.

195
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,837
You mind telling me
what's so urgent?

196
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:13,830
It's about the young man
I mentioned on the phone...

197
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,295
This is him.

198
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,307
You know him, don't you?

199
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:38,601
I should have been
honest with you on the phone.

200
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:42,848
I met Kevin...

201
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,451
- a couple days ago at a bar.
- Was there another man with him?

202
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,096
He was traveling
with an ex-con named Nick Coughlin.

203
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,159
Bad news.

204
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:55,784
Done time on robbery,
attempted murder.

205
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:02,478
I've never seen him.

206
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,214
So, what happened...

207
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,661
With you and Kevin?

208
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,381
We talked for a while.

209
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,404
I drank more than I should,

210
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:28,283
- and we ended up back in his van.
- You had sex with him.

211
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:34,080
Do you know where he is now?

212
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,785
I didn't see him again.

213
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:41,391
- The whole thing was a mistake.
- Why so?

214
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,197
Because I am getting married...

215
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:44,981
in a few weeks.

216
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,583
It was the pressure.
I don't know.

217
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:50,931
All the wedding plans.

218
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:53,988
I went out for a drink.
I didn't intend to...

219
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:57,764
Maybe I did. I don't know.

220
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:03,318
I don't know anything anymore.
But if my fiancé finds out,

221
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:06,363
- he will never forgive me.
- I'm not looking to ruin your life.

222
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:10,578
I just want to retrieve Kevin
before he gets in more trouble

223
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,503
than violating his parole.

224
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,125
I understand.
I hope that you find him.

225
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,732
Thing is, Miss Walsh,

226
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,180
I got a call a couple hours ago

227
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,776
from my NYPD friend, Tom Hardiman.

228
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,178
Seems like there was... a break-in

229
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,933
at a police evidence lockup.

230
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,558
Again, bad business.

231
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,769
Officer got beaten up, left in a coma,
but guess whose prints

232
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,052
were on the assault weapon?

233
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,775
That nasty sob, Nick Coughlin.

234
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,755
Now,

235
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,610
what I'm afraid of is...

236
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,321
where Nick is, Kevin is, too,

237
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,300
and I really need to find him.

238
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,154
Like I told you,
I only saw him the once.

239
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,129
I have no idea where he is.

240
00:15:57,744 --> 00:15:59,124
And you're sure about that?

241
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:05,046
We are in the middle
of a national security crisis.

242
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,164
I have to go back to my desk.

243
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,011
I'm sorry.
Perhaps, if I talk to your supervisor,

244
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,802
he could let you take
a few minutes off.

245
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:19,545
Or I could...

246
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:21,164
wait here,

247
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,452
stay out of your way
till you have some time.

248
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:26,771
Fine.

249
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,946
- You have to stay here, though.
- Of course.

250
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,131
I don't understand.

251
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:40,267
The Americans knew where Kayla was.
How did they lose her?

252
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,493
Before we blame them, remember...

253
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,085
It was our own people

254
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,798
who kidnapped Kayla,
not the Americans.

255
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,510
Mr. President, CTU is here.

256
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:56,681
I'm Jack Bauer.

257
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,574
You already know Cole Ortiz.

258
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,800
We deeply regret not being able
to find your daughter,

259
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,209
but I promise you,
we'll do everything to recover her.

260
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,857
How did you lose her?
How did that happen?

261
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,017
Tarin had been warned.
We arrived too late.

262
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:09,861
- It was your people...
- Please.

263
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:16,608
- What do they want with Kayla?
- We were hoping you could tell us, sir.

264
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,621
Faroush was your head of security,
so he knows everything you know.

265
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:22,205
He took your daughter
so he can leverage something from you.

266
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,574
Do you have any idea
what that could be?

267
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:25,710
I don't know.

268
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,502
We believe the kidnappers
will contact you directly.

269
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:32,586
We need to monitor your phones
so we can track their call.

270
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:34,302
Do what you need to do.
Just, please,

271
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,012
get our child back.

272
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,360
- Please.
- Thank you.

273
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:40,485
With me.

274
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:46,600
Set up tech here.

275
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,394
Tarin! Don't.

276
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:52,863
Please.

277
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:56,395
Don't.

278
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:58,977
Please.

279
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,810
Do what he says,
and you won't get hurt.

280
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,249
Who is he?

281
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:13,674
Another traitor?

282
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,729
The only traitor is your father.

283
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:27,535
Tie her up.

284
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:02,265
- Do you recognize the number?
- There isn't one.

285
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,308
A call

286
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,226
- <i>coming in on the mother's cell phone.</i>
- We're working on it.

287
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,738
Answer it.

288
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:11,304
Keep them on the phone
as long as possible.

289
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:15,862
<i>Your husband is a traitor
to the people of the republic.</i>

290
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,782
He alone has made our actions
necessary.

291
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,556
<i>He cannot be trusted.</i>

292
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,124
Where is my daughter?

293
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,204
I want to talk to her.

294
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,624
Whether you ever see her again
depends on

295
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,168
what your husband does right now.

296
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,386
<i>Put him on.</i>

297
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:34,047
- They want to talk to you.
- Give me the phone.

298
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,229
- We need to be hearing this.
- We're still working on it.

299
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,427
We've got it.
You should have audio.

300
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,082
This is president Hassan.
Who are you?

301
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:45,929
I'm a loyal servant of the republic
you are trying to destroy.

302
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,562
Now, shut up, Omar, and listen.

303
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,031
I want to talk to my daughter.

304
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,149
Let me tell you what I want.

305
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:55,318
File 33.

306
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:57,889
File 33.

307
00:19:59,452 --> 00:20:01,433
That is the price of your daughter.

308
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:02,826
I don't know what that is.

309
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,939
You had to say that.

310
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:06,162
Of course.

311
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,909
<i>You're a vain man,
concerned about appearances,</i>

312
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,961
<i>and the Americans are listening.</i>

313
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,058
But please...

314
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:19,384
Do not insult me
by saying this again.

315
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,178
I won't say anything
until I talk to my daughter.

316
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:23,628
Fine.

317
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,246
If that's what you want.

318
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,551
I'm sending you an IP address.

319
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:31,020
Give it to one of the people
listening in.

320
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,780
Got it.

321
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:53,668
Don't hurt her.
It's me you want.

322
00:20:58,704 --> 00:20:59,966
I told you what I want.

323
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,260
<i>File 33.</i>

324
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,721
I told you...
I don't know what that is.

325
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,189
Take me instead.

326
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,565
<i>You have 15 minutes.</i>

327
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,693
<i>No excuses, no stalling.
15 minutes or she dies here, like this,</i>

328
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:21,112
- <i>while you watch.</i>
- Stop it.

329
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:22,530
Stop it!

330
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,240
I'll find the file.

331
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,075
Whatever it is, I'll get it for you!

332
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,876
What is file 33?

333
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,985
Brian Hastings is on the line.

334
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,636
You know anything about this file?

335
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,070
No, but I'm with president Hassan.
I'll put you on speaker.

336
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:50,763
- Go ahead.
- Mr. President, this is Brian Hastings.

337
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:54,145
I have no intel on that file.
Can you tell me what this is?

338
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,566
They gave you 15 minutes.

339
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,515
If you want to see your daughter again,
you don't have time to waste.

340
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,241
Omar, what is this file?

341
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,375
Show them.

342
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:19,212
Show them!

343
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,038
I'll do anything for Kayla.

344
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,142
- I would give my own life.
- Then give them this file.

345
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,540
Put it up on the screen,
mirror it over to CTU.

346
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,801
Are you seeing this?

347
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,929
Yes, I am.

348
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,457
This file appears to contain
operational details of all US.

349
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:15,184
Anti-nuclear defenses.

350
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:19,439
- That's correct.
- And our radiological detection arrays.

351
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:22,443
This is highly classified
D.O.D. material.

352
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,496
I need to know how you got this.

353
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:25,971
How do you think?

354
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:30,816
For 20 years,
your nation has threatened mine

355
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:34,826
with everything from economic sanctions
to military attack.

356
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:39,625
We gathered intelligence
and found weaknesses in your defenses.

357
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:43,022
We did...

358
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,218
what any other country would do.

359
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,729
That file shows the fatal flaws
of our nuclear detection capabilities.

360
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:52,510
If the terrorists were to get that,

361
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,882
they could smuggle
the fuel rods into Manhattan.

362
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,352
Surely you understand,
we cannot let you do that.

363
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,688
- A lot of human lives are at stake.
- What of my daughter?

364
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,649
What of her life?

365
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,888
With all due respect, madam,

366
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:08,841
your family brought this threat
to my country.

367
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:11,304
We're doing the best we can.

368
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,077
- <i>You still on?</i>
- We all are.

369
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,146
We may have a lead
on the daughter's location.

370
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:20,792
Arlo isolated a subway noise
from the video feed cross-referencing it

371
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,080
with the train positions
as of this moment.

372
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:25,630
There aren't a lot of trains,
especially within the radius

373
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,115
- they could've traveled to.
- They were heading southeast.

374
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,968
They've got to be near the F train stop
by the Williamsburg bridge.

375
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,057
Cole and I will head down there now.
We'll bring TAC from here.

376
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,045
- You need a second team?
- Yes, everything you've got.

377
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,436
Have your men ready
in 5 minutes. Right away.

378
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,648
- We're going to need you to stall them.
- How?

379
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,483
We'll set up a fake file.

380
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,151
They'll see through that.

381
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,932
Right now we need you to stall them
long enough to locate your daughter.

382
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,198
Any way you can,

383
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:54,909
- but make this work.
- We'll do whatever we have to.

384
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:57,891
Thank you.

385
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,331
- Please, don't...
- Why are you doing this?

386
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:45,603
- Why are you doing this?
- Please don't say anything more.

387
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:11,611
- Is there trouble?
- Why would there be?

388
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,531
What's the problem?

389
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,774
They'll never hand over that file.

390
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:19,600
- They have to.
- If they don't?

391
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:22,371
- Killing her was not part of the plan.
- You were willing to die

392
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,436
in Hassan's limousine earlier today.

393
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:26,751
- To do anything for our cause.
- I still am.

394
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,923
You assured me your feelings for her
would not get in the way.

395
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:35,154
So tell me,

396
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,094
do I need someone else?

397
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:47,146
Stay strong.

398
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:50,904
We're almost there.

399
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,895
What's the status
on our target area?

400
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,204
Still looking
at almost six square blocks.

401
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:24,308
- How far out are Jack and Cole?
- Six minutes.

402
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,937
We've got 30 seconds to find her
and to narrow this down.

403
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,231
- Where's the second TAC team?
- Leaving now.

404
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,336
Who is that?

405
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:40,652
Nobody.

406
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:47,748
This is a secure area.
Wait in holding or you have to leave.

407
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:49,925
I'm sorry.
I had a question.

408
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,503
I'm in the middle of a situation.
I don't have time.

409
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:55,527
I just got off the phone
with my NYPD friend.

410
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:58,749
He said I have to ask you
about the security cameras

411
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:00,261
at the police evidence lockup.

412
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,762
Because you know what?

413
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,124
It turns out

414
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,058
they malfunctioned
for the exact duration of the incident.

415
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,085
Somebody obviously
disabled the cameras.

416
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:10,771
But not Nick and Kevin.

417
00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:13,941
A crowbar is about as high-tech
as those two get.

418
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:17,278
That's what I wanted to talk to you.
See, I'm thinking

419
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:19,947
that someone must have helped them.

420
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:29,898
Now, my friend says
that all the raw video

421
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,669
from every government facility
feeds right here into CTU.

422
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:35,338
That right?

423
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:37,298
- Yes.
- He also said...

424
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:39,496
Correct me if I'm wrong...

425
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,432
That the digital images are archived
every eight hours,

426
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,221
and metadata...
Is that what it's called?

427
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:48,851
That allows you to trace

428
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,448
the exact source
of any service outage.

429
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:56,510
Everything I need to solve this
is right here.

430
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,402
You can get it for me, right?

431
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:01,530
We don't just give data
to people off the street.

432
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,108
Now, that's right.

433
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,389
You need, an IDRAN...

434
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,561
An interagency data request

435
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:11,836
authorization number.
Hardiman gave me one of those.

436
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:14,877
He said everything should fit

437
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,831
on a 100-gig thumb drive.

438
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,467
So is that going to be a problem,
getting that for me?

439
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:30,142
Good.

440
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:39,156
They reprocessed the subway noise,
managed to narrow down the grid.

441
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:41,242
- How big?
- About 12 buildings total.

442
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:42,863
Apartments, offices, retail.

443
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,876
It's still too much ground to cover.

444
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,417
It's over.

445
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,617
I'm not sure I heard you.

446
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,237
The parole officer looking for Kevin
is here at CTU.

447
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:02,362
Knows about the robbery,
the cameras, everything.

448
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,634
Are you sure?

449
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:09,162
He's after the raw feeds.

450
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:11,906
He's got an interagency request.

451
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,356
I'm going to give it to him.

452
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:21,368
I'm sorry to call you.
I just thought that you should know.

453
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:23,482
- Why don't you wait?
- Do you hear me?

454
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,656
He knows.
He'll go to Hastings.

455
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:29,287
Don't do anything.
We'll talk about it when I get back.

456
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:30,931
<i>I can't wait.</i>

457
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:35,256
You'll get in more trouble
trying to protect me.

458
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:39,795
I can't let that happen.

459
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:45,072
I love you, Cole.

460
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,939
You got a problem?

461
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:54,018
'cause I need you
to keep your head in this.

462
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,181
You got it.

463
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,587
We're running out of time.

464
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:07,362
The technicians have...

465
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:09,491
prepared the file I'll be sending.

466
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,220
But these people who have Kayla...

467
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,789
They won't believe a fake file.

468
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:18,345
But they might believe you.

469
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,589
You have a gift, Omar.
When you talk, people listen.

470
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:26,519
You need to convince them,
for our daughter.

471
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,094
Say whatever you need to
to buy time.

472
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:35,935
I have seen you move so many people.

473
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,897
You can do this.
I know it.

474
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:46,255
I'm sorry.

475
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,823
It's time.

476
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,468
It's the deadline.

477
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:11,554
Your father has not responded.

478
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,367
You hate him that much,
you would do this to me?

479
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:22,106
I don't want to die.

480
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,951
Please.

481
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,141
Then let us pray for once your father
does the right thing.

482
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,088
Tarin, you can't let them do this.

483
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:41,445
I know you.

484
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,493
This is not you.

485
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:46,742
And I know in my heart
that you love me.

486
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:48,955
In my heart I know.

487
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,736
And so I don't understand why...

488
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:56,347
Nearly there, sir.

489
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:02,661
The uplink's ready.

490
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,370
Let's go.

491
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,075
Stop them!

492
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,255
Wait.

493
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,176
Follow me.

494
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:37,473
This way.

495
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:39,692
My father will help us.

496
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,293
He's surrounded by traitors.
We have to get to CTU.

497
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,363
Here, the number is in this cell phone.
Call them.

498
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,368
What has happened to her?
Did the Americans stop the call?

499
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:40,369
I don't know.

500
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,033
Maybe they were afraid
we'd hand over the real file.

501
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:46,304
They could have gotten
our daughter killed.

502
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,909
Why aren't we seeing anything?

503
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:59,237
We're not sure.
Arlo's been scanning the source.

504
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:00,931
Four minutes ago there was a spike.

505
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,158
- Like a gunshot.
- Did Jack hear anything?

506
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:05,144
He's still a quarter of a mile out.

507
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,183
You better take this.
Kayla Hassan,

508
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:09,189
- she's in a car, she's escaped.
- What?

509
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,985
Brian Hastings, director of CTU.

510
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,595
<i>- You all right?</i>
- I'm not all right.

511
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,820
I'm driving.

512
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:18,847
They might be chasing me,
I don't know.

513
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:21,251
- Where are you?
- I don't know!

514
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:23,347
Track her cell phone, patch Jack in.

515
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:25,908
We're tracking your phone.
Do not turn it off.

516
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:28,325
- Just tell us what happened.
- They tried to kill me,

517
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,908
but Tarin got me out.

518
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:33,130
He found a car, but they caught us.
They shot him.

519
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:34,798
He's dead.

520
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:37,384
<i>He told me to call CTU,</i>

521
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:39,722
<i>that it was the only safe place.</i>

522
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,346
My name is Jack Bauer.

523
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:43,502
<i>We need to know
where you were being held.</i>

524
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:44,558
I don't know.

525
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,643
I know you've been through
a great ordeal,

526
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:48,908
<i>but please, this is very important.</i>

527
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,409
<i>Can you try to remember
what the building looked like?</i>

528
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:53,901
It was dark, and it was empty.

529
00:35:55,374 --> 00:35:58,068
<i>It had a vault, like a bank,
but abandoned.</i>

530
00:35:58,193 --> 00:35:59,656
- Chloe, you get that?
- Got it.

531
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:03,410
You need to tell my father
that Tarin Faroush helped me escape,

532
00:36:04,486 --> 00:36:06,635
<i>that he sacrificed his life for me.</i>

533
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,831
<i>We've the location.</i>

534
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,970
Republic Commerce Bank,
9621 East Broadway.

535
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:13,783
It closed a year ago.
It's the only bank on the grid.

536
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:16,531
We'll need drone support,
and send a second team over.

537
00:36:16,656 --> 00:36:17,706
We got 'em.

538
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,095
We've got you
on First Avenue and East Fifth.

539
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,831
<i>Continue going straight,
I will tell you when to turn.</i>

540
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:40,595
Cover this exit.
Send the second team down.

541
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,097
Cole, you're with me.

542
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:43,518
Let's take the door.

543
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:02,095
Chloe, it's Jack.
We're in the basement of the bank.

544
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,021
There's some kind of tunnel system.

545
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:06,594
I've got the schematics,
I'm seeing it now.

546
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,657
We're going to head down a spur
southeast from the vault.

547
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:11,846
- How many exit points?
- Two exits...

548
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:12,969
No, three.

549
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,335
Have the drone cover
all the exit points.

550
00:38:16,984 --> 00:38:19,714
I'm sending you my screen now.
Can you get eyes on the exits?

551
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,465
Ascending to 5,000.

552
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,190
I got movement at the south exit.

553
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,581
I've got four hostiles
approaching Division Street on foot,

554
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,722
<i>heading northeast.
You copy?</i>

555
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:58,595
Cole, they double-backed up top.

556
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,763
We're moving to intercept.

557
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,048
Where's Kayla?

558
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,842
Approaching the tunnel entrance,
she'll be with us in two minutes.

559
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,539
Security is standing by.

560
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:09,012
Good work, people.

561
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,979
- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

562
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:21,775
If you'll excuse me
for a few minutes...

563
00:39:29,238 --> 00:39:31,182
Targets are heading north
on Orchard.

564
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:33,745
They're getting into an SUV.

565
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,013
<i>Do you copy?</i>

566
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,285
- Stay with them, we'll follow.
- Owen, King, you're coming with us.

567
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,961
You take King's vehicle,
you two double-back around Orchard.

568
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,880
I've got a shot
for facial recognition.

569
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,976
Send it to me.

570
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:55,017
It's Tarin Faroush.

571
00:39:56,648 --> 00:39:58,216
He's supposed to be dead.

572
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:00,091
Kayla said they shot him.

573
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:10,782
You did the right thing, Tarin.

574
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:13,827
I know.

575
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:16,747
She will die for a good cause.

576
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:26,652
<i>Jack, Cole, come in.</i>

577
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:27,674
Go ahead.

578
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,091
We ID'd one of the targets.
It's Tarin Faroush.

579
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:33,284
Kayla said he sacrificed himself
to save her, but he's still alive.

580
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,789
Are you absolutely sure?

581
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,060
What the hell's going on?

582
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,648
They wanted a file
they knew we would never give them.

583
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:42,022
They never expected us to.

584
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,525
- You got to put Hastings on now.
- I'm on, Jack.

585
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,425
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.
The terrorists faked her escape.

586
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,797
- They wanted to get her to CTU.
- For what purpose?

587
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:52,831
What's the best way to disarm
New York's radiological defenses?

588
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:55,328
Taking out CTU.
There must be something in the car,

589
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,475
some kind of a bomb.
You need to stop her now.

590
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,805
Where is she?

591
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:02,000
She's in the tunnel.

592
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,023
Security!

593
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:13,887
Dana, with me!

594
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,839
The car that Tarin got into,
where is it now?

595
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:18,704
Crossing into Brooklyn,

596
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:21,091
taking the first exit
off the Williamsburg Bridge.

597
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,542
<i>We cannot lose it,
do you understand me?</i>

598
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:24,773
Copy.

599
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:27,293
Stop the car!

600
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:30,821
Put your hands
where we can see them!

601
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,155
Dana, call the bomb squad!

602
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:35,479
Get out of the car!

603
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:37,744
Take her.

604
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,955
Bomb squad to the tunnel entrance.

605
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:44,835
- Get her away.
- Have you stopped that car?

606
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,390
Not in time, Jack.
Hold on, just hold on.

607
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,190
It's an EMP.

608
00:41:50,782 --> 00:41:51,842
It's an EMP!

609
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,997
Shut down your systems
to protect the drones.

610
00:41:54,122 --> 00:41:55,178
There's no time.

611
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,808
- Get away from the car!
- I can move it.

612
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,776
Come on, get out of there!

613
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,188
Get out of there!

614
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,698
Can you hear me?

615
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:18,916
Those drones are our only way
of tracking down those terrorists.

616
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,787
You need to pass them off
to the NSA.

617
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,334
Damn it, we're blind.
Chloe, did you cop...

618
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:28,789
What the hell is happening?

619
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:30,564
We need to contact NSA.

620
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:32,800
The terrorists just took out CTU.
