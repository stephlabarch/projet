1
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,570
Previously on 24

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,200
What the hell is this?!

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,100
All our screens for the eastern quadrant are locked.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,680
I took out your control units.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,710
I want you to see what we can do.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,960
Get ready to make the course change

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,400
Gsa 117, this is northeast three control.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,900
Go ahead, air traffic control.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,980
We have a new runway assignment for you.

10
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,370
Sid, there's another plane landing on four-right.

11
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:33,595
It crosses three-one-left.

12
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:35,197
Gsa 117, pull up.

13
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:36,863
Four-right, pull up.

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,563
That was just a warning shot.

15
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:42,782
Whatever we do next

16
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:43,961
It'll be the real thing.

17
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:45,220
Get the module ready.

18
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:47,712
As promised.

19
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,102
General juma will be pleased.

20
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:53,480
Perhaps now would be a good time

21
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,203
to make your demands known to president taylor.

22
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:56,470
Make the preparations.

23
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,860
Your government is about to pay a very steep price for...

24
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:01,343
...interfering in our affairs.

25
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:03,873
They assumed my son killed himself

26
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,540
They didn't look deeply enough into anything.

27
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,020
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.

28
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:11,153
You're not going anywhere till I get the truth.

29
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:13,453
You know who murdered my son.

30
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:15,281
He killed himself

31
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:16,951
I'm gonna find what you are hiding.

32
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:19,480
When I do, God helf you.

33
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,111
You're right. he's not one of ours.

34
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,223
We'll follow him, see if he leads us back to almeida-- dornan.

35
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:25,801
No, that's not the right move.

36
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:28,602
You can't bring anyone else into this,

37
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,181
What the hell's going on?

38
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:31,791
We're following up on a lead.

39
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,461
And I will fill you in if and when we find something.

40
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,491
I do not like this.

41
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:36,993
I just flat out lied to my boss.

42
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:38,523
I told you I'd help you find Tony Almeida.

43
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,113
But you're going to have to let me do it my way.

44
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:44,082
Tony, stop.

45
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:52,691
Device is gone.

46
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,320
The locator files have been deleted.

47
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:55,812
Where is it?!

48
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,852
What the hell happened to you?


50
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:12,790
Where is almeida now?

51
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:14,611
He is in transit to FBI headquarters

52
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,312
He'll be formally interrogated there.

53
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:19,562
I don't understand. Almeida was orchestrating this attack.

54
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:21,940
If he doesn't have the CIP device, who does?

55
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:24,732
The FBI has learned that Almeida haned off the device

56
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:26,723
to someone else,we don't know who.

57
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:29,251
I may have answer to that question, madam president.

58
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:30,783
I'm listening.

59
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,043
He's working with the Juma regime.

60
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:35,361
Approximately 5 minutes ago,

61
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:37,260
an audio message was routed to the State Department's subnet.

62
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,593
It's from Colonel Dubaku

63
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,140
He's Juma's right-hand man.

64
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:42,520
He's known as the butcher in Sangala.

65
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,512
Over three hundred thousand people were murdered.

66
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:46,110
I know who he is.

67
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:48,553
What did the message say?

68
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,031
You should hear it yourself.

69
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:53,971
President Taylor

70
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:56,360
This is Colonel Ike Dubaku.

71
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:00,501
As you have no doubt confirmed,

72
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:03,413
the near-collison at JFK international was no accident

73
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,711
We have the CIP device.

74
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:13,042
We have the capability to kill tens of thousansds of Americans.

75
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,420
And we are prepared to do so.

76
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,940
We demand the complete and immediate withdrawal

77
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:21,233
of the US naval strike force

78
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:25,803
to a position west of 23rd meridian by this time tommorrow.

79
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:29,873
In order to meet this timeline

80
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:33,891
We require a satellite confirmation within three hours.

81
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:37,990
that the Carrier Air Wing is in full retreat.

82
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:43,481
Don't sacrifice your fellow countryman.

83
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:45,602
Madam president

84
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:50,700
Allow the people of Sangala to determine their own destiny.

85
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:54,440
Stand your forces down.

86
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,931
Voice prints an 89% match.

87
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:59,140
It's Dubaku. There's little doubt.

88
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:01,691
Looks like your suspicion were correct, madam president.

89
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:03,450
This is about Africa.

90
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:07,332
My god. Dubaku should have been tried for war crimes years ago.

91
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,011
Now he's giving us ultimatums.

92
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:13,720
We can not let this monster hold our country hostage.

93
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:14,970
Where do we stand on the planes?

94
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:16,771
They're still 2500 planes in the air

95
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,100
We have got to shore up the firewall

96
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,241
so that the CIP device will be rendered useless.

97
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,910
We now think we can re-engineer the code in six days.

98
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,663
Six days? We don't have the luxury of six hours!

99
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,670
I'm sorry, madam president. But their is no way

100
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,501
we can rebuild the firewall in that timeframe.

101
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,110
I want you to instigate a series of restricted allerts.

102
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,152
Keep it to the first responders only.

103
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:43,262
I want people to be ready in case we are attacked again

104
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:45,052
but we don't wanna start panic

105
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:46,403
Yes, madam president

106
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,292
And gentlemen, Almeida is our only lead.

107
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:54,753
Make sure the FBI is aware of the demands

108
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,342
and they need to work Almeida from the Africa side

109
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:57,933
And they need to know we don't have a lot of time.

110
00:04:57,938 --> 00:04:59,011
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:26,732
Come on

112
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:31,453
Put your head down

113
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:47,591
Get him ready for questioning.

114
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,240
I want an explanation.

115
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:57,040
You went after that shooter without backup or authorization,

116
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:58,840
And then refused to tell me why.

117
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:00,071
Now i want to know

118
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:01,421
We didn't know who might be listening

119
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:04,272
Someone in this office is helping Almeida

120
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:05,440
What?

121
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,700
The FBI has been compromised, larry. there's a leak

122
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:10,822
Based on what? Excuse me!

123
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:11,902
This is private

124
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,842
Tony knew that we were going to Schector's office before we even got there

125
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:16,961
That's how he managed a sniper in position

126
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:21,700
The tip had to come from your office, whoever it was helped sheclter's assassinator got out of the building

127
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,602
He is right lerry, that's why we couldn't tell you

128
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,802
You've got a full perimeter, right?Covered every exit?

129
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,703
How else do you think he got out of there?

130
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,930
All right, assuming this is true, you got any idea who it could be?

131
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:36,890
No, we didn't see him, but we knew that it went down

132
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:38,651
Could be anyone in the bureau

133
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:41,273
You need tighten your circle around tony

134
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,972
You can't get any information that he gives you get back to the people he is working with

135
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,592
Other wise you will never get the CIP device

136
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:56,700
All right, I'll limit access the level 4 clearance above

137
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:01,053
Have Janis run the security protocols see if she can track down the leak

138
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,240
This's moss

139
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,863
Sir I have a white house call for you

140
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,582
-Yeah, I'll take it in my office -Yes

141
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:08,213
-Yea

142
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,183
It's the white house

143
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:18,330
From now on, keep me in the loop

144
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:21,655
And he doesn't do a damn thing without telling me

145
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:28,977
We had to tell him, We had no choice

146
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:31,773
You trust him?

147
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:34,253
No question, there is no one I trust more

148
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,450
Where they gonna hold tony?

149
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:44,673
Well, I'm gonna have to lift up your shirt

150
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,162
Is that comfortable for you?

151
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,200
I'll take that as a Yes

152
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,173
-Is he hooked up?-Yeah, we are ready to go

153
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:20,813
Janis, I'll run this session, I want you to handle something else

154
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:22,711
What else?

155
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,292
Plugging a security leak

156
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,050
What?

157
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,933
We think someone in this office has been helping Almeida

158
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:35,122
We've kicked this up to level four clearance.I want you to vet all communication and information flow.

159
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:38,080
Red-tag every data point that has to do with almeida.

160
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:40,073
Okay, do we have any idea who it is?

161
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:42,653
No, we don't. I'm hoping that you can help us find out

162
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:44,230
Okay

163
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:51,192
There's a point-two deviation on the blood pressure monitor, you are gonna have to compensate for that

164
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:52,653
Thanks,Janis

165
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,253
Sorry about your friend Jack.

166
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:14,351
I know you were hoping he wasn't capable of doing something like this.

167
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,782
Yea

168
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,480
Hey, what's going on, why are we in the level 4 lockdown?

169
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,842
Don't worry about that, just do your job

170
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:41,960
How am I supposed to do my job when i can't get through half the server nodes in the building

171
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:44,533
You're sifting through the evidence gathered at almeida's arrest site

172
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,933
That doesn't not require level 4 clearings

173
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,482
Get everything you need to do your work, PLEASE

174
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:01,462
Oui, je comprends

175
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:12,161
It's confirmed, the FBI has Almeida.

176
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,033
We should move on, there's nothing we can do.

177
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:19,541
We have assets inside the bureau, we use them, perhaps will get him out.

178
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:20,862
No, it's too risky.

179
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:22,480
We'd be jeopardizing the entire mission.

180
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:23,800
Almeida is just not that important.

181
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:24,992
What about the next operation?

182
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:26,420
Tony is prepped, he's ready to go.

183
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:27,741
We'll just gonna have to find someone else.

184
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:30,313
I realized you and Tony are friends.

185
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:32,902
I don't like throwing him to the wolves anymore than you do.

186
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,003
But he knew what he was getting into.

187
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,552
I just spoke with Juma

188
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,012
The American troops are still in position near our country.

189
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:42,971
Tell Juma to be patient,

190
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,171
President Taylor just received your demands.

191
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,891
Then perhaps this time for a more forceful demonstration.

192
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,782
If it comes to that, we will be ready.

193
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:53,952
For now, let's give the white house a little more time to respond.

194
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,771
For now.

195
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:12,803
Agent Walker.

196
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:18,983
Almeida is working for the Juma reign.

197
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:20,753
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,340
The president just received a set of demands.

199
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:24,343
They're from Colonel Ike Dubaku.

200
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,310
Dubaku?

201
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,713
Looks like he contracted Almeida to build the CIP module.

202
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:31,252
No, he's gonna blackmail the white house.

203
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,512
How?

204
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:35,473
Excuse me?

205
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:37,622
How is he gonna blackmail the white house?

206
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:41,910
By insisting we stand down the invasion force of the coast Sangala.

207
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:44,970
If the president doesn't comply with his demands,

208
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,572
Dubaku is gonna start killing americans.

209
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:51,070
I can get you the CIP device.

210
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,760
Just let me talk to him.

211
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:57,341
I know him, I might know how he thinks.

212
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:59,680
We have a history, I can use it to agaist him.

213
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:02,981
He's got us this far, Larry.

214
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:04,502
It makes sense.

215
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:09,120
You're running out of time.

216
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:10,881
You don't have a better option.

217
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,260
Give us the room.

218
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:51,512
I watched you die in my arms.

219
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:55,423
You wanna explain to me why you're still alive?

220
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:02,531
Didn't think so.

221
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,011
Why don't I tell you what I know.

222
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,701
I know that you're working for Juma regime.

223
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,172
The white house just got their demands.

224
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:13,772
And you have to know that I will never let that happen.

225
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:19,282
Why don't you save yourself some time.

226
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:26,750
and some pain and tell me what CIP device is.

227
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,232
I can't tell you that, Jack.

228
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:34,070
Tony, you're not just facing charges of domestic terrorism,

229
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:36,170
you were gonna face international charges

230
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:38,011
for aiding and abetting a genocide,

231
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:40,121
They will give you the death penalty.

232
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:43,110
Come on, just work with me on this.

233
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,433
I can help you cut a deal, I can maybe even get you an immunity.

234
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,052
You're wasting your breath, Jack.

235
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,850
If I were you, I would tell the president to withdraw those troops.

236
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:52,772
Because Dubaku is serious.

237
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,231
He's ready to take thousands of american lives

238
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:56,532
unless his demands are met.

239
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:57,980
Why the hell are you doing this?

240
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:02,462
Juma wanted the CIP module and he was brewing to pay for it.

241
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:09,732
I don't believe you.

242
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:11,723
Oh, come on, Jack.

243
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:13,593
Don't act so surprised.

244
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:17,682
Money is the only reason I have left doing anything.

245
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:20,471
The government took care of that.

246
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,162
The government did not kill Michelle.

247
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,463
Charles Logan did.

248
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:25,882
Charles Logan is the product of his enviroment.

249
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:28,920
The government poisons everything in his path.

250
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,591
But you know that better than me, Jack.

251
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:33,791
Look what they did to you.

252
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,753
Damn it, Tony, we're not talking about me.

253
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,483
Oh, we're not?

254
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:41,532
You're asking me why I'm doing this.

255
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:43,610
I could ask you the same question.

256
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,480
Here you are, working for the same people

257
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:46,481
who wanted to put you into the prison,

258
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,171
the same people who killed everything you love and left you with nothing,

259
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,612
your daughter wants nothing to do with you

260
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:53,610
Teri is dead,

261
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:54,210
Shut up.

262
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:55,022
Audrey Raines--

263
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:55,701
I said shut up.

264
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:56,911
No, Jack, no.

265
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,450
You need to hear this.

266
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:00,232
You need to start living in the real world!

267
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,190
Because every second you help the government

268
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:03,860
You're spitting on Teri's grave Enough! get up!

269
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:07,320
Get up!

270
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:09,531
He's losing it

271
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:10,800
where's the device?

272
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:12,411
Tell me where the device is!

273
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:15,203
So help me god, I will kill you.

274
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,842
And you will stay dead this time.

275
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,712
Where is the device?

276
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:23,862
last chance.

277
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,482
Where is it? Where is it?

278
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:34,650
Deep sky. Jack

279
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,690
What did you just say?

280
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:37,913
Son of a bitch.

281
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:38,942
Give him a few more seconds.

282
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,071
A few more seconds, he'll be dead.

283
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:41,970
Deep sky.

284
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:43,692
Jack. Let him go.

285
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:46,962
Get him out of here.

286
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,213
Get him out of here now.

287
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:54,902
I need a medic here to check him out. In here, please.

288
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:08,403
Keep an eye on him.

289
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:12,430
Deep sky.

290
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:22,242
Hello.

291
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:26,932
This is Jack Bauer.

292
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,211
Yes.

293
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:29,723
I was told to call you.

294
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,001
By whom?

295
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,422
Tony Almeida

296
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,071
He gave me this old CTU emergency phone code.

297
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:39,882
Deep sky.

298
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:45,662
It's Bill, Jack.

299
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,370
Bill, what the hell is going on?

300
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:49,512
Where is Tony?

301
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,522
FBI headquarters. He's been arrested.

302
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:53,160
Arrested?

303
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:56,040
He orchastrated the terrorist attack on United States today.

304
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:57,671
I was interrogating him.

305
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,633
How would you get involved in this?

306
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:02,692
The FBI brought me in to help track him down.

307
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,382
We need to talk, Jack.

308
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,180
I'll call you back on a secure VPN line.

309
00:17:07,248 --> 00:17:08,702
Bill, what the hell is going on?

310
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:10,261
I need 10 minutes to set up the vpn...

311
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:11,771
I don't have 10 minutes.

312
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,013
10 minutes, Jack.

313
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:21,651
I can't believe this.

314
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:25,322
If Tony's been arrested, it's over

315
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,771
Are you gonna tell Jack everything?

316
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,563
If we want to get Tony back under cover,

317
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,703
we will need his help.

318
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:32,180
I don't think Jack is in a very helpful frame of mind.

319
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:35,541
He's our only hope.

320
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:52,440
Hello, Henry

321
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,610
Ethan, I got your message about Sangala.

322
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:55,911
Where is Allison?

323
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,381
She's in her office.

324
00:17:58,258 --> 00:17:59,061
Henry.

325
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,863
The president is in an impossible situation right now.

326
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:08,671
She needs your support.

327
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,352
But you can't give it to her

328
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:14,342
if you keep going on this paranoid fantacies about Roger.

329
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:15,821
I know about Samantha Roth.

330
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,793
I know you accosted her in her office.

331
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,762
She's hiding something about my son's murder.

332
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:23,443
Roger wasn't murdered.

333
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:25,353
He committed suicide.

334
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:26,870
The coroner's office made that determination

335
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,570
and the FBI confirmed it.

336
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,392
They didn't look hard enough.

337
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,511
Ethan, I know my son.

338
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:35,601
He did not kill himself.

339
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,791
He wasn't depressed. He had no reason.

340
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:38,980
What if he did have a reason?

341
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:40,553
I would have known.

342
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,200
Not if he didn't tell you.

343
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,640
Not if he was too ashamed to tell you

344
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:45,830
or the president.

345
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,951
What are you talking about?

346
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,530
Roger was about to be investigated by the sec for insider trading.

347
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:56,833
He'd used information he only could have gotten through

348
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:58,433
his access to the president.

349
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:01,440
Before the sec opened the investigation,

350
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,742
he killed himself.

351
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:06,053
I don't believe it.

352
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,073
It's all in here.

353
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:12,113
In the sec case file.

354
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:14,823
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this?

355
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:18,081
Frank boylan agreed to bury the case.

356
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,503
As a political favor to the president.

357
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:23,452
My wife knew about this and she didn't tell me?

358
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,640
She wanted to.

359
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,653
But she also wanted to protect your memory of your son.

360
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:29,942
You were in so much pain.

361
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:32,102
Damn it, Ethan. He was my son. I deserve the truth.

362
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,491
And keeping it from you was a terrible mistake.

363
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,212
I realize that now.

364
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,000
But the president and I both thought you were

365
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,451
moving on with your life.

366
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,513
Mr. Kanin.

367
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,581
The president wants to see you.

368
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,091
Does she know you're telling me this now?

369
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:56,243
No. And I think it best we keep it that way,

370
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:59,561
at least till this crisis is resolved.

371
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:14,072
I feel I have to tell him, sir. I'm sorry.

372
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:24,021
Alright, thank you.

373
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:27,651
Madam president, you wanted to see me?

374
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:32,723
Admiral Smith laid out the timeline of withdrawing our forces.

375
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,422
He's saying to meet Dubaku's demands,

376
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:38,913
we need to order the pullback by 1 pm.

377
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,202
That's not much time.

378
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:42,580
No, it isn't.

379
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:47,272
Well maybe this Almeida will tell us where to find the CIP device.

380
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,341
No. Tim Woods just heard from the Bureau.

381
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,622
So far Almeida's refusing to cooperate.

382
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:54,703
Well maybe he's just positioning for a deal.

383
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:56,150
Tim doesn't think so.

384
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:58,691
He said we shouldn't count on Almeida to talk.

385
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,682
I see.

386
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:03,623
So

387
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:08,052
unless I order our forces to stand down.

388
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:13,060
I'll be condemning innocent Americans to death.

389
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:15,391
And if we capitulate,

390
00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:19,640
thousands of Sangalas will be slaughtered.

391
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:28,941
How did this happen, Ethan?

392
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:33,820
How could we been so caught off guard,

393
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:38,040
and now I have to decide between two impossible choices.

394
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:44,402
Well, at least one of those choices does stand a good chance

395
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:46,913
of preserving American lives.

396
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:48,363
You mean withdrawal.

397
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,181
We are nearing the time and we have to consider it.

398
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:54,181
We're not there yet, Ethan.

399
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,622
I can't discuss this.

400
00:21:56,768 --> 00:22:00,381
Not until we have explored every possible option.

401
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,901
Tell the FBI to keep working on Almeida.

402
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:07,820
Yes, madam president.

403
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,420
Mr. Buchanan. I've got the secure line.

404
00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:22,742
All right. Dial the number.

405
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:29,562
Bill, stop screwing around. Tell me what the hell is going on!

406
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,573
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.

407
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:33,721
He's working deep cover. He's working with me.

408
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:36,371
We have proof that he tried to bring down two commercial airliners.

409
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:37,773
You don't know the whole story.

410
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:39,162
That's part of an ongoing operation.

411
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:41,491
Operation? What kind of operation

412
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:43,723
puts hundreds if not thousands of lives in danger.

413
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:45,131
Jack, please.

414
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:46,463
You need to listen.

415
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:47,891
Our government is corrupted.

416
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,073
There are people on the inside

417
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,980
who are actively aiding Dubaku and Juma regime.

418
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:58,103
Point is Tony was supposed to be near the CIP module the whole time.

419
00:22:58,987 --> 00:23:01,672
With him in custody, we've lost our ability

420
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,422
to control it and to attack this conspiracy.

421
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:05,381
Who's a part of the conspiracy? Give me names.

422
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:07,022
We don't know the extent of it.

423
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:08,520
We have reason to believe

424
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:10,343
that members of the president's inner council are on payroll.

425
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:11,842
Who's sheperding you this information? Which agency?

426
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:13,423
Let's just take it, Jack. There's no sheperd.

427
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:17,832
There is no agency. This corruption runs deep and wide.

428
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,252
We're working outside the government.

429
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:22,782
It's why we have to get Tony back under cover.

430
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:25,002
He's at FBI headquarters, Bill.

431
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:26,580
I never said it's gonna be easy.

432
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,123
But we have to try.

433
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:32,282
Chloe is already into their system.

434
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:33,741
Chloe's working on this?

435
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:35,683
Hi, Jack. It's good to hear your voice.

436
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:37,123
Yeah. You, too.

437
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:38,850
I saw the hearing on c span

438
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:40,871
I can't believe what the senator said to you.

439
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,190
You looked good go.

440
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,393
Jack we need your help to get Tony out of there.

441
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,971
There's an agent at the FBI Renee Walker. She could help.

442
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:51,161
No, the FBI has been compromised.

443
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:53,322
Somebody in the bereau is aiding Dubaku.

444
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:55,051
You don't understand, Bill, jack, I trust her.

445
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:57,003
Jack, if you think you need to use her

446
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:59,343
to get Tony out of FBI headquarters, then do it.

447
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:01,113
But you'll be making her a target.

448
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:05,371
No, you're right.

449
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,641
You're right. We'll do it your way. I can get to Tony myself.

450
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,342
But Chloe's gonna have to get us outside the building.

451
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,703
We're already on it.

452
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,252
Get back to me as soon as you are ready.

453
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:14,773
I'm on my way, Chloe.

454
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,901
Hey, Sean. You know these data mining plugins we downloaded last week,

455
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,602
where do we file those?

456
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,693
Where do we file those?

457
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah. File folder A76.

458
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,030
Do you need help with something?

459
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:51,282
No. Why?

460
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,123
You seem confused.

461
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,062
I just don't like having to dance around this level-4 lockdown.

462
00:24:58,136 --> 00:25:01,121
Oh, well, I thought you welcomed the opportunity to complain about something.

463
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:34,272
Hello?

464
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:35,993
Mr. Taylor. It's Samantha.

465
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:39,561
I was going to call you.

466
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:42,631
I owe you an apology, Sam.

467
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:45,441
I was wrong to confront you like that.

468
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:48,302
Uh, no. You weren't.

469
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:52,272
I wasn't completely honest to you.

470
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:53,762
What do you mean?

471
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:57,952
Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr. Taylor.

472
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,632
He was murdered.

473
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:06,752
I need to see you. Alone.

474
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,800
Will you meet me?

475
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:12,472
Of course.

476
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,781
Where is the CIP device, Tony?

477
00:26:16,766 --> 00:26:18,812
Who would you gave it to?

478
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,330
People you're taking money from.

479
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:27,871
Thought you might like to see some of their handywork.

480
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:33,733
You know how many people they've killed

481
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:36,170
since they went back into Sangala?

482
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:42,730
Two hundred thousand and counting.

483
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:44,411
Most of them women and children.

484
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,132
Tony.

485
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:51,072
You really want this on your conscience?

486
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:59,471
My conscience is clear.

487
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,503
There's nothing you can say or do will change that.

488
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:04,902
So why don't you do the smart thing

489
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:07,383
and tell president Taylor to stand down the strike force?

490
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:09,762
Because unless she does,

491
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:12,860
planes will be falling from the sky.

492
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:16,401
And then you'll have a whole new batch of photoes to look at.

493
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:22,490
Only this time, they'll be of dead Americans.

494
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:27,582
Larry, we need to talk.

495
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,393
Almeida's not gonna break.

496
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:44,500
We don't know that.

497
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,183
He's a trained CTU agent.

498
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,040
He's conducted interrogations just like this one.

499
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:49,951
There's nothing you can say to him

500
00:27:49,997 --> 00:27:51,792
that he hasn't said to himself a hundred times.

501
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:53,031
So what are you suggesting? We give up?

502
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:56,971
No. I'm suggesting we might need more forceful approach.

503
00:27:58,425 --> 00:27:59,980
You mean torture.

504
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,510
No, there are methods of coercion

505
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,080
that we haven't even considered. Pharmaceuticals...

506
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:06,442
I can't believe you wanna have this conversation.

507
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:08,060
You're not hearing the argument...

508
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:11,090
The argument is crazy. It's illegal.

509
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,920
And it's over. As a matter of fact, I want Bauer out of here.

510
00:28:14,016 --> 00:28:15,430
He's a wildcard. He's dangerous.

511
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:16,971
I want him out of the building.

512
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,402
Go. Process him out. I will continue here.

513
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:21,791
Go. Go! Now.

514
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,042
Renee, I was just about to call you.

515
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:41,793
I may have found the leak.

516
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:44,173
Someone did a runaround under level-4 lockdown.

517
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,282
They circumvented the security fence

518
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:47,960
and they hacked into the FAA database.

519
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,170
FAA, are you sure?

520
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,412
Positive. I don't what they were doing in there,

521
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:53,151
but they had to navigate some very sophisticated tagger software.

522
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:54,101
When was this?

523
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:55,083
Just a few minutes ago.

524
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,213
Any idea who it was?

525
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,360
No. But I may be able to pull out user ID out of the terminal.

526
00:28:58,418 --> 00:28:59,430
Okay, which terminal?

527
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,862
Main frame room, terminal three.

528
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:02,701
- Check it out. Let me know what you find. - Ok.

529
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,111
Agent Tyler.

530
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:08,382
I need you to prepare the briefing package for Jack Bauer

531
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,763
and bring me his personal effects.

532
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:10,841
Yeah, I'll bring them right to you.

533
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:12,383
Thanks. I'll be in my office.

534
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:00,471
Last login: Sean Hillinger

535
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:01,022
What are you doing?

536
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:04,431
What's the matter?

537
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:08,740
Just, you just stay where you're.

538
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:12,310
Janis, stop it.

539
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:14,790
Would you just talk to me?

540
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:18,630
I know you've been helping Tony Almeida.

541
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:20,592
What? Are you crazy?

542
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:21,110
No.

543
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:22,793
You broke into the FAA database,

544
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:24,403
that's your server ID.

545
00:30:25,647 --> 00:30:26,723
Yes, my server ID,

546
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:28,211
but I'm not helping the terrorists,

547
00:30:28,215 --> 00:30:29,211
you wanna know why I was in there,

548
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:30,330
I'll tell you, I was worried.

549
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,870
My wife on of those planes up there,

550
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,672
I had to see if her flight had been grounded yet.

551
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:35,700
You expect me to believe that?

552
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:37,101
Why are you sneeking around?

553
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:40,282
'cause the level 4 lockdown cut me out of the FAA database

554
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,051
I couldn't monitor her flight.

555
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,901
Look, see for yourself.

556
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,783
Flight 112 out of the Las Vegas.

557
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,391
Christina Hillinger

558
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:57,913
Okay, just stay there.

559
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:01,910
CHRISTINA HILLINGER

560
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:04,921
God, Shawn, you scared the hell outta me,

561
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,193
why wouldn't you just tell me that?

562
00:31:06,637 --> 00:31:08,292
'cause what I was doing was borderline illegal,

563
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:09,490
I didn't wanna get you in trouble.

564
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,610
plus, you looked like you've had enough on your plate.

565
00:31:11,877 --> 00:31:14,413
Damn it, I told Renee I'd found a security leak.

566
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:16,233
Is that what's going on around here?

567
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:17,630
There's just a security leak?

568
00:31:17,787 --> 00:31:19,412
Don't worry about it, go back to your station,

569
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:21,031
keep this to yourself

570
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,830
and I will clean up your mess.

571
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:24,771
Go.

572
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:31,160
Idiot.

573
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:36,251
Go ahead.

574
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:37,970
Jack, agent Walker is on her way,

575
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:39,573
she's heading down the corridor toward your room.

576
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:40,791
Copy that.

577
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:42,422
How are you doing with the loops?

578
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:43,742
I'm dropping the first one in now.

579
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:45,212
I have a series of loops

580
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:46,411
and I'm dropping them as you go.

581
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:48,602
Security won't see a thing.

582
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:50,390
Understand.

583
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,653
Standing by.

584
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,221
Sorry, Jack. We're proceeding without you.

585
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:07,830
Wasn't my decision.

586
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:11,833
Well, we would't have Almeida without you,

587
00:32:11,937 --> 00:32:13,531
we own you alot.

588
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:15,002
Thanks.

589
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:17,390
That paperwork for me?

590
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,532
Yeah, you need to fill this out.

591
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:28,450
I want you to know I'm gonna put in a good word with the Justice Department for you.

592
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,030
Maybe it will help.

593
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,311
Thanks.

594
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:35,032
Jack.

595
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:37,273
Don't fight it.

596
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:38,921
Jack.

597
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,690
Don't fight it.

598
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:16,742
Jack just took out agent Walker,

599
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:18,371
he has her keycard and her weapon.

600
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:19,573
He's going to get Tony.

601
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:20,413
What's your location.

602
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:21,602
About ten minutes out.

603
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:23,822
Did you get my rendezvous point?

604
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:26,872
Just showed up on my GPS.

605
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:28,140
Okay, great...

606
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:29,691
I gotta go, it's Jack.

607
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:31,201
Jack?

608
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:34,163
I'm ready.I've got access to Interrogation One,

609
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:35,300
what's Bill's ETA?

610
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:36,682
About ten minutes.

611
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:39,001
How's the corridor?

612
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:39,853
Clear.

613
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:41,670
Wait for my call.

614
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,151
Put your weapons down, now!

615
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:55,410
What the hell do you think you're doing?

616
00:33:55,648 --> 00:33:56,990
I said do it now!

617
00:33:58,046 --> 00:33:58,951
Do it or I will kill him.

618
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,140
Okay, all right.

619
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:02,002
Put it down, it's all right, do it.

620
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:05,372
Slowly, slowly.

621
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:10,410
Now, you. Do it!

622
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:11,480
All right.

623
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:19,733
Kick the weapon over to me.

624
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:21,543
Come on.

625
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:22,603
Okay, all right.

626
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:25,372
Uncuff him.

627
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:27,783
Where's agent Walker?

628
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:28,381
What did you do to her?

629
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:29,320
Shut up!

630
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:30,562
Bauer, you're gonna make it outta here.

631
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,022
I said shut up.

632
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:35,491
I talked to Bill.

633
00:34:35,597 --> 00:34:36,552
How much did he tell you?

634
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:38,083
Enough, we're gonna get you outta here.

635
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:39,940
Chole's tapped into the security.

636
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:41,533
She's gonna walk us outta this building,

637
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:42,933
all you need to do is follow my lead.

638
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:45,200
Chole, it's Jack, do you copy?

639
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:45,941
Copy, Jack.

640
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,521
I got Tony at the door of Interrogation One leading out to the hallway.

641
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:49,490
Okay, I see you,

642
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:51,290
I'm gonna direct you to the southwest exit.

643
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:53,790
Right now you're in the least populated area of the building.

644
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:56,102
But you're gonna run into a lot more resistance before you get outta there.

645
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:57,571
Copy that, you ready?

646
00:34:57,588 --> 00:34:58,280
Clear to move.

647
00:34:58,356 --> 00:34:59,543
Let's go.

648
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,790
Hold on, there're two people coming out of the elevator.

649
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:06,881
Copy that, come on.

650
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:18,763
Listen, Jack, i'm sorry for the stuff I said back there.

651
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:20,560
Just needed to get you close enough

652
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,063
to give you Bill's codename.

653
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:24,440
Just glad I didn't break you neck.

654
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:26,840
Well, you came close.

655
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:30,673
Yeah, sorry about that.

656
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:32,322
Okay, clear.

657
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:33,740
We're clear.

658
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:51,042
I cleaned up your trail,

659
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,643
we will just keep this transgression between us.

660
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:56,080
Although I don't know what I'm gonna tell Renee.

661
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:58,571
Have you heard one thing I've just said?

662
00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:00,792
Yeah, yeah, that's fine, take a look at this.

663
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:02,111
What?

664
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,532
There's a performance hit on one of our signal routers,

665
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,030
It's down 0.7%

666
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:16,371
You're right, somebody is riding our bandwith.

667
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:18,791
Hecking in, is that possible? With all the safeguards?

668
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:20,640
Anything is possible

669
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,940
if you know what you're doing.

670
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:25,733
They're inside our security sub-net.

671
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:27,683
They've accessed the surveillance system.

672
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:29,641
What are you gonna do?

673
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,472
Lock them out.

674
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,161
Okay, Jack, you're gonna make a left down the next hallway.

675
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,163
There's an emergency stairwell at the end.

676
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:47,940
Will that stairwell get us down the ground level?

677
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:48,873
Yes.

678
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:50,012
Copy that.

679
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:58,052
Hold on.

680
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,170
What's wrong?

681
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:00,613
I lost my feed.

682
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,592
Chole's feed just went down.

683
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:06,793
What did you do?

684
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,431
I've pinged the line and it automatically reset.

685
00:37:08,897 --> 00:37:10,293
Someone was hacking in,

686
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,492
they were taking out our surveillance cameras.

687
00:37:12,507 --> 00:37:14,562
Janis, take a look at this.

688
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:15,823
Send it to me.

689
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:25,672
Security, this is Janis Gold.

690
00:37:26,136 --> 00:37:27,302
We have a code 12 in progress,

691
00:37:27,408 --> 00:37:28,800
we need a team to Interrogation One.

692
00:37:29,026 --> 00:37:30,053
Yes, ma'am, right away.

693
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:34,460
All agents, security breach, code 12.

694
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:37,161
We gotta keep moving, let's go.

695
00:37:55,837 --> 00:37:58,211
Security team between us at the southwest exit.

696
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,713
Chloe, what have you got? We're boxed in.

697
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:02,421
Someone at FBI is blocking my every move,

698
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:03,521
it's really starting to piss me off.

699
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,563
You need to get them back into their system,

700
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,760
otherwise we're not gonna make it outta here.

701
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:08,311
Jack, I'm sorry, I'm trying.

702
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:28,510
We've got make a move, Jack.

703
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:29,623
I know.

704
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:32,892
Let's go now.

705
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:47,931
Chole, talk to me.

706
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:49,691
I'm still locked out, trying to work around it.

707
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:51,561
Jack, we're sitting ducks if we stay here.

708
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:52,763
I know.

709
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:55,681
Chole, we have to take the stairwell,

710
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:56,780
we don't have a choice.

711
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,933
Quietly.

712
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:03,842
Where are they?

713
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:05,671
We're looking.

714
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,373
Find them.

715
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:16,872
Are you all right?

716
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:18,492
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, are you okay?

717
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:19,150
Yeah.

718
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:21,503
They're still in the buidling, we're trying to locate them.

719
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:23,041
I can't believe this, what the hell is Jack doing?

720
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:25,762
He's helping his friend escape, that's what he's doing.

721
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:28,913
I'm--I'm sorry, Larry. I shouldn't have trusted him.

722
00:39:29,187 --> 00:39:29,802
I got them.

723
00:39:30,098 --> 00:39:31,362
Southwest stairwell.

724
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:32,863
Security, this is Moss,

725
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,861
suspects are from southwest stairwell, descending.

726
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,711
Pass the fifth floor.

727
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:38,431
Lock on the building perimeter

728
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:40,631
and deploy two teams in the first floor service corridor.

729
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,413
Be aware, the suspects are armed.

730
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:43,531
We need them alive.

731
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:47,313
Okay, I'm back up, Jack.

732
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:48,412
Copy that.

733
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:52,412
What was that?

734
00:39:52,905 --> 00:39:53,601
Heckers' back in,

735
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,400
whoever this is, they're very good.

736
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:56,833
Well, lock them out.

737
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:57,953
I'm trying.

738
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:01,042
Jack, hold up.

739
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:01,853
What is it?

740
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,360
You're heading into an ambush, the six-man team.

741
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,480
They're heading up toward you in the stairwell.

742
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:07,290
Understand, we will evade.

743
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:08,490
They're coming on the stairs.

744
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:12,043
Pass me that fire extinguisher.

745
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:27,961
We're on the roof of the parking lot.

746
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,200
I see you, good work.

747
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:30,580
Go to the north end, Jack.

748
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:31,583
Bill's almost there.

749
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:32,612
He's in the blue van.

750
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:33,733
Copy that.

751
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,150
They're outside, they went through the third floor window.

752
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:38,103
Let's go.

753
00:40:38,345 --> 00:40:40,203
Perimeter team, they're in the parking garage.

754
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:42,350
Notify Matro police, have them corden off a five-block perimeter.

755
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:47,711
On the right, get down.

756
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:54,613
We gotta get you outta here and back undercover,

757
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:56,080
I will be right behind you, go.

758
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:39,531
This is gonna hurt.

759
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,410
Tony, let's go.

760
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:05,692
Come on, Jack.

761
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,122
Go, Bill.

762
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:27,450
Agent Moss, they're gone,

763
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:28,751
they got outside the perimeter.

764
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:42,163
All right, Chole, I got them,

765
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,162
any sign of pursuit?

766
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:45,353
Not so far, they must be still mobilizing,

767
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:46,560
we caught them off guard.

768
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:47,741
Traffice cams.

769
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:49,980
I'm cycling the frequcies to clear path now.

770
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:50,850
Good.

771
00:42:51,627 --> 00:42:52,342
Are you all right?

772
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:53,423
I'm fine, where are we going?

773
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:54,492
It's not far.

774
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:57,041
Bill, I did what you wanted, I got Tony out of there.

775
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,290
Tell me what's going on?

776
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:00,670
When we get there, I will tell you everything.
