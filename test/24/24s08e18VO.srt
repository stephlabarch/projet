3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,474
Someone needs to take the reins
of the IRK government.

4
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:19,060
Someone who believes
in the same ideals

5
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,936
and principles as Omar Hassan

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,004
and who shares his strength.

7
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,107
If it is the will of my people,

8
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:28,235
I will take my husband's place
at the peace conference.

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,753
Did you find him,

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,781
the man who killed my father?

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,784
Samir Mehran, yes.

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,078
He was badly wounded,
but he'll live to stand trial.

13
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,913
<i>I took care of him. </i>

14
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,570
So there is no connection to us.
We're in the clear?

15
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:42,965
<i>Maybe not. </i>

16
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,002
There was a woman

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,160
- <i>who might have recognized me.</i>
- <i>What woman?</i>

18
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,241
<i>She may be CTU.
I'm not sure,</i>

19
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,550
but I've seen her face before.

20
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:52,843
Once again,

21
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,720
Mr. Novakovich, you're giving

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,409
every indication
that Russia has no interest

23
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:58,950
in this peace accord.

24
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:00,893
I don't understand

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,062
how you can believe
that installing Hassan's wife

26
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,814
will alleviate our concerns

27
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,441
about the instability
of the IRK government.

28
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:10,528
I have close friends in Moscow.

29
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,958
Do you honestly think
your relationships

30
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,990
- can change their minds?
- Let's just say

31
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,058
I'm going to be
able to exercise some leverage.

32
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,538
Jack thinks that someone inside

33
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,323
is working for the terrorists.

34
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,083
I spoke to Hastings.

35
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,543
He cleared me through.

36
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:28,921
Stay where you are...

37
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,966
She entered the parking.

38
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,055
Who are you, you lying bitch?

39
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,566
Don't move.

40
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,232
<i>You were on the phone
before she got shot.</i>

41
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:57,816
What were you talking about?

42
00:01:58,428 --> 00:02:01,537
Samir Mehran was given a lethal
injection at the scene of his capture.

43
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,956
<i>She thought she recognized
one of the EMT from her days</i>

44
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,499
undercover with the mob.

45
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,543
I've got to get back to you.

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,170


47
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,629
She didn't make it.

48
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,958
I'm so sorry,
but we need to move her now.

49
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,655
Are you the husband of the deceased?

50
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,913
We need to contact her next of kin.

51
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,526
Can you help us with that?

52
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,586
Do you know where her parents live?

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,286
Are they alive?

54
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:31,961
I don't know.

55
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,672
Sir, are you gonna be all right?

56
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,047
I don't know if these will fit.
I got them from an intern.

57
00:03:58,248 --> 00:03:59,248
Thank you.

58
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,112
Jack, I heard about Renee.

59
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:53,667
I'm so sorry.

60
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:56,147
<i>What can I do to help?</i>

61
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,463
Tell me who did this.

62
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:02,032
You told me earlier Renee recognized
someone at Hassan's crime scene.

63
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,157
An EMT?

64
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,601
Let us deal with that.
Everyone's on it.

65
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,833
Don't try and handle me,
Chloe, not now.

66
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:10,713
Who did she see?

67
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:14,182
She thought she recognized somebody
from the Russian mob... Red Square.

68
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:16,919
- Bazhaev's group?
- Right.

69
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:19,781
- I want to talk to him.
- Like I said, I'm already on it.

70
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:22,404
He's in custody somewhere, Chloe.
I brought him in myself.

71
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,608
<i>Where is he?</i>

72
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,045
There's something
that you need to know.

73
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,119
Division replaced Hastings...
with me.

74
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,083
<i>That means I'm responsible
for what happens to Bazhaev.</i>

75
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,624
<i>I know you're upset about Renee.</i>

76
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,119
So am I.

77
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,588
But Bazhaev's our only lead.
I need someone in complete control.

78
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:42,883
- <i>I don't think that's you right now.</i>
- I won't interfere

79
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,416
with your investigation.

80
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,217
- You think you can stick to that?
- I give you my word.

81
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,956
I'm gonna ask you one more time:
Where is he?

82
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,480
He's in federal court.

83
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,172
<i>He's being arraigned right now.</i>

84
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,840
Plan was for this chamber
to be full by now.

85
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:08,742
Ethan, what in the world

86
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,068
are you doing here?

87
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:11,982
You should be resting.

88
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:13,656
The doctor said it was my call.

89
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,249
I'm fine.

90
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,491
I was thinking, Madam President,
our discussion

91
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,481
about enlisting Charles Logan.

92
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:23,606
It's done.

93
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:25,759
You've contacted him?

94
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,012
He's on his way to talk
to the Foreign Minister.

95
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,264
That was fast.

96
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,616
The Russians were about to announce
they were pulling out of the talks.

97
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,741
I didn't see a lot of options.

98
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:38,731
What's his angle?

99
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:45,612
Madam President, you said
he's on his way to talk to Novakovich.

100
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:50,634
How does he intend
to get the Russians to stay?

101
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,788
I assume he uncovered something
in his business dealings

102
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,956
with them.

103
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,499
But you don't know what?

104
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,169
Not exactly.

105
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:03,005
Madam President,
he's operating in your name.

106
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:05,951
Shouldn't we find out?

107
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,052
I agreed I wouldn't.

108
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:12,598
Don't ask, don't tell was the price
for Logan's cooperation.

109
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,137
Mikhail!

110
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,229
Mr. President.

111
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,639
The Russian people join you

112
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:36,622
in mourning President Hassan.

113
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:40,301
His death was a tragedy
for all peace-loving nations.

114
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,294
You can save your atitudes.

115
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:44,880
You want the truth.

116
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,281
Why not... for a change?

117
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,811
Espresso.

118
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:58,304
I assume
President Taylor sent you here

119
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,991
to bring my country back
to the barining table.

120
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:03,398
She is going to be disappointed.

121
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,176
She lured the whole world here
with the promise

122
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,865
that Hassan had united the IRK,
that there would be peace

123
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,617
for the first time in decades.

124
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,700
Now it is clear that was a lie.

125
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,123
There was no unity even with Hassan,

126
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,091
and now that he is gone...

127
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,716
His widow Dalia can pick up
the mantle.

128
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,155
Not in our estimation.

129
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:29,383
Hassan was undone
by his own opposition.

130
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,635
How could his widow
succeed where he failed?

131
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,098
'Cause we both know the opposition
that undid him had outside help.

132
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:42,604
Nuclear threats, assassination plots
against a heavily guarded

133
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,882
head of state.

134
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:47,649
This was not some
Third World malcontents lashing out.

135
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,362
This was a highly organized effort

136
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:54,178
orchestrated by a major rival
to the United States,

137
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:57,885
a rival convinced
that their best interest

138
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:01,290
was to stop the peace process

139
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,827
by killing Hassan.

140
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:04,376
If you are insinuating...

141
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,548
Insinuating, no. I'm saying
it was people inside your government,

142
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,216
first among them you.

143
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,174
That is an outrageous accusation.

144
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,342
It's a fact for which I have proof.

145
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:23,645
- I don't believe you.
- Well, that's your right.

146
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,560
But I'll tell you this,
you don't want to test me.

147
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:32,196
Because what I have,
I will share with President Taylor

148
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,654
if you and I
fail to come to an understanding here.

149
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,235
Espresso, sir.

150
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:49,338
At this point President Taylor
knows nothing about any of this.

151
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:52,541
I didn't see what good
could come out

152
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,719
of inflaming the situation
between our countries further,

153
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,593
not without talking to you first.

154
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:06,521
And now I have.

155
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:10,967
The president's expecting me
at the UN.

156
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:12,027
I need to go.

157
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:15,948
- What will you tell her?
- I'd would like to tell her

158
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,768
Russia is back at the table

159
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:19,952
and her peace process is on track.

160
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,498
But if neither of us

161
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,098
hears from you before I get there,

162
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,911
I'm afraid what I'll have to tell her
is the unvarnished truth.

163
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,598
"Sergei... Buh-zay-off."

164
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,267
Bazhaev, Your Honor.

165
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,804
We'd like to waive reading.

166
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,588
I'm sure you would,
given the charges here.

167
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,778
I can tell you right now
I'm gonna deny bail.

168
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:53,192
Judge Ruffin,
Sergei Bazhaev is a businessman

169
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,279
with deep ties to this community.

170
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,979
He's a foreign national.

171
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,324
That's true, Your Honor,
but he has lived

172
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,576
in this country continuously
since 1985.

173
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,894
His entire family lives here.

174
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:04,788
In fact,

175
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,416
several members of his family
are represented in court,

176
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,960
his wife, daughter-in-law, grandson,

177
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,963
for whom incidentally
he is the sole means of support.

178
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,133
According to the charges,
he's their sole support

179
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,080
because he killed the boy's father,

180
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:20,099
not to mention the other counts:

181
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:23,473
trafficking in nuclear materials,
assassination, conspiracy.

182
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,311
Like I said, I'm going to deny bail.

183
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:30,188
I'm remanding him
to Marion immediately.

184
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,238
Your Honor, may I have
five minutes with my client?

185
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:42,451
Fine. You have five minutes.
Court will recess for 30 minutes.

186
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,861
Clear the courtroom, please.

187
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,462
My client would like
to have a word with you.

188
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:14,519
If you touch my family,
I swear to God...

189
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,719
You're not sitting in the right chair
to be making threats.

190
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,650
Who shot Renee Walker?

191
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:22,949
I don't know her.

192
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,851
She was a former FBI agent.
Approximately six years ago,

193
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:27,996
she worked undercover
in your organization.

194
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:31,802
Earlier today, she recognized
one of your men as Red Square.

195
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:33,210
There is no Red Square.

196
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:34,583
Not anymore.

197
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,646
Let me explain myself.

198
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,348
This agent...

199
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,261
I considered her to be my family.

200
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,198
So take a long hard look
into my eyes

201
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:51,355
and realize
that I will have no problem

202
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,525
taking out each member of yours
before they even get home today

203
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,775
unless I get the information I want.

204
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,206
Whoever killed her,

205
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:02,257
had nothing to do with me.

206
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,194
Enjoy your time at Marion.

207
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,539
I'll tell your wife
and your daughter-in-law you said hello.

208
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,458


209
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:15,451
Wait!

210
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,182
If I tell you,

211
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:28,974
they'll kill my family.

212
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:31,290
We'll provide them
with witness protection.

213
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,898
I give you my word.

214
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,237
Moscow.

215
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:47,909
The Russian government...
They're behind it, not me.

216
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:52,253
Everything that happened today,
all of it, was them.

217
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,875
- Who inside the government?
- I don't know.

218
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,821
You're talking about 100,000 people.

219
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:58,795
- I need names.
- I don't know names.

220
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,381
They never let me get close.

221
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,799
The woman working for them
arranged everything.

222
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:04,634
Who?

223
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,341
The one they planted at CTU.

224
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:09,639


225
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,350


226
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,258
You promised.

227
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,151


228
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,500
Nerve-wracking, isn't it?
Waiting.

229
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,995
I only saw Novakovich's face,

230
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,879
but you definitely
had his attention.

231
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:46,512
It's the president.

232
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,477
{\Charles Logan.
Charles.
Yes, Madam President.}

233
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,749
I just got off the phone
with the Russian foreign minister.

234
00:14:58,602 --> 00:14:59,523
You did?

235
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:03,026
- And what did he say?
- He said that the two of you

236
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,190
had a very interesting discussion.

237
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,391
And that he would be coming
to the UN in five hours

238
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,909
with the Russian premier
to sign the treaty

239
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,035
<i>as scheduled.</i>

240
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,371
<i>He also said the credit for that</i>

241
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:15,783
<i>is all yours.</i>

242
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:19,834
He was in the mood to be convinced,
Madam President.

243
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,911
Mr. President, Ethan Kanin here.

244
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,089
- So you're back on your feet.
- Yes.

245
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,557
And I'm curious.

246
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,175
What did you say

247
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,774
<i>to the Russian minister to convince him
to come back to the peace talks?</i>

248
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,682
I told him that peace
is in all of our interests.

249
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,476
Seriously,

250
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,943
<i>I'd like to know how you did it.</i>

251
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:42,825
Madam President,
those details are for me alone.

252
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,192
That was our agreement.

253
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,410
Am I right?

254
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:47,167
Yes, you are.

255
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:48,722
So, Ethan...

256
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,645
let's not do anything...

257
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,862
to sully our victory.

258
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,121
And it is a victory.

259
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:58,041
<i>For all of us.</i>

260
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:01,511
<i>It's a good feeling, isn't it?</i>

261
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:02,586
What?

262
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:04,623
Being of service....

263
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:06,313
To your country.

264
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,010
Yes, it is.

265
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,665
<i>I'll see you at the UN shortly.</i>

266
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,145
{\O'Brian.
Hey, it's me.}

267
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,386
Bazhaev's family left the courthouse.
They're going to need protection.

268
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,775
- I want you to bring them in.
- What did he say?

269
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,509
The people who are behind
Renee's murder weren't Russian mob.

270
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:30,874
Said they were people
inside the Russian government.

271
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,116
He claims that they're behind
what happened today.

272
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,681
I thought the IRK opposition
was trying to stop Hassan.

273
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:37,482
He said the Russians
were using them.

274
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:40,416
He didn't explain why they don't want
the peace accord to go through,

275
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,051
but he did say something important.

276
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:45,086
He said Moscow's main contact
on the ground was Dana Walsh.

277
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,130
Dana?
You believe that?

278
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:50,091
That would explain
how she managed to breach CTU.

279
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,511
- I'm on my way. I want to talk to her.
- I'll set it up. 

280
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,395
I need your help.

281
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,356
Jack's on his way to interview Dana.

282
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,874
Dana? What about?

283
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,526
She's some kind of agent
with the Russian government.

284
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:13,173
He says they're behind
everything that happened today.

285
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:15,158


286
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,565
If she knows who killed Renee or Jack
thinks she's in any way responsible,

287
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,372
there's no telling what he might do.

288
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,750
He respects you.
You might be the only one

289
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,044
who can deal with things
if he gets out of hand.

290
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,834
I know this is difficult for you,

291
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,394
- but during the questioning...
- I'll be there.

292
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,344


293
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,262
It's good to be back in the game,

294
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,895
even if it is
through the rear entrance.

295
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,500
President Taylor's worried
about her image.

296
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,198
Believe me,
I of all people understand that.

297
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,048
She can't keep you
hidden away forever.

298
00:17:58,173 --> 00:17:59,078
That's right.

299
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,830
Credit given where credit is due.
Publicly.

300
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,213
That's our deal.

301
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,548
Right.

302
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,095
Believe me,
the president will be grateful to know.

303
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:22,914
Who is that agent?
I want him reassigned.

304
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,979
- That was my contact at Justice...
- Did you hear me?

305
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,690
I'll take care of it.
But we have a more immediate problem.

306
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:40,924
What does he have to do with this?

307
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,581
He was at the federal courthouse,
the arraignment of a Sergei Bazhaev.

308
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,182
Bauer got to him behind closed doors
and got him to talk.

309
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,712
- How much does Bazhaev know?
- He knows about Dana Walsh,

310
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:54,443
- the mole the Russians planted at CTU.
- I know who she is.

311
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:57,673
Bauer's headed to CTU,

312
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,996
presumably to talk to her.

313
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,994
My sources tell me
Walsh hasn't given up anything

314
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,463
about Moscow's involvement.
Not yet.

315
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:10,416
But she knows enough
to bring everything down.

316
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,341
- If she gets in a room with him...
- Obviously, that can't happen.

317
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,445
We need to stop Bauer
before he talks to her.

318
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,419
That won't be easy.
He may have a personal stake in this.

319
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:21,284
Apparently, he was asking
Bazhaev about a Renee Walker.

320
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:25,073
She was shot dead in Bauer's apartment
less than an hour ago.

321
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,289
This could easily get out of hand.

322
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:37,083
You may need to ask
President Taylor to intervene.

323
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,559
Are you suggesting
that I tell her the truth?

324
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:42,722
If she finds out what they've done,
she'll be furious I kept her out of it.

325
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:47,435
- She might back out of our deal.
- You really need to stop Bauer now.

326
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:50,951
I don't see any other way.

327
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,276
You have to talk to the president.

328
00:19:57,939 --> 00:19:59,979
Bauer torpedoed my presidency.

329
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,709
Tried to ruin me, almost did.

330
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,307
There's no way
I'm gonna let that happen again.

331
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,088
Thank you.

332
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:18,828
- Dana Walsh ready?
- Yes, I'll take you to her.

333
00:20:20,238 --> 00:20:21,836
I'm so sorry about Renee.

334
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:24,314
I don't even know what to say.

335
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,360
Dana know I'm going to be
interrogating her?

336
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,071
- I didn't want to give her a heads-up.
- Good.

337
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,970
I'm sorry about Renee.

338
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,291
I have to leave the cameras on.

339
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:52,876
You think I'm gonna kill her?

340
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:55,169
I wouldn't blame.

341
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,666
If I wanted her dead, she'd be dead.

342
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,689
I'm just gonna wake her up
to the idea of it.

343
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,632
Open the door.

344
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:21,112
What do you want?

345
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,327
I want to know
who killed Renee Walker.

346
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:30,121
She's dead?

347
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,997
That doesn't make any sense.

348
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:38,296
It must have been a mistake.

349
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:40,941
No mistake.

350
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:45,723
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:49,641
Really.

352
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:52,274
You're sorry?

353
00:21:57,746 --> 00:21:58,896
You're sorry?

354
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,903
I want the shooter!

355
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,989
I want to know ordered it!
I want names!

356
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,385
- Stop him!
- Let it play.

357
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,231
<i>Stop. Or you get nothing.</i>

358
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:11,496
You think you get
to make demands here?

359
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:14,373
I can give you the hitter,

360
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:16,709
the man behind him,

361
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,059
- all the way up to the top.
- I want more,

362
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,246
- than just names. I want proof!
- I have proof.

363
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,990
An audio file,

364
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,886
- film.
- Where?

365
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:31,273
First I want my immunity deal back.

366
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,252
Soon as I start talking, I'm dead.

367
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:40,615
Your move.

368
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:53,037
If you lie to me.

369
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:57,693
I'll find you
no matter where you try and hide.

370
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:00,037
You understand that?

371
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:04,989
Good.

372
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,466
We've had such little good news
these last few hours,

373
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:26,404
I wanted to tell you right away.
The delegates have voted

374
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,610
unanimously to accept you
as the representative of the IRK

375
00:23:29,735 --> 00:23:32,243
- at the signing of the treaty.
- I'm pleased.

376
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:35,607
Thank you for all your efforts.

377
00:23:35,785 --> 00:23:37,035
You're welcome.

378
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:39,407
There is one proviso, of course.

379
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:42,185
That my own country accept me
as signatory of the treaty.

380
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:44,891
I know you've had very little time
to pursue this.

381
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:46,632
Jamot and I have
been making progress.

382
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:50,569
Our constituent assembly
will vote on the issue,

383
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:53,463
but as we've already
received pledges of loyalty

384
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,646
from most of my husband's coalition,

385
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,254
I believe we have a good chance
of success.

386
00:23:58,379 --> 00:23:59,379
Excellent.

387
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:03,898
- We might just make it yet.
- We might.

388
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:07,904
I need a word.

389
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,619
Excuse me.

390
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:15,385
- Logan wants to speak with you.
- About what?

391
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,793
He wouldn't say
except that it's urgent.

392
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:19,718
He's waiting in your office.

393
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,364
<i>Following President Hassan's death,</i>

394
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:24,337
<i>the expectation
was that the delegates</i>

395
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,159
<i>to the peace conference,
would have to pack up and go home.</i>

396
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:30,600
<i>But the latest rumors coming out
of the UN are pretty sensational.</i>

397
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,845
<i>That Dalia Hassan might be stepping</i>

398
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,240
<i>into her husband's shoes.</i>

399
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:36,307
<i>There are already
street demonstrations</i>

400
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:38,732
<i>taking place in Kamistan</i>

401
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,686
<i>in support Mrs Hassan.</i>

402
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,298
- The president is here.
- Thank you.

403
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:55,228
Thank you for seeing me.

404
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:57,531
Ethan said you wanted
to speak with me.

405
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,158
Can we have the room, please?

406
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:17,682
- What's this about?
- Jack Bauer. He's out of control.

407
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,491
He's already pressured

408
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,353
a Russian mafioso in federal court,
and he's on his way

409
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,307
to question a woman
in custody at CTU.

410
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,776
Why does he want to talk to her?

411
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,613
He thinks she knows who's behind
the shooting of a Renee Walker.

412
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,576
Agent Walker?

413
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,537
She's dead?

414
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:49,720
How did this happen?

415
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,341
That's still being investigated,
but in the meantime,

416
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,927
what I'm saying is
Bauer needs to be stopped.

417
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,804
Why?

418
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:02,328
You're going to have to trust me.
What we need to do right now

419
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,396
- is lock Bauer down.
- You better tell me exactly

420
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,674
what's going on.

421
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,567
I won't do a thing about Jack Bauer

422
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:12,361
until you tell me the truth.

423
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:22,161
Elements inside
the Russian government

424
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:25,063
were behind both
the assassination of President Hassan

425
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:27,960
and the supply of nuclear material

426
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,711
to his enemies.

427
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:34,133
- The Russian government?
- Why they're back at the table?

428
00:26:34,652 --> 00:26:36,427
Because I threatened to expose

429
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,328
their role in today's events.

430
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:40,139
You knew about this

431
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,475
- and you didn't tell?
- I protected the President.

432
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,643
Protected her?

433
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,108
You've compromised her hopelessly!

434
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,482
Why didn't you say anything before?

435
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:52,375
I told you that I had leverage
with the Russians.

436
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,969
You must've understood
it was significant.

437
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:57,615
Significant, yes!
Evidence of a sex scandal,

438
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,784
some kind of financial malfeasance,

439
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:01,808
not this, for God's sake!

440
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:06,004
If I find...

441
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:08,626
that you were
in a position to prevent

442
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,061
- anything...
- No.

443
00:27:10,186 --> 00:27:12,088
This information
came to me only recently.

444
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,422
From whom?

445
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:16,592
- I can't tell you.
- You will.

446
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,902
I can't, Madam President,
because it would do no good.

447
00:27:20,027 --> 00:27:22,476
My sources would plausibly deny,

448
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:24,267
even knowing me.

449
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:32,233
Bauer is about to bring out the Russian
involvement into the open?

450
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,944
If he talks to Dana Walsh, yes.

451
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:38,071
The Russians inserted her at CTU
months ago.

452
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:39,696
She was their agent.

453
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:42,144
If Bauer gets to her,

454
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:45,279
it will all come out,
and then this, this...

455
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:47,397
will all be finished.

456
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,122
It's finished anyways.

457
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,377
Do you think the president wants
anything more to do with the Russians

458
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:53,910
after what they've done?

459
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:58,426
You do, Madame President,
because you

460
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,794
are looking at the bigger picture,

461
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:02,638
the greater good.

462
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,765
How can you call any of this good?

463
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,310
Because it is good,
an undeniable good!

464
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:10,146
A peace that's escaped the world
for generations!

465
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,364
That's what you're on the verge
of achieving.

466
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,317
Do you really want
to throw it all away?

467
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:16,235
Do you really think

468
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,404
Dalia Hassan will sit down
at the table

469
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:21,535
with the people
who murdered her husband?

470
00:28:22,295 --> 00:28:24,045
Who says she has to know?

471
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,615
Believe me, I know
how hard you worked for this,

472
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,086
how you sweated and prayed,
the sleepless nights.

473
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,254
I know.

474
00:28:35,832 --> 00:28:39,449
The power to make a difference...
that's why we came into politics.

475
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:40,593
How few of us

476
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:42,325
get to achieve it,

477
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:43,947
but you have...

478
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:48,127
You so nearly have.

479
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,686
Ethan will tell you to make a stand.

480
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,814
I applaud his moral clarity,
but then he's on the sidelines.

481
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,733
- He can afford it.
- That's enough!

482
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,818
Is the situation ideal? No!

483
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,269
Far from it,

484
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:02,020
but you have a real chance

485
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:06,077
to make the world a better place.

486
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:13,086
Don't listen to this, Allison.

487
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:16,796
If the treaty's not signed today,
it's not the end.

488
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,548
You can build a better peace,

489
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:21,808
with honest partners.

490
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,993
"There is a tide
in the affairs of men,

491
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:27,264
"which, taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune."

492
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:29,562
What the hell does that mean?

493
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:32,686
The president knows.

494
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:35,745
It's from Julius Caesar.

495
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:38,669
It means "Now or never. "

496
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,532
Madam President,
I have Jack Bauer for you.

497
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:49,578
Where is he?

498
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,468
He's at CTU.
He wants to talk to you

499
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,361
about an immunity agreement
for a Dana Walsh.

500
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,232
I'll have to call him back.

501
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:07,897
There is no choice here.

502
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:12,587
But there is a choice, Ethan,

503
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,428
and unfortunately,
only I can make it.

504
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,992
I'm going to CTU.

505
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,368
To do what?

506
00:30:32,057 --> 00:30:33,453
To see Jack Bauer.

507
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,676
- Has the president called back yet?
- Not yet.

508
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,182
Are you sure
you want to do this to yourself?

509
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:58,153
We can take it from here.

510
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:00,619
The minute Dana's immunity deal
is back in place,

511
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:02,448
we can roll up the names,
close this out.

512
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:04,028
I need to see this through.

513
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,384
Excuse me.
The president's on the phone,

514
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:09,509
line 3.

515
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,285
She asked for Chloe.

516
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,090
- I'm on my way to see you.
- You're coming to CTU?

517
00:31:25,748 --> 00:31:28,566
Yes, I'm almost there.
I need to talk to Jack Bauer.

518
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,427
Make sure he doesn't leave.

519
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:35,851
Let security know
the president will be here soon.

520
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,055
She's coming here?

521
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,104
That's what I just said.
Have them standing by.

522
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:44,944
- Why she doing this?
- She said she wants to talk to you.

523
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:48,004
- Why not just talk to me on the phone?
- I don't know.

524
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:50,324
You should probably meet her
in Hastings' office.

525
00:31:54,365 --> 00:31:55,365
Fine.

526
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:24,400
Welcome to CTU.
I'm Chloe O'Brian.

527
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,498
Thank you, Ms. O'Brian.
Is Jack inside?

528
00:32:26,623 --> 00:32:27,873
Right this way.

529
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,738
I want to say how grateful I am

530
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,898
for all your efforts today.

531
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,220
We've taken some pretty hard hits,

532
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:54,386
but we've managed
to keep ourselves in the game.

533
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:56,593
The peace process is still alive,

534
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,820
and I am counting on your hard
work and your vigilance

535
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,521
to keep it that way.

536
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,800
I know you won't let me down.

537
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:26,211
Thank you, Miss O'Brian.
I'll go up alone.

538
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:47,274
I am so sorry

539
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:49,293
about Agent Walker.

540
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:54,323
I gather she meant a lot to you.

541
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,995
Which makes
what I'm about to ask so very,

542
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,163
very hard.

543
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:04,208
Please, Jack.

544
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:13,092
I need you to stand down.

545
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:16,845
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

546
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:20,599
I do not want you
to question Dana Walsh.

547
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:24,468
Madam President the information
that I can extract from Dana Walsh

548
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:27,516
is not limited
to the murder of Renee Walker.

549
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,386
I believe she knows the names
of the people who facilitated

550
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:31,996
the assassination of Hassan,

551
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,337
people working
within the Russian government.

552
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,198
That is pure speculation.

553
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,636
Then let me question her.
If she's lying,

554
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,904
- you lose nothing.
- I'm sorry.

555
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:42,788
I won't give Dana Walsh immunity.

556
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:44,383
I can't.

557
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:48,442
The peace process is back on track.

558
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:51,777
Dalia Hassan will represent
her country at the signing.

559
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:53,481
The Russians have accepted her

560
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,499
and have undertaken
to support the treaty.

561
00:34:55,624 --> 00:34:57,511
They have been trying
to destroy the treaty.

562
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,930
- You can't trust them.
- You don't know that.

563
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,516
The information that I have
came from Sergei Bazhaev,

564
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,809
and I believe him.

565
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,061
If you let me question Dana Walsh,
I can prove it.

566
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,787
I won't allow it.

567
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,905
You don't want to know the truth.

568
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,797
What I want is to keep
the Russians at the table.

569
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:24,710
Allegations of this sort
will drive them away.

570
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,206
What if they are true?

571
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,096
If I keep the Russians at the table,
I can bring peace to a part of the world

572
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:33,535
that has known nothing but war
for generations.

573
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:37,943
That is the greater good
that I am working toward.

574
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,512
And to achieve it,
there have to be sacrifices!

575
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:42,616
With all due respect,

576
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,851
these people gave weapons to terrorists
who were willing to erase Manhattan!

577
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:47,728
You don't know that!

578
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:51,690
And I'm telling you,
we have to move on.

579
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:55,216
Even Hassan's widow
has picked up the torch

580
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:56,828
and is continuing this process.

581
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:59,124
Does she know the Russians
helped murder her husband?

582
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:01,612
Would she be willing
to sign that treaty if she knew that?

583
00:36:01,737 --> 00:36:03,358
- Have you even told her?
- Enough.

584
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:05,996
- Have you told her?
- I said that's enough!

585
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:13,158
This peace treaty
is in the interests

586
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:15,636
of the United States
and of the world.

587
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:19,051
That makes it a good in itself,
and certainly

588
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,308
more important
than your desire for revenge.

589
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:24,431
Madam President,
I don't want revenge, I want justice.

590
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:27,100
And I want peace.

591
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,436
If there were another way,
I would take it, but there's not.

592
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:34,026
That's my decision.

593
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:36,026
Do you understand?

594
00:36:39,703 --> 00:36:41,365
Do you understand, Jack?

595
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:53,168
I've arranged a helicopter
to fly you from CTU

596
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,837
to McGuire Air Force Base.

597
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,714
You're locking me down.

598
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:00,926
You'll be debriefed there.

599
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:06,433
Good-bye, Jack.

600
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:10,105
I'm sorry.

601
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:34,349
- I had them gather your things.
- Thanks.

602
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:35,929
- What happened?
- Nothing.

603
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,777
- What do you mean?
- I mean nothing.

604
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:40,252
Nothing happened.

605
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,536
What I need is a meeting
with Dalia Hassan

606
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:04,752
to coordinate our response
to the likely questions.

607
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:06,304
Will you set that up?

608
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:08,160
Thank you.

609
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,579
I'm leaving CTU now.
I'll be with you

610
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,064
in ten minutes.

611
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:15,500
They said you wanted to see me.

612
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:23,573
Dana Walsh is to remain locked down
until further notice.

613
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:26,694
No one gets access to her
without my express permission.

614
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,019
Is that clear?

615
00:38:28,866 --> 00:38:29,984
I guess.

616
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:31,141
What about Jack?

617
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:34,684
Jack is going to McGuire
Air Force Base to be debriefed.

618
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:37,781
He didn't seem very happy
about that.

619
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:40,705
He was disappointed I wouldn't grant

620
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,861
Walsh immunity
in exchange for her testimony.

621
00:38:44,237 --> 00:38:46,448
But Dana knows
who's responsible for today.

622
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,492
She is a sociopath.

623
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:51,043
She'll say anything.

624
00:38:51,702 --> 00:38:54,700
And the last thing we need right now
is a bunch of unfounded allegations

625
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:57,330
derailing the peace
that we've all worked so hard for.

626
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:58,855
Do you understand?

627
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:05,592
We're having a press conference
at the UN in two hours

628
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,613
to present Dalia Hassan
as the new leader of the IRK

629
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:11,024
and to announce that the peace talks
are still on track.

630
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,016
What we need CTU to do
is to make sure

631
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,154
security is airtight.

632
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:27,058
Tim Woods speaks very highly of you.

633
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,660
When the situation got out of control,
he was adamant that you were the one

634
00:39:31,957 --> 00:39:33,107
to take over.

635
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,039
I'm surprised
he even knows who I am.

636
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:40,419
It was a pleasure
to meet you finally, Chloe.

637
00:39:41,414 --> 00:39:42,414
Thank you.

638
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,146
Cole, we're gonna be back
on UN detail.

639
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:03,900
- What's happening with Dana?
- As of now, nothing.

640
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,319
- The immunity agreement?
- There won't be any.

641
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,572
Why not?

642
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,898
The president says
Dana's a lying sociopath

643
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:11,873
who will wreck the peace treaty.

644
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:14,376
- What's Jack say about that?
- I don't know.

645
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:17,126
He's being choppered to McGuire
for debriefing.

646
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:20,042
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

647
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:23,670
There will be a press conference soon,
it's up to us to guarantee security.

648
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:26,227
You'll need to get your teams ready.

649
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,367
So Jack's being taken away
for a debrief?

650
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:52,908
- About what, may I ask?
- No.

651
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,452
<i>Director O'Brian,
this is Falcon One.</i>

652
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,733
- <i>We're touching down at CTU.</i>
- Copy that.

653
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,665
Security personnel en route to the roof
with Jack Bauer.

654
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:24,481
Mr. Bauer, Agent Winnick.

655
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,191
I have to escort you

656
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,217
to McGuire Air Force Base
for a debrief.

657
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,910
Heard a lot about you, sir.

658
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:41,367
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

659
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:43,360
There's no reason to be sorry.

660
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,950
I'm taking this helicopter.

661
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:56,263
Tell your men to drop their weapons
or you'll die.

662
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:04,480
Arlo, pull up the audio.
Something's happening.

663
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,438
Coming up.

664
00:42:06,095 --> 00:42:07,702
<i>Put your weapons down now!</i>

665
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:09,062
<i>I will kill him!</i>

666
00:42:09,187 --> 00:42:12,373
All security to the helipad now.

667
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:15,574
- What's going on?
- He's gonna steal that helicopter.

668
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,283
Out of the copter now!

669
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,707
<i>Bauer took a hostage.
Hijacking the helicopter.</i>

670
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,506
Hold your fire!
Lower your weapons!

671
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,885
Give me your walkie.

672
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:38,722
<i>Land the chopper now.</i>

673
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:44,311
You know I have to call this in.
The Air Force will force you down.

674
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,688
This is a bad idea.
Land the chopper

675
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:47,937
<i>now.</i>

676
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,903
Call the FAA, the Air Force.
Tell them we have a stolen helicopter

677
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,051
flying west over Manhattan that needs
to be intercepted and forced down.
