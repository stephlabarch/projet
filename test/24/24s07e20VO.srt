00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,047
GALVEZ:
You want me to blow up
a couple of dozen FBI agents?

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:18,782
You got a problem with that?

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,517
<i>JACK:
Agent Walker, this is Jack.</i>

7
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,386
Get your men out of the
building-- it's a trap.

8
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:23,954
(beeping)

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,258
You got the
canister?

10
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,629
Clearly, Hodges
is behind this.

11
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:33,397
I want him taken
to the FBI

12
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:34,598
for interrogation.

13
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,932
He's a sociopath, Mom.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,401
He's not going to talk--
he's going to want

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,570
to make some kind of deal
in exchange for his cooperation.

16
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,705
Mom, you're not
considering that.
Olivia...

17
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,275
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

18
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:46,810
I've upset the cart, have I?

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,612
CARA:
That bioweapon that
you developed

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,781
for us was not intended
for personal use.

21
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,915
I think we can
both agree

22
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,751
that there's no reason
for your family

23
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:55,118
to pay for
your mistakes.

24
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:56,987
This will induce
a cardiac arrest

25
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,622
and leave no trace
in your system.

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,861
(tires screeching)

27
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:07,864
We are rerouting
to West Arlington Hospital.

28
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:10,100
Have you heard from Almeida?

29
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:12,002
<i>CARA:
I called him before I met
with Hodges.</i>

30
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,804
Has he secured the canister?

31
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:14,805
Soon.
He's your guy.

32
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:16,106
He better not screw this up.

33
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:18,342
<i>I have faith
he'll come through.</i>

34
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:20,711
Why don't you go back
to FBI Medical

35
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,946
and let them
treat you?

36
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,448
There is no treatment.

37
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:25,882
There is no cure.

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,217
Almost like
they knew, Jack.

39
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,218
They would have
needed time

40
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,320
to wire this building
with explosives.

41
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:31,087
This is the last sector
we were due to search.

42
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,790
Jack, what is it?

43
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:35,426
What is your involvement?

44
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:36,627
You're not thinking straight.

45
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:38,662
The toxin's starting
to affect your judgment.

46
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,631
Now, why don't you
put the gun down.
Don't you move!

47
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,269
I never wanted to
hurt you, Jack.

48
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:47,805
I told you to stay out of it.

49
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:48,905
We get some help here?

50
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,507
This man's having a seizure.

51
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,209
MACER:
Mr. Bauer, you should be
feeling better already.

52
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:21,345
I'm giving you five cc's
of intravenous pendopamine.

53
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:22,612
It'll de-constrict
your muscles.

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,780
Just hang in there.

55
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:24,848
(strained gibbering)

56
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:25,916
Don't talk.

57
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:27,684
Your vocal cords
are in spasm.

58
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,053
What the hell happened?

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,421
Tony Almeida found him
in full seizure.

60
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:31,855
What about the medication
pack you gave him?

61
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,223
Wasn't carrying it.

62
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,525
S-s-stop.

63
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:35,992
Mr. Bauer,
please don't speak.

64
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,061
Stop...

65
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,262
Tony...

66
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,396
Tony?

67
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:40,697
I don't understand.

68
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,933
He's... second man.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,868
Jack, what...
Put out an APB.

70
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,403
How do you
know this?

71
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,238
Do it!

72
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,307
Attention, all patrols
and perimeter teams,

73
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,475
this is Alpha One.

74
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,544
I'm issuing a priority APB
on Tony Almeida.

75
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,744
Approach with extreme caution.

76
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:55,912
He's colluding with Galvez
(gun firing)

77
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,980
and should be
considered hostile.

78
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:58,348
All units who engage the suspect

79
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,017
should do so
with extreme caution.

80
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,038
(grunting)

81
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:25,709
You really need to give yourself
more time to recover.

82
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:27,211
Here's another med pack.

83
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:28,778
Make sure he doesn't lose it.

84
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:31,482
I need to go tend
to the other wounded.

85
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:35,652
All right, tell me what
the hell is going on.

86
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:41,758
Tony was working with Galvez
all along.

87
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,794
He used us, all of us,
so that he

88
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,163
could get to the canister.

89
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:47,964
So, wait, what
are you saying,

90
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:49,500
that...

91
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:52,236
Tony killed Larry?

92
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:54,771
Yeah.

93
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,406
They must have
ambushed him

94
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:58,242
as the chopper
was setting down.

95
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:01,478
Tony stayed behind so he
could monitor our search,

96
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:03,313
set the trap
and make sure Galvez

97
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:04,515
could get beyond
the perimeter.

98
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,116
Oh, God.

99
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:07,851
I'm so sorry.

100
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,321
This is my fault.

101
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,491
I vouched for him to you,
to the president.

102
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:20,297
I made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

103
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:22,065
I felt that something
was wrong.g.

104
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,500
Things weren't adding up.

105
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:25,202
I just...

106
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,539
I just wanted to believe him.

107
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,974
Alpha One, this is Agent Kilner.

108
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,609
Alpha One-- go ahead.

109
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:35,245
Agent Walker,
I'm at checkpoint Delta.

110
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:37,281
I've got two agents dead,
shot point-blank.

111
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:38,515
Their vehicle
is missing.

112
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,284
Okay, he's made it
past the perimeter.

113
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:42,886
Tracking on the vehicle has been
disabled-- position is unknown.

114
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,888
Widen the perimeter,
and keep looking for Almeida.

115
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,723
If we lose him,
we lose the canister.

116
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,991
Copy that.

117
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,294
You're not gonna find him--
he's gone.

118
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:51,961
We need to phone the president.

119
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,163
Let's go.

120
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:15,519
??

121
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:36,773
You made it.

122
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:38,342
You sound surprised.

123
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,278
After Bauer called you out,
I wasn't sure you would.

124
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,482
You don't have to worry
about Jack Bauer.

125
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,718
He's not gonna
be a problem.

126
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:51,855
So, where is the canister?

127
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:54,157
Where's the money?

128
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:58,328
Hey, that was our agreement.

129
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:00,196
Money first.

130
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:09,573
There you go.

131
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:12,476
It's all there,
wired into your account.

132
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:15,078
You can check
it if you want.

133
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:17,213
I want.

134
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:27,957
Everything okay?

135
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:29,493
Yeah.

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,127
So, where is the canister?

137
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,467
Right here.

138
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,844
So, what are you planning
on doing with it?

139
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:49,913
Not really your
business, is it?
(zipping)

140
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,848
You gonna sell it?

141
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:03,593
You don't want to do this.

142
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,495
Hey, who's the damn buyer?

143
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,767
(gun firing)

144
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:20,844
(grunting)

145
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:27,784
Where's the canister?

146
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:29,586
Where is the
damn canister?!

147
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:33,990
One of the marines
that was guarding Hodges

148
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:35,959
noticed he was trying
to swallow something.

149
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,561
He intervened, got
him to the hospital

150
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,763
before the poison could
be completely ingested.

151
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,164
So, he'll survive?

152
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:42,899
Yes, ma'am, but
the doctors

153
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,434
are surprised he
pulled through.

154
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:46,670
That's because they never met
the son of a bitch.

155
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,405
How did Hodges get this poison?

156
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:51,274
We suspect from a woman
who claimed to be his attorney.

157
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:52,342
Claimed to be?

158
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,643
She was an
impostor.

159
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,812
DC Police found the body
of Hodges' real attorney

160
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
about five minutes ago.

161
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,147
We're still trying
to determine

162
00:07:58,215 --> 00:07:59,883
how she managed to
breach security.
(beeping)

163
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,151
WOMAN (over intercom):
Madam President, Agent Walker
and Jack Bauer.

164
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,720
Put them through.

165
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,590
This is President Taylor.

166
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:07,891
I'm here with Tim Woods.

167
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:08,992
RENEE:
Madam President...

168
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:10,727
Have you secured the canister?

169
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,095
I'm afraid
not, ma'am.

170
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:13,930
Our suspect escaped
beyond the perimeter.

171
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:16,433
I was told that the area
was locked down.

172
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:17,567
What happened?

173
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:19,436
He had help, Madam President.

174
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:20,837
From Tony Almeida.

175
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:22,539
Almeida?

176
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:23,774
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,375
He was working for us.

178
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:26,777
It only appeared
that way.

179
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:28,545
Apparently, he was
pursuing his own agenda,

180
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,179
trying to get his hands
on the canister.

181
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,081
Madam President, I know
I vouched for him.

182
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,650
All I can tell you
right now

183
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:35,351
is that I was wrong
and I'm sorry.

184
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,653
Now that we know he
has the canister,

185
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,588
do we have any idea what
he intends to do with it?

186
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:40,590
No, not yet.
Or where he is?

187
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:42,025
We're all hands
on deck here, sir,

188
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,393
regrouping to
develop leads.

189
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:46,062
I may have one.

190
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,164
As Hodges was taken
into custody,

191
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,366
he yelled at me
about some larger group

192
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,536
that would continue on
after his arrest.

193
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:54,571
Something that I wouldn't
be able to stop.

194
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,972
What do you think
he meant?

195
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,273
Well, all I know
for sure

196
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,208
is that someone doesn't
want Hodges to talk.

197
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:00,677
Shortly after he
was arrested,

198
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:01,878
Hodges was visited

199
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,513
by a woman impersonating
his lawyer.

200
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:05,816
She apparently gave him
some kind of lethal drug,

201
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:07,116
because ten
minutes later,

202
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:08,217
he tried to
commit suicide.

203
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,019
<i>Tried to commit
suicide?</i>

204
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,588
Oh, he's still alive.

205
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:14,223
Jonas Hodges was
completely unrepentant.

206
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,060
Now, this suicide attempt
must have been coerced.

207
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:18,094
Well, obviously,
they're holding something

208
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:19,295
over him, most likely
his family.

209
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:20,497
If that's the case,
Madam President,

210
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,765
we need to talk to him.

211
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,501
Jack, even after everything
that's happened today,

212
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:27,704
I will not allow any kind
of coercive interrogation.

213
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,806
Madam President, that
won't be necessary.

214
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,374
He'll talk.
How can you be sure?

215
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,443
Because we can offer Hodges
something that he needs.

216
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,744
And what's that?

217
00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:36,480
Proof of death:
we can convince the people

218
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:37,948
that wanted him dead
that they succeeded.

219
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,416
It's the only way Hodges
can protect his family.

220
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:41,885
Madam President,
right now,

221
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:43,487
he's the only
lead we've got.

222
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:55,499
Hey.

223
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:04,140
I'll assume that
was necessary.

224
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,675
Don't start with me.

225
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,443
I'm not in the mood.

226
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,945
All right.

227
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,148
Mr. Galvez decided

228
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,884
to hide the canister from me,

229
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:17,086
so, uh, I had to find out
where it was.

230
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:22,025
We've got a
delivery to make.

231
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:23,292
Shall we go?

232
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,028
No, I don't think we should.

233
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,230
They're expecting us.

234
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,566
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

235
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:32,903
they're gonna take this canister
that I sweated blood for

236
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,438
and sit on it for six months.

237
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:36,706
Not sit on it.

238
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:38,341
They're gonna use it
to make more pathogen.

239
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,376
We had 27 canisters;
now we have one.

240
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:42,045
Yeah, and I say one's enough.

241
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:45,782
Look... (sighs)

242
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,852
the government's reeling.

243
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,754
The FBI is stretched thin--

244
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,188
scrambling, making mistakes.

245
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,223
Another attack today
is all we need

246
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,192
to push this thing
right over the edge.

247
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,029
This is no time to pull back.

248
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,632
I say we take that canister,

249
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,801
and finish the job off today.

250
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,207
I don't disagree
with you

251
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,443
but it's not
our decision to make.

252
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,846
Fine.

253
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:18,014
Then run it by your group

254
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,984
or your gang or whatever
the hell they are.

255
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:22,418
But they'll know one thing.

256
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:24,921
You finish your enemy off
when he's down.

257
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:26,790
You don't let him
get back up and reload.

258
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,725
I guarantee you,
this thing's gonna be

259
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,393
a hell of a lot harder

260
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:32,095
to pull off six
months from now.

261
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:35,264
And you can say what
you want about Jonas Hodges,

262
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,266
the fact is,

263
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,235
he gave us an opportunity today.

264
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,840
Let's take it.

265
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,147
I'll contact the group.

266
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:54,183
Good.

267
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:11,452
What did she say exactly?

268
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,221
Only that she needs to see you

269
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:14,488
and that it's urgent.

270
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:16,490
I heard rumors
about the FBI operation.

271
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:18,359
I'm sure your mother
will fill you in, ma'am.

272
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:19,961
(knocking on door)

273
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,663
Olivia.

274
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,699
Is it true the
FBI perimeter was breached?

275
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm afraid so.

276
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,468
The canister is now
outside the cordon.

277
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:28,970
What are we doing
to get it back?

278
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:31,206
Tim, would you
excuse us for a moment?

279
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,773
Of course.

280
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:41,816
What is it?

281
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:44,319
I need you to call
the Attorney General

282
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:47,655
and draft a witness protection
agreement for Jonas Hodges.

283
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,291
Witness protection?

284
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,759
You can't be serious.

285
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:53,962
Less than an hour ago,

286
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,130
Hodges tried to kill himself.

287
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,466
And we all believe that
he must've been coerced.

288
00:12:58,533 --> 00:12:59,667
By whom?

289
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,602
You remember his rant--

290
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,038
that he is a cog
in a larger conspiracy,

291
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:05,673
that there are others
who will carry on.

292
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,309
You think they're the ones
who took the canister?

293
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:09,510
Well, we need
to find out.

294
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:12,080
Which is why we need
to get Hodges to talk.

295
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:15,449
Olivia, we feel
confident that he will

296
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,718
if we can assure him that
these people will believe

297
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:20,255
that his suicide attempt
actually succeeded.

298
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:22,757
We need to make
him disappear.

299
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:25,093
Which is why I need
the protection agreement.

300
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,961
There is no other way
he'll talk.

301
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,763
Designate him
an enemy combatant,

302
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,931
then treat him like one.

303
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,366
We don't do that.

304
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:32,800
Not in this administration.

305
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:35,870
And it's not as if he's
getting a free pass.

306
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:36,871
He'll be under
federal supervision

307
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:37,872
for the rest of his life.

308
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,040
Oh, yeah,

309
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:40,841
on a hundred acre
ranch in Colorado!

310
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:46,247
This man murdered your son!

311
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:51,619
My brother.

312
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:52,787
Not to mention

313
00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:54,755
hundreds of
innocent civilians.

314
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:56,824
I don't need you
to tell me what he's done.

315
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:57,926
Apparently you do.

316
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:59,460
Olivia, stop it!

317
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:00,828
What would Dad say?

318
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,063
I bet you're afraid to ask.

319
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:04,632
I said stop!

320
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:11,172
Do you think that
this is easy for me?

321
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,409
You think it doesn't
tear me apart?

322
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:19,447
I'm Roger's mother.

323
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:26,354
But I am also the President
of the United States

324
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:28,189
and I placed my hand on a Bible

325
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,224
and swore to protect and defend
the Constitution.

326
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:31,292
You

327
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
are my Chief
of Staff.

328
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,529
I need you
to act like one.

329
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,467
Now, Jonas Hodges

330
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:42,303
is at the FBI, and Jack Bauer
will be there shortly.

331
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,205
I need an agreement drafted.

332
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,242
Do that please.

333
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:52,580
(sighs)

334
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,582
The plan is
straightforward--

335
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,250
an attack today
this morning

336
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,086
during rush hour
using the bioweapon

337
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:00,421
that Tony Almeida retrieved
from Starkwood.

338
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:02,256
You should have each received
a data pack

339
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:03,757
when you logged on to this call.

340
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:05,526
Please open it now.

341
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:08,029
The attack will be attributed
to this man,

342
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:10,031
Jibraan Al-Zarian--

343
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,233
whose body will be left
at the scene.

344
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:13,901
The evidence trail
implicating him

345
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,569
will include fabricated e-mails,

346
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,804
phone records,

347
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,906
and a large wire transfer
to his account

348
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:20,674
via our favorite Yemini bank.

349
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:22,710
I'm looking
at the briefing materials

350
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:24,879
and I'm not seeing how this man
is actually connected

351
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:26,280
to any terrorist group.

352
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:27,615
He isn't.

353
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:28,883
As previously discussed,

354
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,718
there are considerable
tactical advantages

355
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,053
to using an innocent.

356
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:33,621
But what about
his unpredictability?

357
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,756
Al-Zarian has no agenda
of his own.

358
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:38,893
He'll in fact be easier
to control and manipulate

359
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,895
than a real terrorist.
So what are

360
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:42,897
the casualty estimates?

361
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:45,733
Page three describes
the casualties estimates

362
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,101
as well as secondary effects.

363
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:48,836
As you can see, we've listed...
Hold on.

364
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:49,937
Forget about

365
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,572
what casualties may
or may not be.

366
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,741
We're talking about launching
a new operation

367
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,243
in the next few hours.

368
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,710
Without any planning.

369
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:58,279
And with only one canister.

370
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:00,814
WOMAN:
The plan for this operation
was already in place.

371
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:02,616
We'd just be accelerating
the timetable.

372
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,352
We were going to have six months
to prepare.

373
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,620
There's no way to pull it
together in a few hours.

374
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:08,256
I believe there is.

375
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:10,258
With the support of this group.

376
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:11,426
MAN:
Support for whom?

377
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:13,227
This Tony Almeida
we barely know?

378
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:14,595
And what about postattack plans?

379
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:15,996
How's this

380
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,433
group going to end up
where we need to be?
(beep)

381
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,535
MAN 2:
I agree. How we handle
ourselves politically

382
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:22,570
in the aftermath of this event

383
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:24,638
is just as important
as the attack itself.

384
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:25,806
WOMAN:
It always has been.

385
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:26,974
MAN:
In your opinion,

386
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,642
is there time then to achieve

387
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,778
all our objectives
in the current scenario?

388
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,580
WOMAN:
Not with the same level
of certainty.

389
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:33,981
MAN 2:
Or anonymity.

390
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:35,249
WOMAN:
That's right.

391
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,518
MAN:
Well, then, maybe it's,
uh, definitive.

392
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:38,586
WOMAN:
What do you mean?

393
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:39,987
MAN:
There's no downside to waiting.

394
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,022
There's a huge downside
to going in unprepared.

395
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:44,459
Things go wrong,

396
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,461
we're looking at exposure--

397
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:47,861
for all of us.

398
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:50,030
MAN 2:
No, no, I still don't see it
that way.

399
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:52,032
Gentlemen.

400
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,068
Ladies.

401
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:56,237
I've listened to your comments

402
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:58,272
and there's wisdom

403
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,708
in what I've heard.

404
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:03,344
But there's also wisdom in
something I haven't heard.

405
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:05,346
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,

406
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:07,948
and the group
is well rid of him.

407
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:10,985
But, in his lunacy,
he did us a favor.

408
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:13,887
He did half our job for us.

409
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,889
More than half.

410
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,459
He pushed this country
to the brink.

411
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:22,363
You don't get many gifts
like that.

412
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:25,399
I say we take it.

413
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:29,003
We have a quorum,

414
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,205
I'd like to call
for an immediate vote.

415
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,455
Tony.

416
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,393
How'd it go?

417
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,462
Take a look.

418
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:03,771
We're a go.

419
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:33,653
Where's Hodges now?
Down the hall.

420
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,655
We've set up a medical
suite in Secure Z.

421
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:37,157
And the death
certificate?

422
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,525
Done.

423
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,560
As far as the world knows,
he's molding on a slab

424
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:42,562
at the coroner's.
Keep it that way.

425
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,064
No one knows
he's alive

426
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:45,933
unless they have to.
No, just
the ambulance driver,

427
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,367
the medical team
and three security.

428
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:48,535
All trustworthy.

429
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:49,569
Wait.

430
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:51,004
Are you sure he's up for this?

431
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:52,139
I know what happened out there.

432
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:53,473
Medication worked.
He'll be okay.

433
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,774
I'm not talking
about the seizure.

434
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,776
I'm talking about
the Tony Almeida situation.

435
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,211
What about it?

436
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,280
His former partner betrays him,

437
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,714
he tries
to have you all killed--

438
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,117
Jack must have some feelings
about that.

439
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,618
Yeah.

440
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,687
Yeah, I think it's what's
keeping him going.

441
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,558
Listen to me.

442
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,892
Listen to me.

443
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,894
Is anyone listening?

444
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:15,895
I know you're watching.

445
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:17,897
I see the cameras!

446
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:19,632
I know you're watching.

447
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,135
Do you realize
what you people have done?

448
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,170
You didn't save me,

449
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:25,005
you killed my family!

450
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:26,273
You killed my family!

451
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,008
You killed them!

452
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:29,109
Killed them.
How long

453
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:30,677
has he been
conscious?
Ten minutes.

454
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:33,513
He's been talking about
his family ever since.

455
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:34,914
Biometrics are
over here.

456
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:36,716
Cardiac, respiratory,
plus dermal infrared.

457
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,285
Good. We'll know
if he's lying.

458
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:40,287
Jack,

459
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,155
the president is
monitoring this.

460
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,657
Sergeant, I'm asking you,

461
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,826
soldier to soldier,
let me have your firearm.

462
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,997
I'll use one...
one bullet on myself.

463
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,031
Please.

464
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:52,432
JACK:
Relax, Mr. Hodges.

465
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,002
You're already dead.

466
00:19:58,006 --> 00:20:00,007
Sergeant.

467
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,111
Who are you?

468
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:05,645
My name is Jack Bauer.

469
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,680
And right now,
I'm the only chance

470
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,017
your wife and children
have to stay alive.

471
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,052
Explain that to me.

472
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,388
The people that wanted you dead
don't know you survived.

473
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:15,455
Tell us who they are,

474
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,324
and we'll keep
it that way.

475
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,226
JACK:
The President has agreed
to provide you with a death

476
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,395
certificate and witness
protection in exchange

477
00:20:21,462 --> 00:20:23,397
for actionable information.

478
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:25,032
I can't watch this anymore.

479
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,400
If you refuse, it'll be released

480
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,735
to the press that you are alive
and in our custody

481
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,003
and that you're cooperating.

482
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,139
We'll let your friends
take care of the rest.

483
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:34,141
My family is innocent.

484
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,709
The president would never
allow that to happen.

485
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,379
She doesn't have
the stomach for it.

486
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,448
JACK:
You might be right about that.

487
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:44,684
But make no mistake
about it, sir.

488
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:46,953
I do.

489
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,057
Trust me.

490
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,658
Do your family a favor.

491
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:54,727
Just tell me who you've
been working with.

492
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:02,102
I am--

493
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,604
I was--

494
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:06,940
part of a larger group
of like minds.

495
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,276
You mean, other companies
like Starkwood.

496
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:11,010
I mean people who can
protect this country

497
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,546
better than any
government ever could.

498
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:14,381
JACK:
There are hundreds of private
military companies

499
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:15,582
in this country, we're talking

500
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,217
tens of thousands of people.

501
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:18,585
But only a handful

502
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,721
with the guts and the vision
to do what was necessary.

503
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:22,889
And what is that?

504
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:25,258
The plan was to launch
simultaneous attacks

505
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,726
early next year.

506
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:27,760
Multiple cities.

507
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,262
So the public would finally see

508
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,763
that the government
can't protect them.

509
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,200
They'd demand drastic measures
and we'd step in.

510
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:35,202
How would you justify that
to the American people?

511
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,369
Simple.

512
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:37,704
Offload the blame.

513
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:39,139
We were going to supply
the enemies

514
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:40,873
that want to destroy
this country.

515
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,609
Muhammed this,
Achmed that.

516
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,112
From sleeper cells the
apologists say don't even exist.

517
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,113
You of all people

518
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,614
should understand.

519
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,982
Understand what?

520
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,151
I watched the Senate
hearing yesterday,

521
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:54,154
and I was disgusted
with how you were treated.

522
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:56,156
You should be regarded
as a hero,

523
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:58,992
not a criminal.

524
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,961
I broke the law.

525
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,930
You were
following

526
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:07,066
your instinct to protect
your country, just like me.

527
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:08,368
Mr. Hodges, I need the names

528
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:10,069
of the people
that you are working with.

529
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:12,439
I have spent my entire life
protecting this country

530
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,674
from enemies large and small.

531
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:16,709
I created Starkwood
from the ground up.

532
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,645
And the government
used us to great effect.

533
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,047
And now they think
they can just throw us away.

534
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:22,982
Are you telling me
that this has been

535
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,451
about protecting your
contracts, about money?

536
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:27,587
I tried to tell the politicians
how vulnerable we are,

537
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:29,055
and they wouldn't listen.

538
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:30,624
So we decided
to show them.

539
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:33,627
JACK:
By attacking your own country
with a biological weapon?

540
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:35,228
By killing
innocent people?

541
00:22:35,296 --> 00:22:38,064
Yes, a few innocent lives
would be lost,

542
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:40,033
but only to save
the greater number.

543
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,535
Having the courage
to make those hard choices

544
00:22:41,602 --> 00:22:43,002
gives us a lot in common,
Mr. Bauer.

545
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,272
Let me explain something to you.

546
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,708
You and I have absolutely
nothing in common.

547
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:51,344
All that you have done today
is create a scenario

548
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,646
by attacking your own country

549
00:22:52,713 --> 00:22:54,214
that has made you valuable
again.

550
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:55,715
Today has been
nothing short

551
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,350
of a desperate
grab for power,

552
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,485
and it has failed.

553
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,019
<i>You have failed,
and unless</i>

554
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,188
you want me to go public

555
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,455
with the fact that
you are still alive,

556
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:03,756
you are gonna
give me the names

557
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:05,225
of the people that
you've been working with.

558
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:06,493
I-I don't have them.
I want the names.

559
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,495
I don't have any.
I want the names!

560
00:23:08,563 --> 00:23:10,330
I don't know any!

561
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:13,733
Fine.

562
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,975
(beep)

563
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:25,412
<i>Patch me through to Amy Meyer
at the Washington Post.</i>

564
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,214
No.

565
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,583
Amy, it's Jack. I have
a statement I need to make.

566
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,817
Wait!

567
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:32,985
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!
Give me the names!

568
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:35,088
I swear... I swear
I don't have them.

569
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:37,156
This whole project was...
was based on anonymity.

570
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:38,558
We never met in person.

571
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,660
Everything was handled through
an intermediary, a woman.

572
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,028
She never told
me who she was.

573
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,196
She never told
me her name.

574
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:44,364
I never asked her.

575
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:45,998
The same woman
that gave you the poison?

576
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,101
Yes, yes.

577
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,106
(rapping on glass)

578
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,812
Amy, I'm sorry.
Something's come up.

579
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,381
I've got to call you back.

580
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:03,550
(panting)

581
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,585
You tell yourself
whatever you want.

582
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,354
You are a traitor.

583
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:10,557
Witness Protection
was your promise.

584
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,492
Yeah.

585
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,696
Madam President,
did you hear everything

586
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,164
that Hodges had to say?

587
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:20,533
Yes. Is any of it even credible?

588
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,369
All of it is.
Biometric monitors here indicate

589
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:23,737
that he was telling the truth.

590
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,305
Whoever they are,
this group just went

591
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:26,673
through an awful
lot of trouble

592
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:28,441
to get their hands
on that last canister.

593
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,077
It seems very clear to me
that their plan is still on.

594
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,712
You mean
another attack?
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,514
I think you should proceed
under the assumption

596
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:35,615
that they might
strike immediately.

597
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,783
Hold on.

598
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,217
Hodges said some
time next year.

599
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:39,919
<i>No. Hodges said
that was the plan.</i>

600
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:42,489
Given the chaos
that he created today,

601
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:44,591
the smart strategic move
would be to act right now.

602
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,726
Now, I believe the canister
is still in this area,

603
00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:48,227
so we're gonna have
to alert Homeland,

604
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:49,729
have them start identifying
and raiding targets.

605
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:51,030
Hodges said
that the plan was

606
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:52,332
to enlist parties
with terrorist ties.

607
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,967
At this point, I think that
might be our most solid lead.

608
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,503
Madam President, I
agree with Agent Walker.

609
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,237
We need to make
an immediate threat assessment

610
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:00,674
with focus on all known
terrorist activity.

611
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:02,642
The fastest way
for us to get that information

612
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,644
is to gain access
to the CTU servers

613
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,379
that have been sealed
as a result

614
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:08,047
of Senator Mayer's
investigation.

615
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:11,184
I'll have them
recommissioned immediately.

616
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,119
And consider the resources
of this government

617
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:15,188
at your disposal, Jack.

618
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:17,256
Thank you, ma'am.

619
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:18,658
I need those servers
right away.

620
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,593
They're in DOJ evidence
lockers on the third floor.

621
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:21,961
I'll have I.T.
break them out.

622
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,330
Okay, good.

623
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,798
We have a new shift
of analysts coming in,

624
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:26,733
if you can tell them
what you're looking for.

625
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,000
No, we don't
have time.

626
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,669
We need someone
who already knows the protocols.

627
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,837
I'll take care of it.

628
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,505
Just get me
those servers.

629
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:44,116
(phone ringing)

630
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:51,691
Who is it?

631
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,827
Hey, it's me Jack.

632
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,829
Jack, where the hell are you?

633
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:57,364
The FBI headquarters.

634
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,898
I've been trying
to reach you all night.

635
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:00,166
No one will
tell me anything.

636
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:02,201
Is it true about Bill?

637
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:06,439
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

638
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,844
(sighs)

639
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,014
What happened?

640
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,684
He was killed during
the White House siege.

641
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:19,753
Chloe, you should know,

642
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,589
Bill sacrificed his life
to save the president.

643
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:23,956
Listen to me.

644
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,692
This threat is not over.

645
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,959
We believe that there's going

646
00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:29,228
to be a biological attack
somewhere in the area.

647
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,464
Soon. I need your help
to stop it.

648
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:32,999
How?

649
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:35,535
I need you
to reconstitute the CTU servers.

650
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:37,236
They were seized
when the CTU was decommissioned.

651
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,505
I don't have access to them.

652
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:40,774
You will
by the time you get here.

653
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,342
Who's doing this?

654
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,911
We don't have all the players.

655
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,548
I'll fill you in with as much
as I know when you get here.

656
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:51,951
I'm sending a car
over to your hotel.

657
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:56,923
Chloe?

658
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,991
(sniffles)

659
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,295
Send a car.

660
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:04,363
Thank you.

661
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,610
(sniffles)

662
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:38,331
Morris, wake up.

663
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:40,600
What? Are you speaking
to me again now?

664
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:41,935
I have to go.

665
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:43,402
I need you to take Prescott
and get out of the city.

666
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:45,137
Why?
I just spoke
with Jack.

667
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,139
There's going to
be another attack.

668
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,641
This time, it's biological.

669
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,077
Okay, then we'll all get out
of here together.

670
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:53,179
I can't.
FBI needs me.

671
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:55,748
But the last time
you worked for these people,

672
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:57,149
they arrested you.

673
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,651
I know.

674
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,954
But I'm the only one that can
get the servers back online.

675
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,356
Well, I'm not gonna
leave you here.

676
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:07,494
Not with the possibility
of a biological attack.

677
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,267
Please.

678
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:18,070
I'm the only one
that can do this.

679
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:19,806
And Jack needs me.

680
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:23,342
And I just need for you
and Prescott to be safe.

681
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,812
Okay?

682
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,014
I'll see you
back at home.

683
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,718
Just... be careful.

684
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:35,788
I will.

685
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:16,403
RENEE:
All right, before we
begin, everyone make sure

686
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:18,072
you have your updated
briefing packets,

687
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,908
and the latest
CDC abstract.

688
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,509
Jack, whenever
you're ready.

689
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:24,912
Thank you.

690
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,783
I know many of you have lost
friends and colleagues today.

691
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:31,418
I have, too.

692
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:33,520
Unfortunately, the time to mourn
these brave men and women

693
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:34,789
is going to have to wait.

694
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,891
'Cause, as many of you
are already aware,

695
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,293
we are facing the threat
of a terrorist event

696
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,594
somewhere on the
Eastern seaboard.

697
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,062
We don't have specific intel

698
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,397
as to the time table
of this attack,

699
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:45,166
but we do have
reason to believe that

700
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:47,935
the people that are behind this
will want to strike immediately.

701
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,103
Excuse me.

702
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:50,337
Tim Moran, field ops.

703
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:52,072
Who are the people behind this?

704
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,474
Right now, we only have
two confirmed suspects.

705
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,642
(computer chimes)

706
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,811
Tony Almeida

707
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,545
and the woman
he's been working with.

708
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:00,080
We're still trying
to identify her.

709
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:02,817
The assumption is,
the two of them are
part of a broader

710
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,751
conspiracy as outlined
in your briefing material.

711
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,320
And the nature of the attack?

712
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,922
All it says here is biological.

713
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,590
The actual pathogen is a prion
variant, designed to attack

714
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:12,793
the central nervous system
and ultimately destroy it.

715
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:14,228
Do we know what the target is?

716
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,063
No, not yet.
We're also unclear

717
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:17,832
on the specifics
of the delivery device.

718
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,933
Well, what leads do we have?

719
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,201
Right now,

720
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,303
we are solely working
off an operational theory

721
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,071
that the people
that are behind this

722
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:25,339
will need
to manufacture evidence

723
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,374
in an effort to offload
the blame for this attack

724
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:28,809
to either another group
or an individual

725
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:29,977
with terrorist sympathies.

726
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,312
During the ensuing panic,

727
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,447
these people will move in
and seize power

728
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:36,416
under the guise of creating
and maintaining stability.

729
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:38,819
So, our job here is
to look for traces

730
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:39,887
of that manufactured
evidence.

731
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:41,255
How exactly?

732
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,924
Pattern searches of suspicious
financial transactions.

733
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,260
Keyword intercepts
of existing wiretaps,

734
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:47,427
websites and e-mails.

735
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:48,595
And data-mining all

736
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:50,364
NSA and CIA intelligence

737
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,866
on jihadist activities
over the past six months.

738
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,167
JANIS:
Excuse me.

739
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:56,570
Not only is that type
of blanket surveillance illegal.

740
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,205
We don't have the capacity
to pull it off.

741
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,373
The search algorithms

742
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,508
simply
don't exist.
Yes, they do.

743
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,244
At CTU.
Those servers
were decommissioned.

744
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:04,444
Not anymore. They're here.

745
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:06,446
We're in the process
of installing them now.

746
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,384
Well, what does that make us,
CTU-lite?

747
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,586
Last I heard,
the Bureau was

748
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:15,256
a federal entity
bound by federal statute.

749
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:17,258
Janis, do this or I will find
someone else who will.

750
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,525
I do not have time to argue.

751
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,027
I'm not arguing.
I'm asking.

752
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:21,561
Moving on.

753
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,465
(panting)

754
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,869
I've got her
from here. Thanks.

755
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:30,737
Jack.
Hey.

756
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,675
Thanks for coming.

757
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:36,843
You look like hell.

758
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,412
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

759
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,579
You don't look fine.

760
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,747
Maybe a little tired.

761
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,682
Did you get the report
I sent you?

762
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,584
Yeah. I read it
on the way over.

763
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,253
It's terrifying.
How real is this?
Real.

764
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,755
We're getting access to
the CTU servers, right?

765
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,057
Yeah. They're coming
online now.

766
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,358
Shouldn't I be
supervising this?

767
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:52,626
Yeah. Look,

768
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:53,794
there's something I need

769
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:55,595
to talk to you about
before we get started.

770
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,598
There's no easy way
for me to say this.

771
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,302
But Tony's been responsible
for these attacks.

772
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,471
That's not possible.

773
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,473
He was using you
and Bill all along.

774
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,641
He's really been working

775
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,443
for a group
of private military firms

776
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,945
trying to destabilize
this country

777
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,512
in an effort
to seize power.

778
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,914
So far today,

779
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,550
his actions have cost the lives
of hundreds of people.

780
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,218
But he's threatening
thousands more.

781
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:20,254
It doesn't make any sense.

782
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,957
I know he was devastated
over Michelle, but...

783
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,658
Chloe, he's not your friend.

784
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:28,095
The Tony that you knew--
he doesn't exist anymore.

785
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,663
There has to
be a reason.

786
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,131
A reason for what?

787
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,133
Bringing down
two passenger planes?

788
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,802
Trying to ambush
25 federal agents?

789
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,106
Chloe, he tried to kill me.

790
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,744
He betrayed us all--
you, me,

791
00:32:44,812 --> 00:32:45,745
and Bill,

792
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:48,115
and right now
our only responsibility

793
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,249
is to stop him.

794
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:51,452
Now, I need to know
that you can treat him

795
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,355
as an enemy combatant,
that you are with me on this.

796
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:57,491
Okay, I'll do
whatever you say.

797
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:02,463
<i>No, I need to know
that you are with me on this.</i>

798
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,502
I'm with you.

799
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,936
Okay.

800
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:12,006
Let's go.

801
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:26,220
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.

802
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:28,055
27 years old.

803
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:30,991
He's a day laborer at
Cabrera Granite Construction.

804
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:32,192
Immigration status?

805
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,193
Illegal.

806
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,595
His visa expired
as of January.

807
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:37,197
Ties to any
extremist groups?

808
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,067
No, none, but there's
definitely anger there.

809
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:41,235
Both parents were killed

810
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:42,403
in a U.S. air strike
by the Pakistani border.

811
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,971
He was 11 at the time.

812
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,474
Fits the psych profile.

813
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:50,644
Bit of a loner,
a mystery to his coworkers,

814
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:52,079
and we build the rest.

815
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:53,880
What about the family?

816
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,651
One younger brother, who he's
pretty much raised on his own.

817
00:33:57,718 --> 00:33:58,718
It's perfect, huh?

818
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:01,555
NEWSCASTER:
Though it is doubtful

819
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,390
that anyone sleeps very well
in D.C. tonight,

820
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,194
a certain calm has now settled
over the streets of Capitol Hill

821
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,629
after an unprecedented series
of terror attacks

822
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:13,534
left people all over the country
shaken and demanding answers.

823
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:15,835
In her speech, President Taylor
went a long way...

824
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:16,836
Hey.

825
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:17,837
Morning.

826
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,839
Pour yourself
some orange juice.

827
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:22,276
(turns television off)

828
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,078
I'm not really very hungry.

829
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,680
Sit down, eat
some breakfast for once.

830
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:28,182
It's unhealthy not to.

831
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:29,516
What are you doing up anyway?

832
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,517
I, uh,

833
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:32,719
couldn't sleep.

834
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,591
Listen, uh, I want you to come
home straight after work today.

835
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,426
Okay?

836
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,395
No dillydallying.

837
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:42,396
Why?

838
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:44,598
Just in case.

839
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,266
In case of what?

840
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,136
These attacks,
this terrorism--

841
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,304
it's all over the news.

842
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,773
Okay, it's not a good day
to be a Muslim.

843
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,876
Jibraan, Muslims had
nothing to do with it.

844
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:58,745
Doesn't matter.

845
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:01,181
Nobody cares, believe me.

846
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:04,251
Most of the guys at my work
think I'm Puerto Rican anyway.

847
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,987
(chuckles)

848
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:11,024
It's about time.

849
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:40,554
Come in.

850
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,189
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

851
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:43,490
What is it?

852
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,160
The attorney general asked me
to check in with you.

853
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,195
He is waiting
to sign off on a document

854
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:50,831
I was told you were reviewing.

855
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,233
Anyone happen to mention to you

856
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,901
what this
document is about?

857
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:54,902
No, ma'am.

858
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,804
No, I imagine
they wouldn't.

859
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:58,939
It's a secret,

860
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:01,909
highly classified.

861
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:04,044
Not that I give a damn.

862
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:06,113
(quavering):
It's a get-out-
of-jail-free card

863
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,448
for Jonas Hodges,

864
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:12,486
the bastard responsible
for my brother's death

865
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:14,221
and so many others.

866
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:16,656
I don't understand, ma'am.

867
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:19,526
Mr. Hodges died
in the hospital.

868
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,130
I wish that were the case,
but no,

869
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:25,699
and once the A.G. signs this
witness protection agreement,

870
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,934
Hodges is going

871
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:31,238
to live out his days in
comfort and anonymity

872
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:35,175
while my brother lies in
his grave in Arlington Cemetery.

873
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:39,914
Does that sound like justice
to you, Aaron?

874
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:43,250
No, ma'am, it does not.

875
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,085
And yet my mother saw fit

876
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:47,788
to reward this monster
for his cooperation.

877
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:50,557
Well, I'm sure it was
a difficult decision

878
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,992
for the president
to make.

879
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,294
Not difficult
enough.

880
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,995
My mother may be
able to live with it,

881
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:58,198
but I'm not
sure I can.

882
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:03,170
Ms. Taylor, I have seen
the guilty walk free

883
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:05,039
many times.

884
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,074
I understand your anger
and frustration,

885
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,010
and I am genuinely sorry.

886
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:15,649
Um...

887
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:19,286
tell the A.G. I've
reviewed the agreement

888
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,255
and we can
move ahead.

889
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,824
Thank you, ma'am.

890
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,862
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

891
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,832
Other than kill
Jonas Hodges, no.

892
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:40,307
I'm sorry, Aaron.

893
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,575
I didn't mean that.

894
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,344
I was just venting.

895
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,746
Ma'am.

896
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:16,176
(phone rings)

897
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:18,578
(man grunts)

898
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,548
Hello?

899
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:22,549
OLIVIA:
Martin?

900
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:23,783
It's Olivia Taylor.

901
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:24,784
Did I wake you?

902
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:27,221
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

903
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:28,222
What time is it?

904
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,656
Almost 4:00.

905
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,458
Actually I didn't expect
to catch you at home.

906
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:32,559
I thought you were
in Florida

907
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:34,794
doing opposition
for the Gainor campaign.

908
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:37,664
No, that didn't
really work out.

909
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,066
Why not?

910
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:41,768
Let's just say that my methods
were a little hardball

911
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:43,970
for the governor's taste.

912
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,672
(sighs)

913
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:50,010
So... what can I do
for you, Olivia?

914
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,479
You heard about the attack
on the White House?

915
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:55,382
Yeah, I watched your mother's
address to the nation.

916
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,683
Really impressive.

917
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,319
She continues to
surprise, doesn't she?

918
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:00,887
Listen, Martin,
I need your help.

919
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,122
Can we meet?

920
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,857
Now?
Yeah.

921
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,326
Well, what's this about,
Olivia?

922
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,128
I can't talk about
it over the phone.

923
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:09,996
Well, it's the middle
of the night, you know?

924
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:12,066
Y-You got to do
better than that.

925
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:17,871
We were in a dive hotel bar
in Atlanta

926
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,005
right after we picked Hayworth

927
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:20,941
to be the running mate
on the ticket.

928
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,842
There was an issue
regarding his abuse

929
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,079
of a certain prescription drug

930
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:27,214
and a local reporter who
couldn't be persuaded

931
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,582
to shut up about it.

932
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:32,986
I remember
you turned to me and said

933
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:34,020
there was no problem

934
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:37,191
that couldn't be handled
or eliminated.

935
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,793
Uh-huh.

936
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,729
Well, I was drunk.

937
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,431
You were serious.

938
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:47,000
You know, you're right.

939
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,035
We shouldn't be talking
about this over the phone.

940
00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:51,238
How soon can you be
at the White House?

941
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,039
How's 15 minutes sound?

942
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:55,109
Good.

943
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:02,216
CHLOE:
You done with that yet?

944
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:03,783
I'm not familiar
with these commands.

945
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:07,154
Oh, you don't want to boot
the subnet with server two.

946
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:08,888
It has a faulty bus that
we weren't able to fix

947
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:10,023
before you guys
impounded it.

948
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:11,825
Well, maybe you'd
like to take over.

949
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:14,794
Only if you want it
to work right.

950
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:17,797
I don't like this either.

951
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:19,333
Is there a problem?
Yes, there is.

952
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,001
I'm not comfortable
doing this.

953
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:23,003
I agreed to it,
but I don't like it.

954
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,971
What exactly aren't
you comfortable with?

955
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,807
Uh, well, the Bill of Rights
being violated, for one,

956
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,042
so if you're going
to be doing anything

957
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,043
grossly illegal,
please...

958
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,077
We'll make sure
we notify you

959
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:32,846
so you can leave the building.

960
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,862
Hello, Big Brother.

961
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:50,830
Look, if you think your need

962
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:53,300
to complain is more important
than the lives of the people

963
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,669
that are counting on us,
go whine somewhere else!

964
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:57,638
Jack, it's okay.
No, it is not okay!

965
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,707
President David Palmer
recommissioned these servers

966
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:02,976
because he felt it was
vital to national security!

967
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,045
President Palmer
made the call!

968
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:06,913
Is that going to be
good enough for you?!

969
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,382
Answer me!

970
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:09,449
Yes.

971
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,942
There's something
really wrong with him.

972
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,578
He said
President Palmer.

973
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:39,279
He meant Taylor.

974
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:41,415
He said it twice.

975
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,944
What is this now?

976
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:11,978
Probably a fuse.

977
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:14,381
Here, you do
what you can

978
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,950
to finish up.

979
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:19,553
I'm gonna go
check the box.

980
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:35,101
(grunts)

981
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:36,136
Jibraan!

982
00:42:36,203 --> 00:42:37,604
Hamid?

983
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:40,206
Jibra...

984
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,843
Hamid?

985
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:46,546
(grunts)

986
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,683
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

987
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:51,618
Who are you?
What do you want?
Shut up!

988
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:53,754
What did you do
to my brother?

989
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,988
Hamid!
One more word,

990
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:56,956
I put a bullet in your brain.

991
00:42:57,024 --> 00:42:57,957
Understand?

992
00:42:58,025 --> 00:42:59,859
You understand?!
Yes!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
