*********

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,250
We're done debating this, joe.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,840
The un's been issuing
reprimands and economic sanctions

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,840
while benjamin juma has slaughtered
over 200,000 of his own people.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,130
That number will continue to
grow if we don't stop him now.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,260
Did you find something?

10
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:34,190
I did. It doesn't confirm how your
son died, but it is suspicious.

11
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:36,015
I'm listening.

12
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:41,387
His girlfriend, samantha, received a large lump
sum deposit about three days after roger's suicide.

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,423
You mean his alleged suicide.

14
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,290
I'll talk to her myself.

15
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:48,762
Sorry for interrupting, senator.
We have a subpoena for jack bauer.

16
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:51,362
He's being questioned by
the united states senate.

17
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,403
We need mr. Bauer immediately.

18
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:57,513
The cip firewall protects every major
infrastructure system in this country.

19
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:00,040
If it were breached they
would all be vulnerable.

20
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:02,842
The department of justice is about
to file criminal charges against me.

21
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,963
I'm not exactly in a
position to help you.

22
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:08,373
One of the men behind this
threat is someone you know.

23
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:11,012
You think tony's looking for
justice by attacking this country?

24
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:14,080
Help me find almeida, and
you can ask him yourself.

25
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:15,893
Where's tony almeida?

26
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,511
I'm not talking to you.

27
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,410
- This is your call.
- Do whatever it takes.

28
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:26,100
All right! All right! All
right! I'll tell you what I know!

29
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,921
Last time I saw almeida...

30
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:37,032
there's nothing you or
the fbi can do about this.

31
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,862
Just stay away.

32
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:41,622
Tony, just talk to me. tony!

33
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:44,300
Gsa 117, this is northeast three.

34
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:46,373
Go ahead, air traffic control.

35
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:48,140
Advise passing 7,000.

36
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,652
Should be a smoother
ride for you down there.

37
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,132
Roger that, northeast three.

38
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,581
Gsa 117, enter descent for 1,500.

39
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:58,041
I've lost comm with gsa 117.

40
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,242
Call back fbi.

41
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:03,130
Tell them we have a 767 on approach
no longer under our control.

42
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:08,913
***********

43
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,631
Anybody get through to
global skies 117 yet?

44
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:18,853
Not yet, sir. We're trying everything.

45
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:19,981
Where's the plane?

46
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:23,530
120 miles miles southwest
of jfk. Right here.

47
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,861
All right, we have
to alert them somehow.

48
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,231
Analyze the projected flight path.

49
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,580
Figure out if there's any way we can
contact them visually from the ground.

50
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,861
Todd, access the passenger records.

51
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,183
Get as many cell numbers as
you can and try calling them.

52
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,111
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,940
Nothing on the emergency channels?

54
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:40,813
They're not trying to contact anyone,
but they just descended to 1,500.

55
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,460
I don't know on whose directions.

56
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,122
- Sir, I think I've got it.
- Got what?

57
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:47,252
Listen to this. This was recorded
right after we lost comm with them.

58
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,903
Gsa 117, this is northeast three.

59
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,471
Go ahead, air traffic control.

60
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:54,680
Advise passing 7,000. Maintain 1,500.

61
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,003
Traffic ahead reporting
minor turbulence.

62
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:59,960
Should be a smoother
ride for you down there.

63
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:03,491
They think they're
communicating with us.

64
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,102
Bureau.

65
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:08,683
This is air traffic
control, northeast three.

66
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:10,501
I need to talk to
agent moss. It's urgent.

67
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:13,020
I'll put you through.

68
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:16,251
Agent moss, I'm transferring
air traffic control again.

69
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:18,123
What's your status, sid?

70
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:22,230
Larry, the people that broke through the
firewall are controlling one of my planes.

71
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:25,592
They're talking directly to the pilot
as if they're air traffic control.

72
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,393
As long as the pilot thinks he's talking to
one of us, he'll do whatever they tell him.

73
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,362
My god...

74
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:34,722
Gsa 117, this is
northeast three control.

75
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,111
go ahead, air traffic control.

76
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:38,013
Standby for new runway assignment.

77
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:40,690
Turn right, heading
zero-six-zero.

78
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:44,601
Intercept radar vectors
for runway three-one-left.

79
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:48,682
Northeast three, we're showing
jfk weather systems unchanged.

80
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:53,732
Yeah, we've had a change in wind direction.
Locally, there's danger of wind shear.

81
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:55,011
Roger that, northeast three.

82
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,893
We're turning to heading
zero-six-zero now.

83
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:02,030
All right, they're changing course.

84
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:08,473
I just got off the phone with sid paulson
at northeast three air traffic control.

85
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,312
Almeida's group is
definitely in their system.

86
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,350
Larry... nsa just detected it.

87
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:15,181
They're trying to locate the point
of entry, but they're not optimistic.

88
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:17,770
Forget where they got into the system.
How the hell do we get them out?

89
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:21,240
They don't know. They've never
seen anything like this before.

90
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:25,002
I got the alley.

91
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,813
Larry, go to channel two.

92
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:29,960
Yeah, go ahead.

93
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,761
I hope you got information from
schector. This thing has escalated.

94
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:33,861
"Escalated" how?

95
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:37,020
Almeida's group has picked out a 767
in flight. They're controlling it.

96
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,151
What? Why, to what end?

97
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:40,592
I don't know, but we've
got to find this guy.

98
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:41,813
What did schector say?

99
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,543
- Not much before he was killed.
- What?

100
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:47,773
Sniper across the street. We sealed off the
building immediately; we know he's in there.

101
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:55,071
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it was surgical.

102
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,993
I'm sending you swat teams
to search the building.

103
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:58,952
Thank you. Swat teams are on their way.

104
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:00,550
I think you got a problem.

105
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:02,840
Almeida called that office
seconds after schector was killed.

106
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,231
How do you think he knew I was there?

107
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:05,531
I'm assuming he had him under watch.

108
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:08,522
- I think it came from your office.
- What?

109
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,741
Someone from inside the
fbi had to tip him off.

110
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,830
They were the only people
who knew I was going with you.

111
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:13,932
No, I can't believe that.

112
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:15,920
Yeah, and I didn't want to believe
tony almeida was a terrorist,

113
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:19,031
but at some point we have to deal with the
facts, not what we want to believe is true.

114
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:20,193
Look, jack, I read your file.

115
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:22,060
I know you have a propensity
for not trusting people,

116
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:24,321
but my team has been working
around the clock to find almeida;

117
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:25,373
they are all good agents.

118
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,581
Explain to me how they got a
sniper on the roof that quickly.

119
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,803
I told you, almeida
had schector staked out.

120
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:31,620
We were in schector's
office for ten minutes.

121
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,550
There is no way they got a
shooter in position that fast.

122
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,512
Now, until you know where the leak is, you
have to assume that you've got a bad agent,

123
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:40,391
and you need to work around him.

124
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,992
No offense, jack, but I brought you here to help
with schector, not to co-manage this operation.

125
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:46,773
You brought me here to
help you find almeida.

126
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,281
And I am warning you, you
better be careful who you let in.

127
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,121
Mr.Bauer, I need you
to surrender the gun.

128
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:04,562
Agent kilner... jack bauer, put
him in your vehicle till I get back.

129
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:07,102
Yes, ma'am. This way, sir.

130
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:18,141
What's your status?

131
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,033
We secured the building;
all exits are covered.

132
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:24,081
When swat team gets here, we'll have video
feed and we'll sweep the building room by room.

133
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:27,221
- If the shooter's in there, we'll find him.
- He's in there.

134
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:47,261
Janis, whatever you've got on faa,
leave it with to sean. Come here.

135
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:50,333
- Wait a minute. I need her here.
- So do I.

136
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:55,462
There was sniper fire at schector's
office. We've got three dead bodies.

137
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:56,401
- Where renee was?
- Yeah.

138
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,113
- Is she okay?
- She's fine. Listen, I need you to provide support.

139
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,182
Renee thinks s has the sniper
locked in the columbia building.

140
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:03,561
- There are swat teams on the way; coordinate with them.
- Okay.

141
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:05,831
Anything else from nsa on how
we get through to that plane?

142
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,152
No, but we talked to one of
the men who worked with latham,

143
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:12,290
who said that based on the way the firewall
was breeched, he doesn't think we can contact.

144
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,305
- yeah?
- Yeah, it's agent moss.

145
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,857
Hey, got any help for us?

146
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,903
Nsa's nowhere. What about you?

147
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,462
We're trying to contact passengers.

148
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,701
So far we haven't been
able to get through tanyone.

149
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:28,711
What about air force?

150
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,701
They've scrambled an f-16 to intercept,
but it's still about 13 minutes out.

151
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:35,072
- Look, let me get back to you.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,153
Gus, have you been able to
break into their channel yet?

153
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:39,222
No, but I can hear almeida
talking with the pilot.

154
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:41,911
He's landing him on
runway three-one-left.

155
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:44,552
It can't be that simple.

156
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:49,610
These people didn't take control of this plane
just so they can land it on a different runway.

157
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,941
Todd, what do you got on
your radar that's on approach?

158
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,100
Everything looks good.

159
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:56,820
And gsa 117?

160
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:58,950
Nothing near it.

161
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,572
what the hell is this?

162
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:02,793
What happened?

163
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:05,282
All the scres for the
eastern quadrant are locked.

164
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,330
Try the backup systems.

165
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:09,113
they're not working.

166
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:12,003
- Todd! It's locked!
- Mine, too.

167
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,862
Okay, they're blind.

168
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:21,401
All right... send their sunrise flight into
an intersecting landing pattern with 117.

169
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,280
Sri35, this is northeast three control.

170
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:30,070
We have a new runway assignment for you.

171
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,801
Set your vectors for
final: Runway four-right.

172
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:36,320
Roger that, northeast three.

173
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,983
He's changing course.

174
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,491
- paulson.
- How do your screens look over there?

175
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:53,320
- Who is this?
- That doesn't matter.

176
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:57,341
What matters is that I
took out your control units.

177
00:08:57,865 --> 00:08:59,553
Call the bureau. Trace this call.

178
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,761
- What the hell do you want?
- Want you to see what we can do.

179
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:07,520
Why don't you pull up the
surveillance cameras at jfk tower.

180
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:12,542
Give me the cameras at jfk.

181
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,681
Sid, there's another plane
landing on four-right.

182
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:18,701
It crosses
three-one-left.

183
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:20,993
Oh, my god, they're
on a collision course.

184
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:23,843
Scramble emergency at jfk.

185
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:49,073
Gsa 117, pull up. Safety alert, pull up.

186
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:52,260
- Traffic on runway
four-right. - Pull up.

187
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,912
sir,we have screens
and communication back.

188
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,181
Phil...

189
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,702
we're good.

190
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:18,641
yeah.

191
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,761
That was just a warning shot.

192
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:23,721
Whatever we do next will
not be a demonstration.

193
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:25,343
It'll be the real thing.

194
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,972
What do you people want?

195
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:29,620
You'll find out soon enough.

196
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,303
it's emerson.

197
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,151
Emerson's here.

198
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,592
Get the module ready.

199
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,373
Uncuff him.

200
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:41,462
What happened to those planes?

201
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,820
Don't worry about that.

202
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:45,172
Did you crash them?

203
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,283
How many people did you kill?

204
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:52,953
Get him cleaned up.

205
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,792
Hey,tony.

206
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:08,913
David.

207
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,843
I take it everything went as planned.

208
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:14,120
Yeah. The off-site testing
the module worked perfectly.

209
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:15,900
Let's see it

210
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,751
good.

211
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,802
That's our genius,huh?

212
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:33,392
Yes,it is.

213
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,772
Had to be encouraged?

214
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,171
Yeah,but...I've got him to a place
where he'll do whatever you want.

215
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:39,800
Can I talk to you a second?

216
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,532
Take the module.

217
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:48,940
So,tell me how the fbi
managed to find schector.

218
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,913
They used an old colleague of mine.

219
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,323
An agent I worked with
at ctu named jack bauer.

220
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,202
I know who bauer is.

221
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,690
Yeah,well,he's not
going to be a problem.

222
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:01,412
I took care of schector before
he could tell the fbi anything.

223
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,271
I'll take care of jack bauer,too.

224
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:05,260
I n't want you distracted
from this new job.

225
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,873
Speaking of which,you
haven't told me what that is.

226
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:08,760
Tanner has the specs.

227
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:11,141
He'll brief you when he gets here.

228
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:13,843
Why don't you just tell me now?

229
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:16,443
'Cause you don't need to know yet.

230
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:18,793
Tony,we've been doing this three years.

231
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:23,211
The less information any one
of us has,the safer we all are.

232
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:26,301
Come on,after this next job,we're done.

233
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:30,202
Cash in our chips,do whatever we want.

234
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,742
All right.

235
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,880
I'll call you when tanner gets here.

236
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:34,952
Okay.

237
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:36,472
Let's go.

238
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:39,581
Come on,let's go.

239
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:41,370
I'm about to make a statement,sir.

240
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:43,601
Are there any changes
I should know about?

241
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:44,852
No,this is fine.

242
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:50,602
Just remember,don't indicate when the go-ahead to
invade will be given,no matter how hard they push.

243
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:54,423
But it's acceptable to mention that the president
is meeting with former prime minister matobo?

244
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,193
Yes.

245
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,681
And when they ask whether the
president sees him as juma's successor?

246
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,551
No need to hide that fact.

247
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:04,200
President wants maximum exsure
on her support for matobo.

248
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:05,900
Thank you,sir.

249
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:15,520
good morning,ladies and gentlemen.

250
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:20,282
Despite obal condemnation and
un-imposed economic sanctions,

251
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:24,001
general benjamin juma has
refused to stop the genocide that

252
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:29,193
his brutal dictatorship has been
perpetrating since he took power.

253
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:35,250
President taylor has made a persuasive case to the world
that a full-scale military intervention by us forces

254
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:38,853
and a complete overthrow of the
juma regime would be the only way

255
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:43,950
to stop the continued slaughter of the
innocent men,women and children of sangala.

256
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:45,190
yes,you there.

257
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:48,921
Angela,has the president formulated
a timeframe for this intervention?

258
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:50,703
Hello.

259
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,991
Jfk?

260
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,960
How long ago did this happen?

261
00:14:56,998 --> 00:15:00,993
I can tell you that president taylor
and former prime minister ule matobo

262
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:05,953
are meeting as we speak to
formulate a post-invasion strategy.

263
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:11,010
I know how hard you fought to get the support
needed to launch this military operation.

264
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,872
And I want you to know my country
will be eternally grateful.

265
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:17,862
Our soldiersre the ones truly
deserving of your gratitude.

266
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,712
They're the people putting
their lives on the line.

267
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:22,932
Still,I know you are taking
a great political risk.

268
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:24,833
I have no reservations.

269
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,462
Stopping juma is the right thing to do.

270
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,833
But once he's been removed from power,it is
critical that he be dealt with in a court of law.

271
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:37,662
And not in a way that would
perpetuate the cycle of violence.

272
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:42,713
Juma has killed over 200,000 of our
people,including two of my own brothers.

273
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:46,623
So no one knows more about the
"cycle of violence" than I do.

274
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:49,401
But my countrymen will
want to see juma punished.

275
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:52,842
Then punish him according
to the rule of law.

276
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:56,060
That's the only way democracy
will work in sangala.

277
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,481
If no one is treated outside the law.

278
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:02,083
Not even juma.

279
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:13,200
You have my word.

280
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:24,293
And now,I'd like for us to go over some last-minute
operational points with my secretary of defense.

281
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,180
All right.

282
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:30,323
Excuse me,mr.Matobo.

283
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:34,961
What's the emergency,ethan?

284
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:39,730
Northeast air traffic control just reported a
near-miss between two commercial flights at jfk.

285
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,891
Fortunately,no one was hurt.

286
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,221
And we think this man
almeida was behind it?

287
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:45,022
It's him.

288
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,880
We verified his voice print.

289
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:50,943
He contacted air traffic control and
told them this was a demonstration;

290
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:52,441
a shot across the bow,so to speak.

291
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,451
What does he want?

292
00:16:53,475 --> 00:17:00,353
His exact words were:
"You'll find out soon enough."

293
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,732
Oh,this is unacceptable.

294
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,582
I mean,it's just technology.

295
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:06,712
We should be able to
unplug these bastards.

296
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,393
Well,we're trying everything we can
think of,but it's not that simple.

297
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,090
What's being done to find almeida?

298
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:14,142
The fbi believes they're closing
in on one of his associates.

299
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,001
What's their timeframe?

300
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:17,301
That's unclear.

301
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:22,822
Let's go ahead with grounding all nonessential air
traffic,and set up a meeting with homeland,fbi,and dod.

302
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:24,720
Yes,madam president.

303
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,723
Yeah.

304
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,442
Who is it?

305
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,182
Hold on.

306
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:34,012
Tanner.

307
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,240
Hey,tanner,what's going on?

308
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:42,933
I'm trapped in the columbia building.

309
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,701
Fbi's sweeping it right
now,floor by floor.

310
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:47,392
I don't know how the hell
I'll be able to get past them.

311
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,743
I understand. Exactly where
in the building are you?

312
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:50,941
The basement.

313
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:54,071
Near the west stairwell.

314
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:57,590
We're on 12th.

315
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,031
Roger that,alpha.

316
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,280
M Sixth floor's clear. We're moving.

317
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:04,260
Charlie two,moving to the fifth floor.

318
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:05,871
Proceed.

319
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,740
Mr.Bauer?

320
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,983
Yeah?

321
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:15,490
I just wanted
to tell you--

322
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:20,112
what they're making you go through
at that senate hearing,it's wrong.

323
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:24,190
No,it's not.

324
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:28,770
It's better that everything
comes out in the open.

325
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:37,443
We've done so many secret things over the years in the
name of protecting this country we've created two worlds:

326
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:40,602
Ours and the people
we promised to protect.

327
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,433
They deserve to know the truth.

328
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:46,093
Then they can decide how
far they want to let us go.

329
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,893
Still,you don't deserve
to be treated that way,

330
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:54,290
not after what you've
done for our country.

331
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:57,660
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.

332
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,751
Thank you.

333
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:17,953
Entering the basement
from the west stairwell.

334
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,622
Roger that,agent lennert.

335
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:55,652
I'm here to get you out.

336
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,823
Tony sent me.

337
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:00,982
How?

338
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,161
Put this on.

339
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,032
A swat unit just cleared the stairwell.

340
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:09,283
Take it up to the lobby.

341
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:15,263
There's a gray ford parked next to the
kiosk in the lot behind the building.

342
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:17,213
Go.

343
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,382
This is lennert.

344
00:20:23,716 --> 00:20:25,370
Basement level is clear.

345
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:26,251
Roger that.

346
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:28,730
Alpha team is clearing the first
floor.You can hook up with them.

347
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,393
On my way.

348
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:32,872
Agent walker,she's good,huh?

349
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,412
Yes,sir.

350
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,812
She understands what it
takes to get the job done.

351
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:42,161
You mind if I step out and get some air?

352
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:44,213
It's been a hell of a morning.

353
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:45,800
Yeah,sure thing.

354
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:47,520
Just stay close,sir.

355
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:49,242
Yeah.Thanks.

356
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,083
Just got an update from headquarters.

357
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,543
Your friend,tony almeida,just used the device
to orchestrate a neariss between two planes.

358
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:09,021
He's threatening to
do it for real ne time.

359
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,633
Are all your men represented
on the deployment grid?

360
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,270
Yeah.Why?

361
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,170
I don't want you to do anything
now,but see that man walking away?

362
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,173
That's your shooter.

363
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,643
How can that be possible?

364
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,602
If one of your people helped him get
through the perimeter.Check the grid.

365
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:30,943
Look out.

366
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:36,273
You're right.He's not one of ours.

367
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:38,271
We'll follow him,see if he leads
us back to almeida-- dornan.

368
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,551
No,that's not the right move.

369
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:45,910
You can't bring anyone else into this,not until
you know how badly the bureau's been compromised.

370
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,583
Okay,so what are you suggesting?

371
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:49,401
We can do this on our own.

372
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,631
Yes,agent walker?

373
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:54,040
Ma'am?

374
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:56,880
Put more agents on the eastern edge of
the building.The perimeter looks light.

375
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:58,382
On it.

376
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:00,322
- You made the right call.
- We'll see.

377
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:04,101
I need your vehicle.

378
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:27,750
We have some breaking news
to tell you about right now.

379
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:34,630
The faa nfirms a near-miss between two planes at
jfk international airport just a short time ago.

380
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:38,282
As a result,outgoing flights
nationwide are now grounded.

381
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,111
Planes already in the air will
be grounded once they land.

382
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:41,762
The faa...

383
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:43,362
listen to me,latham.

384
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:45,451
Do as you're told,you'll stay alive.

385
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:47,993
You understand?

386
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:49,850
Put him in storage.Watch him.

387
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:59,380
an effective demonstration,wouldn't
you say,mr.Dubaku?

388
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:02,421
Very effective.

389
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:04,840
General juma will be pleased.

390
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:08,462
Is that the module?As promised.

391
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:13,652
And I've brought the man who constructed it here
in case there are any modifications necessary.

392
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:17,462
Well,now that we've impressed upon the
white house what we can do,mr.Dubaku,

393
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:21,600
perhaps now would be a good time to make
your demands known to president taylor.

394
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:25,140
Make the preparations.

395
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,793
Your government killed my
other and they tried to kill me.

396
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:32,463
Now they are going to pay
a very steep price for...

397
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:35,211
interfering in our affairs.

398
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,990
Faa is landing flights,so
far without incident,

399
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,643
but these people have
proven what they can do,

400
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:48,002
and at any time,can sabotage air traffic or any of
the infrastructure systems we have beyond the firewall.

401
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:51,921
Does nsa have a timeframe on fixing it
so we can keep these pele out permanently?

402
00:23:52,027 --> 00:23:55,920
Madame president,the cip firewall was
the result of a multi-year project.

403
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:58,222
Reengineering the code
could take weeks or months.

404
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:00,493
At this point,nsa just doesn't know.

405
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:03,713
Exactly what systems are
vulnerable,dr.Cornell?

406
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:07,140
At the top of the list would
be the national power grid.

407
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:11,151
If disabled,we could end up being unable
to deliver power to many millions of people.

408
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:15,060
A blackout of that scale would almost
certainly result in rioting in the major cities.

409
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:18,900
Even more critical are the water
treatment and distribution systems.

410
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:21,721
By sabotaging key dams and
sewage processing plants,

411
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:24,451
they could contaminate drinking
water on a massive scale.

412
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:27,511
Deaths from poisoning would
be substantial up front

413
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:32,143
and massive casualties would follow soon
thereafter as people began to die from dehydration.

414
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,322
Is there any way to
protect these systems?

415
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,472
The only way would be shutting them
down,and then,within a short time,

416
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:41,853
it would be impossible to supply the
population with sufficient food and clean water.

417
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:45,960
The resulting civil unrest would
undoubtedly aggravate the situation.

418
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:49,153
Here are the latest projections.

419
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,000
Thank you.

420
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,760
Ethan kanin.

421
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:06,582
Mr.Kanin,this is agent gedge.

422
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:08,100
I'm with the first gentleman.

423
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,110
With him where?What's he doing?

424
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:13,530
Mr.Taylor is on his way to
confront roger's former girlfriend.

425
00:25:13,656 --> 00:25:15,331
I thought he gave up on all of this.

426
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:18,941
Sir,he's consumed by the idea that his son
was murdered,and for the past two months,

427
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:23,830
he's been pursuing that belief through a private
detective he hired without the president's knowledge.

428
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:26,090
My god.

429
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:29,321
Why is this the first time I'm
hearing anything about this?

430
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,191
I take full responsibility for that,sir.

431
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:34,311
Mr.Taylor enlisted me in keeping his
activities off the official manifest,

432
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:37,521
but,uh,it's gotten out of hand.

433
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:40,970
And at this point,I'm
worried about mr.Taylor'S...

434
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:42,623
state of mind.

435
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:44,390
I think the president needs
to know what's going on.

436
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,072
All right.

437
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,331
Thank you,agent gedge.

438
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:54,213
Agent gedge?

439
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,653
- Sir?
- Everything all right?

440
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:57,601
Yes,sir.Just checking in.

441
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:03,271
Building disaster preparedness
scenarios is not enough.

442
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:07,271
I want the governors to put the national
guard on a pre-deployment footing.

443
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:09,403
And until we find and stop
the people behind this,

444
00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:12,273
I think we should talk about
raising the alert level.

445
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,560
Yes,sir,we have the building locked down,and
we're searching for the suspect as we speak.

446
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:18,551
It's our higst priority,sir.

447
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:20,201
Understood,sir.

448
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:22,950
The white house is all over
this.Homeland's leaning on us.

449
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,792
We have got to find this guy now.

450
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:27,233
Dornan's team is almost done with
their first sweep through the building,

451
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:30,001
but he said it's his gut feeling
that the sniper is not in there.

452
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,653
I don't care about his gut feeling.

453
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:34,612
Renee said they had that building locked
down right after the shots were fired.

454
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,352
- He's got to be in there.
- Yes,sir.

455
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:37,872
Tell them to search every square inch.

456
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:40,281
what?

457
00:26:41,188 --> 00:26:44,520
Dornan also wants to know if
we know where agent walker is.

458
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,763
She's not at the scene?

459
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:48,913
She left ten minutes ago
without logging her destination.

460
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:52,532
What about bauer?

461
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:54,561
He left the scene with her.

462
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:17,783
He's coming up on heavy traffic.You
can drop back a little more.

463
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:20,003
It's all right.I've got him.

464
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,111
- it's larry.
- Don't answer it.

465
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:28,171
Then he'll get worried or suspicious.

466
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,573
Dornan said you left the scene.

467
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:36,173
Why?What's going on?

468
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:39,233
Swat has the operation well in
hand.I'm following up on a lead.

469
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,621
What lead?

470
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:42,810
A weapon we found at schector'S.There's
a partial serial number.

471
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:44,523
I want to run it past a source.

472
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:48,061
- With bauer?
- Uh,yes,he's accompanying me.

473
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:53,013
Renee...

474
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,661
what the hell's going on?

475
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,920
What are you talking about?

476
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:01,062
Getting our hands on that shooter is our best
chance of finding almeida and finding that device.

477
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:04,783
And I don't think you'd turn your
back on that operation for a lead

478
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:06,802
you could easily have
passed off to another agent.

479
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:09,432
- I'm not sure what you're getting at.
- Neither am I.

480
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,962
Has bauer gotten you
involved with something?

481
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,581
Larry,do you trust me?

482
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:21,260
You know the answer to that.

483
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:23,042
Then please just accept
what I'm telling you.

484
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:26,593
We're following up on a lead,and I will
fill you in if and when we find something.

485
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:33,963
all right.

486
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:37,102
Damn it.

487
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:39,922
I do not like this.

488
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:42,861
- I just flat out lied to my boss.
- Did he buy it?

489
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:45,661
Are we in the clear?

490
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:47,823
Yeah,I think so.

491
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,663
Good.Thanks.

492
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:04,373
is renee's comm unit active?

493
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:05,952
Yeah.Her walkie's on.

494
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:07,403
Can you do a triangulation on it?

495
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:09,922
Well,that's not really what
the system is set up for.

496
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:12,902
But I can try.

497
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:15,123
Do more than try.I want
to know where she is.

498
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,303
- Can you not just call her?
- Janis...

499
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:19,512
- just do it.
- Okay.

500
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:40,702
Back at schector's office,when I told
you to get almeida's locatio out of him,

501
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,092
how far were you
planning to go with that?

502
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,362
You told me to do whatever it takes.

503
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:50,610
Yeah,I said that for schector's benefit,to scare
him,but you were actually planning to do it.

504
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:53,301
How far would you have gone?

505
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:55,112
It doesn't matter now.

506
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,941
It does to me.

507
00:29:57,025 --> 00:30:00,131
I just put my career on the line because of
you,and I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.

508
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,490
Yeah,well,you read my file.

509
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:06,471
Your file doesn't tell me how you
justify the thingshat you've done.

510
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:11,041
You know,I've been answering a lot of questions
lately about my past and,frankly,I'm done.

511
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:13,222
I told you I'd help
you find tony almeida.

512
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:15,390
I even agreed to do it your way.

513
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:18,552
Since the fbi's been
compromised,that's no longer an option.

514
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:23,280
Now,I can still help you find him,but you're going to have to let me do it my way.

515
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,070
Is that going to be a problem?

516
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:28,790
We'll see.

517
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:54,091
I know you think this is a mistake.

518
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:55,500
It's not my place to say that,sir.

519
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:56,443
And if it was?

520
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:59,133
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend,sir.

521
00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:00,501
Not about this.

522
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:04,402
They assumed my son killed himself and didn't look deeply enough into anything.

523
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,051
This way,sir.

524
00:31:07,547 --> 00:31:11,440
Well,even though the market's been soft,you don't want to hedge your buy on this.

525
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:13,100
It's really all I can do today.

526
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:16,240
You know 10,000 shares isn't going to cut it.

527
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:17,422
excuse me a moment.

528
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:18,312
Samantha roth.

529
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:21,412
Miss roth,there is a secret service agent here to see you.

530
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:22,540
What?

531
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,442
He's at reception.

532
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:27,272
Would you like me to have someone show him to your desk?

533
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:32,160
No.

534
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,170
Um,I'll be right there.

535
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:34,492
All right.

536
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:36,421
let me call you back.

537
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,923
Ma'am.

538
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:00,840
Mr.Taylor?

539
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,970
This is quite a surprise.

540
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:04,391
How are you?

541
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:07,120
I wanted to have a word with you,sam,in private.

542
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,102
Of course.

543
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:14,772
I'm-I'm really sorry we haven't spoken since roger's funeral.

544
00:32:14,777 --> 00:32:17,923
It's just...it's been so difficult for me.

545
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:20,602
I know about the money,sam.

546
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,471
Excuse me?

547
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:27,463
$400,000 wired to an offshore account in the cayman islands three days after you found my son's body.

548
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,273
There's no point in denying it.

549
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:31,731
I just want to know who paid you and why.

550
00:32:31,737 --> 00:32:33,953
-Paid me?
-You know something about my son's death,

551
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,012
and somebody's paid you to keep quiet about it.

552
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:38,052
Mr.Taylor,that is just not true.

553
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,900
Please,just answer the question!

554
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:50,833
The money...

555
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,401
it...

556
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:55,230
-it isn't mine.
-What do you mean,it's not yours?

557
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:57,382
It belongs to my aunt.

558
00:32:57,387 --> 00:33:01,453
She's had financial difficulties since my uncle passed away last year.

559
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:03,493
It's from his divested real estate holdings.

560
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:08,011
I suggested she move it to an offshore account to hide it from the irs.

561
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:13,351
You want me to believe you had the presence of mind to commit tax fraud three days after my son died,

562
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:16,341
the man you supposedly loved?

563
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:19,090
I did love him.

564
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:21,790
And I'm telling you the truth.

565
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,243
You have to believe me.

566
00:33:23,246 --> 00:33:26,072
I don'T.

567
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:28,500
You're lying.

568
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,602
Well,if that's what you think then we have nothing left to talk about...

569
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:32,390
you're not going anywhere till I get the truth.

570
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:33,561
Let go of me.

571
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:34,593
Sir!

572
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,450
You know who murdered my son.

573
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:39,153
No one murdered him.

574
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:41,741
He killed himself.

575
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:43,282
Mr.Taylor,we need to go.

576
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:44,332
Right now.

577
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:46,063
I'm going to find out what you're hiding,

578
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,770
and when I do,god help you.

579
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:00,771
tanner.

580
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:01,582
I'm out.

581
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:02,440
Copy that.

582
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:03,983
Emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau.

583
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:04,773
He says you're clear.

584
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:05,911
Good.

585
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:08,902
Look,I need to prep my men on the next job so why don't you tell me what we need.

586
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:11,290
I'll give you the specs when I get there.

587
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:12,370
Where are you?

588
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,332
I'm just pulling in right now.

589
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,200
We'll be standing by.

590
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:23,542
When tanner gets here,we'll take off.

591
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:27,291
Why don't you start the deletion program while we pack up?

592
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:46,351
Damn it.We can't go any farther.He'll make us.Hold on.

593
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:08,170
agent walker,we need to go!

594
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:11,872
Here.You're going to need this.

595
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:14,211
Thank you.

596
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:19,773
I'll engage him.Cover my flank.

597
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,642
I can handle it.

598
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,283
Okay,let's go.Now.

599
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:01,952
put the weapon down.

600
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:03,763
Now!

601
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,481
is tony almeida on the boat?

602
00:36:09,488 --> 00:36:11,160
Is tony almeida on the boat?

603
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,380
I don't know.

604
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:16,231
jack!It doesn't matter.

605
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:17,423
Almeida's not the priority.

606
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,241
The device is.

607
00:36:18,246 --> 00:36:20,173
We have to go in now.

608
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:00,942
surveillance camera went out.

609
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:03,042
Go check it out.

610
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:29,693
cover me.

611
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:29,943
Deletion Complete

612
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:31,761
damn it!

613
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:25,641
Tony!

614
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:27,770
Stop!

615
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,093
Damn it.

616
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,700
the device is gone.

617
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:06,331
The locator files have been deleted.

618
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,962
Where is it?

619
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:19,980
okay.

620
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,041
What happened to you?

621
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:42,930
What the hell happened to you?

622
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:46,530
