3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,222
I've thought
about what we talked about.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,058
I want to move back to LA with you.

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,309
- Really?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:21,979
- You're coming with us tonight?
- If it's okay.

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,273
Dad, I don't know what to say.
I'm so happy!

8
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,361
- How the hell did you find me?
- I have information.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,539
I'm out. I don't work
for the government anymore.

10
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,366
This you're gonna want to hear.
There's a big hit going down.

11
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,939
President Hassan at the UN,
he's getting taken out.

12
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:37,453
- When?
- Today,

13
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,163
before he can sign with Taylor.

14
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,541
My country agrees to abandon
the pursuit of nuclear weapons.

15
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:45,419
But our terms, Mr. President,

16
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,214
were that the inspectors themselves
would be American,

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,507
not IAEA.

18
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,884
This is the message you send
to the rest of the world,

19
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,220
and then you wonder
why we don't want to negotiate!

20
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,055
Please excuse my brother's passion.

21
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,557
We need to resolve this issue
before we can move forward.

22
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,103
Find a way to give him what he wants.
This man is a once-in-a-lifetime leader.

23
00:01:02,858 --> 00:01:06,524
- I'm stuck outside.
- I'll take care of it.

24
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,360
This woman poses no threat to me
or the peace process.

25
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,778
But you are married.

26
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,822
I've done nothing reckless.

27
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:14,782
Just reinstate Ms. Reed's
clearance now.

28
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,451
Unless you want to destroy
everything that he's worked for,

29
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,078
stay away from him.

30
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,540
The brother revoked my clearance,
but I had Hassan reinstate it.

31
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,375
I know I'm behind schedule,

32
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,835
but it'll get done.

33
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,586
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

34
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,964
Jack Bauer's on line three.
He needs to talk to you.

35
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,259
I'm with an informant

36
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,345
who has intel on an assassination
attempt on President Hassan.

37
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,390
And what does Mr. Aruz
want in return for his information?

38
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,058
CTU protection and immunity.

39
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,935
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.

40
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,356
Don't stop! Keep going!

41
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:58,200
Get him out of here.
He's losing a lot of blood!

42
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,202
Hastings wants to debrief you
back at CTU.

43
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,037
I'm not going back to CTU.
I'm done.

44
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,249
- I got a flight to catch.
- That's it?

45
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,084
Get down!

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,382
Tell me what you know.

47
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,010
The hitter has someone
on the inside...

48
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:17,594
close to Hassan.

49
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:36,483
It's done.

50
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:39,035
Aruz is no longer a problem.

51
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:42,516
But we don't know how much
he told CTU.

52
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,247
We need to accelerate the hit.

53
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,662
Agent Ortiz is calling in.

54
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:55,113
Put him through.
I want everyone on this.

55
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:57,871
Comm channel 235.
All right, go ahead.

56
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:01,029
This is Cole.
Where are those EMTs?

57
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:03,474
They should be there any second.
How's the rest of your team?

58
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,434
Earley's injured.
Torres and Johnson are dead.

59
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,605
What happened? Look, those drones
are supposed to have antiballistics.

60
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,557
Why didn't they take out
the missile?

61
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:14,367
- We're still running the diagnostic.
- Sir, this should've never happened!

62
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:16,612
We should've had another team
checking those buildings!

63
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:20,491
We can discuss this at a later time,
Agent Ortiz.

64
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,619
Yes, sir.
Bauer wants to talk with you.

65
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:26,497
- Put him on the phone.
- <i>Stand by.</i>

66
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:29,485
Jack, I have Mr. Hastings
on the line.

67
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,728
Victor Aruz told me
right before he died

68
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,590
that the assassin is working
with someone very close to Hassan.

69
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:40,760
- Did you get a name?
- <i>No, not before he died.</i>

70
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,014
- You believe him?
- Normally, I wouldn't trust him.

71
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,767
He was dying, sir.
He had no reason to lie.

72
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,367
All right. We're on it.

73
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:50,354
I need you and Cole back here
to debrief.

74
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,773
I already gave one
of your agents my statement.

75
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,482
I need you back here.

76
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,816
Fine. We're on our way.

77
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,962
I may have a lead on that insider.

78
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:16,463
What do you mean?

79
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,856
I just picked up an unauthorized access
in the secure databases at the UN.

80
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:23,026
- How do you know it's unauthorized?
- They bypassed the main access page

81
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:25,102
and went through a back-end server.

82
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:26,974
The only reason to do that

83
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,560
is if you're trying
to cover your tracks.

84
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,515
Let me know if you trace the source.
And put O'Brian on this, too,

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,315
if you don't think
she'll slow you down.

86
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,175
- No. She's doing much better, sir.
- I'm gonna call the chief of staff.

87
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,106
They need to know this insider
could be moving against Hassan.

88
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:42,531
You are under a great deal
of pressure at home

89
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,992
from an active opposition
to this peace agreement.

90
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,162
They believe that by dismantling
your nuclear weapons programs,

91
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,081
you're surrendering to the West.
How do you respond to those charges?

92
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,336
The only thing we are surrendering
is the cloud of antagonism and mistrust

93
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:58,214
under which we have lived
for far too long.

94
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,257
This is a victory for my people.

95
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:03,969
It marks an end to isolation
and will bring economic stability

96
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,691
to my country for the first time
in decades.

97
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,557
How do you propose economic stability
when your people are so divided?

98
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:13,186
This is Weiss.
Did you bring in Victor Aruz?

99
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,346
I'm afraid not, sir.
There was an ambush,

100
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:17,649
and Aruz was killed,
along with two of our men.

101
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:19,369
Damn it.

102
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:22,869
Before Aruz died, he shared
some very troubling information.

103
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:24,841
Now, he claimed that someone close

104
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,659
to President Hassan has been
conspiring with the assassin.

105
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,621
Now, we don't have a name yet,
but we are pursuing a lead.

106
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,831
Tell me how,
and I'd better be impressed.

107
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,499
We're tracing what might be
an unauthorized entry

108
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:37,252
into one of the UN servers.

109
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,879
- This is the person we're looking for?
- We're optimistic.

110
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,131
You better hope that optimism
translates into results.

111
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,123
Sir, until we locate the insider,

112
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,874
you might want to consider
locking down President Hassan

113
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,596
and postponing this conference.

114
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,064
That is not an option, Mr. Hastings.

115
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,686
We are close to signing
one of the most important treaties.

116
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,588
You were put in charge of CTU because
you said you could get the job done.

117
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:59,501
"Lean, mean and fast",
that's what you said.

118
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,753
President Taylor expects you
to deliver on those words.

119
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,465
I'll take this to the president.
Keep me posted.

120
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,909
President Hassan and I
still have a great deal of work to do,

121
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,038
we're gonna wrap this up,
but I would like to say

122
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,747
that the president and I
chose the United Nations

123
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,815
as the venue for these talks

124
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,456
because the problems facing
the Middle East have become

125
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:20,881
a world concern.

126
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:24,561
And President Hassan and I
are confident

127
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,343
that this agreement will lay
the foundation

128
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,722
for a lasting peace in the region.

129
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,308
And we thank you for your time.

130
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:38,271
I'll see you after the break.

131
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:40,273
I look forward to resuming it.

132
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,713
Madam President,
I just spoke with CTU.

133
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:50,033
There's been a development
regarding the threat to Hassan.

134
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,101
We need to speak in private.

135
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,541
- That is really wonderful.
- Thank you. I'll join you later.

136
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:09,344
You were terrific.

137
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,109
It's not about me,

138
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,020
it's the message that's important.

139
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:16,392
I just hope no one
could see how nervous I was.

140
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,394
You hid it well.

141
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,814
- Are you here?
- Yes, on my way up.

142
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:22,857
Do you still have time to see me?

143
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,568
I've been looking forward
to it all day.

144
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,736
When?

145
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,034
- What did you say?
- When can I see you?

146
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,591
I've got half an hour
before the next session begins.

147
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:39,248
You meet me now, and we'll go up
to my private office together.

148
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,407
I'll tell my staff
that you requested an interview.

149
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:43,504
Perfect.
I'll be right there.

150
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,962
I just ran a systems
check on the drone.

151
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:52,716
Sensors did pick up the missile,
but the drone didn't fire.

152
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:53,642
Why not?

153
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,224
I won't know until I have
a chance to take it apart.

154
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,032
I don't want to sound
like I'm covering my own ass.

155
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:03,648
But I did tell you
that the antimissile system

156
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,783
had not been tested
in an urban environment.

157
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:07,758
I know what you said, Arlo.

158
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,614
You just find out what went wrong
and you get back to me.

159
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,743
Mr. Hastings, I was right.
Someone hacked into the UN database.

160
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,871
They downloaded security protocols,
the schematics to the UN

161
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,784
and Hassan's personal itinerary.

162
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,005
I was able to trace an IP address.

163
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,910
- Did you get a name?
- Chloe's into the computer's registry.

164
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:27,537
She should have it by now.

165
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:29,600
- Almost there.
- Come on, Chloe.

166
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,094
Saying that isn't gonna make it
happen any faster.

167
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:40,935
There, the computer's owner
is listed as Meredith Michelle Reed.

168
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,146
She's a reporter working
for the <i>New York Courier</i>.

169
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,815
She's doing a profile on Hassan.

170
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:46,816
Applied for a security
clearance at the UN.

171
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,651
- Did she get it?
- My God...

172
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,571
She's there now. UN Security
logged her in 15 minutes ago.

173
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,240
- She's at the press conference.
- Put me through to UN Security.

174
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,660
You're clear. Go ahead.

175
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:09,905
Okay, go ahead.

176
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,486
This is Brian Hastings,
director of CTU.

177
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:15,178
We have a possible on-site
threat to President Hassan.

178
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,989
- Do you have an ID?
- Her name is Meredith Reed.

179
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,111
She has a press security clearance.

180
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,658
We're sending a photograph
to your PDA.

181
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,229
We just got a call
about a threat to President Hassan.

182
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:27,941
The UN gave us access
to their surveillance feed.

183
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,527
Facial recognition software is
sweeping the area now.

184
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,492
Got a match. Northeast corner,
moving toward Hassan.

185
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,705
Located the suspect.

186
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,496
She's ten yards from Hassan,

187
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:46,495
east side of the press section.

188
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Green top,

189
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,670
black skirt, black jacket!

190
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:57,375
There she is.

191
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,223
- Everybody, move back!
- What are you doing?

192
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,254
I have clearance.

193
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,899
I'm a journalist! I'm a journalist.
I have credentials.

194
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,151
We got a call from CTU about a threat
to your life. Keep moving.

195
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:24,142
You're making a mistake.

196
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,535
The suspect's name is Meredith Reed.

197
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,804
She's a journalist profiling Hassan.

198
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,931
Our operating theory is that

199
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,183
she's been using her access to gain

200
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,769
security intel, which she's been
feeding to the assassin.

201
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,426
Ms. Reed is being transported
back here right now.

202
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,977
My hope is that she'll give us
the name of the assassin

203
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,151
so that we can put
an end to this threat.

204
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:58,241
Refer to your digital
briefing packets for specifics.

205
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:01,827
Mr. Hastings, I received
a preliminary report from the team

206
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,000
- sweeping Ms. Reed's apartment.
- And?

207
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,332
They recovered the files stolen
from the UN database off her laptop.

208
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,917
Looks like we found our insider.

209
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,336
They also found a file
that couldn't be opened.

210
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,842
It's been encrypted
with intelligence grade software.

211
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,301
- Find out what's inside that file.
- It's on its way over as we speak.

212
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:21,221
Excuse me, does anyone think
this happened too fast and too easily?

213
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,094
Things do happen faster in here
than what you're used to.

214
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:25,475
You keep reminding me.

215
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:27,227
I might not be up to speed

216
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,849
on all your software.
If someone doesn't want to be found,

217
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,904
they don't leave code fragments
that could lead to an IP address

218
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,952
Unless, they were in a hurry
and improvise.

219
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:39,364
Then why would you go through troubles
and leave a huge red flag?

220
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,490
You mean?

221
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:43,201
It's like someone
wanted us to find her.

222
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,999
I think we should continue to vet this
until we're sure that the right person.

223
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,338
We are vetting this
from every angle.

224
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,420
I appreciate.
We'll keep them in mind.

225
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,922
- In other words, "Shut up".
- He didn't say that.

226
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,298
- That's what I heard.
- You made your point.

227
00:11:58,423 --> 00:11:59,623
Chloe, thanks.

228
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:02,429
Last thing.

229
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,849
Ms. Reed has spent a lot of time
on assignment in the Middle East.

230
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,018
Cross-check all of her movements

231
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,210
with those of known
terrorist groups.

232
00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:11,595
Let's get moving.

233
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:21,114
Jack Bauer should be here
any second.

234
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,575
I want you to handle his debrief.

235
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,742
- You're taking me off the floor?
- You'll be better utilized

236
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:29,180
debriefing Mr. Bauer.
Go set up.

237
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,749
Thank you, sir.

238
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:39,632
I'm walking in.

239
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:43,323
Give me the home phone numbers
for Torres and Johnson.

240
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:45,347
Nobody speaks
to their wives before me.

241
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,780
Before you make your report,
keep something in mind.

242
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:51,402
- What's that?
- You asked for more boots on the ground

243
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:53,063
but what happened happened.

244
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,856
There's nothing we can do.

245
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,566
Put your opinion on record,

246
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:59,236
it's going to flag
an internal review from division.

247
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,706
It's only going
to hurt us moving forward.

248
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,460
Mr. Bauer, Brian Hastings.

249
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,994
- Sorry about the loss of your men.
- Thank you.

250
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,834
You'll be glad to know the lead
you got from Victor Aruz panned out.

251
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,960
- You've already found the insider?
- Her name's Meredith Reed, journalist.

252
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:21,669
She was covering the peace conference
and stealing files off the UN servers.

253
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,011
We wouldn't have gotten this far
without your help. Thank you.

254
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:28,246
Chloe O'Brian's waiting to debrief you.
Shouldn't take long.

255
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:30,972
I just need to make
a phone call first.

256
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,239
Excuse me.

257
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,606
We need to be on the same page here.

258
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:39,860
- I think you can understand that.
- You're asking me to lie.

259
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,604
I'm asking you
to exercise some discretion.

260
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:44,630
There's an assassin out there.

261
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:47,883
We don't need people
second-guessing how we do things.

262
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:49,745
Maybe you'd like to debrief for me.

263
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,275
- Let's get you in here.
- Hello.

264
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,170
Sweetheart, it's me.

265
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,463
Where are you?

266
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:02,007
CTU.

267
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:05,719
CTU? It's about
what's going on at the UN?

268
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,722
Yes, but I promise I won't be long.
I need to give them a statement.

269
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,013
But I'm going to have
to meet you at the airport.

270
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,477
Dad, what's going on?

271
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,838
It's complicated.
I'll explain you later.

272
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:18,705
- We're coming there to pick you up.
- You don't need to do that.

273
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,561
I want to. It's on the way.

274
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:24,235
Okay, I'll have Chloe
get you a security pass.

275
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,074
I'll see you soon. Bye.

276
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,963
Who was that?

277
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,869
- My father.
- Everything all right?

278
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,019
I'm not sure.

279
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,543
Everyone said you were too young,
and inexperienced to head up field ops,

280
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,604
but I believed you could do the job.

281
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,496
I need you to show the same faith
in me that I showed in you.

282
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,425
Keep our little dispute
off the record.

283
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:47,279
Where's Chloe?

284
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:49,777
She's upstairs.
First room to the right.

285
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,432
Thank you.

286
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,405
Think about what I said.

287
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,576
Sorry, but we got
to do this kind of quick.

288
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,995
You heard
about the reporter they arrested?

289
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,840
I think we might have the wrong person.
Meredith Reed could be innocent.

290
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,656
Hastings said they found evidence.

291
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:22,057
I know, but I think those files
may have been planted.

292
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:24,788
I've been scanning
through the traffic cam footage

293
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:27,004
from outside
Meredith Reed's apartment building.

294
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,752
Five minutes before the intrusion
into the UN server,

295
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:31,888
this man was going
into the service entrance.

296
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,890
Ten minutes later, he left.

297
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:37,646
What if he used her laptop
to break into the servers?

298
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:39,688
Sounds a little thin.

299
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,191
Don't you think we found her fast,
and that it was a little too easy?

300
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,986
Why are you showing me this
instead to Hastings?

301
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,197
He won't listen to me.
He might listen to you.

302
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,615
I'm here for my debrief.

303
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:54,786
Kim's on her way. I'm leaving
to Los Angeles with my family.

304
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:58,832
I'm just asking you to talk to him.
It'll take ten minutes.

305
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,500
If the assassin framed Reed

306
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,584
to create a diversion, that means
we have the wrong person in custody.

307
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,089
He still has someone
inside Hassan's delegation.

308
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:11,141
I'm sorry, Chloe, it's not my problem.
Let's just continue with the debrief.

309
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:18,476
<i>Nor will they confirm
any fatalities.</i>

310
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,990
<i>There is no evidence at this time
to support the theory</i>

311
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:22,974
<i>that the two incidents are related.</i>

312
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,057
<i>We're waiting for an official statement
as to why this reporter was arrested.</i>

313
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:30,077
<i>At this time we can confirm
that her name is Meredith Reed...</i>

314
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:31,929
I'm so glad you're all right.

315
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,867
I can't believe this happened.

316
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:37,704
It's hard to believe.

317
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,915
I just don't understand
how this woman got so close to you.

318
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,833
She's a journalist.

319
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:46,543
- She had security clearance.
- Do all reporters get these clearances?

320
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:49,176
But she's writing an article on me.

321
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:50,467
You know that.

322
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,720
- She was given special access.
- You gave her that access?

323
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,837
Yes, I did.

324
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:56,589
I did it.

325
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,861
This article was important for me.

326
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,895
I wanted to get my message
across to the American public.

327
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,355
- That's the only reason?
- Yes!

328
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:07,484
What other reason?
If you have something to say, say it.

329
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,981
You should never have
let her into our lives.

330
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,906
- You put us all in danger.
- Please, stop.

331
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:16,284
Excuse me.

332
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:20,705
I spoke to the UN press director.
We're going to make a public statement.

333
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:22,749
Make sure I see it first.

334
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:30,048
Omar, may I speak with you alone?

335
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,472
Excuse us.

336
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,563
They've taken Meredith Reed to CTU.

337
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,557
I can't believe she's part of this.

338
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:10,046
What reason could she have
to help someone kill me?

339
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:13,504
What reason does any American have
to do anything? Money.

340
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:16,792
They found incriminating files
on her computer, Omar.

341
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,278
Whether you want
to believe it or not, she is guilty.

342
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:20,682
And she's going to talk.

343
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:24,836
I need to know what she's going
to tell them about your relationship.

344
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:27,144
Be honest with me.

345
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,149
Tell me everything.

346
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,665
It started
three months ago in B'Dar.

347
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,776
We met for an interview,

348
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,185
in her hotel room.

349
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,127
Dalia and I
had been fighting that day.

350
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:46,702
She used you, Omar.

351
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,201
She almost cost you your life.

352
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,430
If this becomes public,
it will destroy your credibility

353
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:53,965
and that you've worked for.

354
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:56,468
I don't need you
to tell me the consequences.

355
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:58,502
If she talks to the Americans,

356
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:01,069
you must deny it.
It never happened.

357
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,644
Look, I know you're thinking
you must do the honorable thing

358
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:08,231
and confess the truth.

359
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:11,043
That would be a terrible mistake.

360
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:18,053
I need to be with my family.

361
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,894
- <i>Yes?</i>
- I just spoke with my brother.

362
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,258
I told him to deny the affair.

363
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:40,220
- What did he say?
- <i>He's going to consider it.</i>

364
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,617
Press him harder.

365
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:44,934
The reporter's claims
need to be discredited.

366
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:49,543
CTU needs to continue to think
she's my contact on the inside.

367
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,820
I understand.

368
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:53,162
We only need another hour.

369
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:55,769
I'll be ready to move by then.

370
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:07,842
Arlo.

371
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:12,019
I need you decrypting that file
they found on Reed's computer.

372
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,420
I broke off a section.
It should be on your screen.

373
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,465
- What filter to run it through?
- Esquire Nine.

374
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:18,922
No problem.

375
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:20,677
And Arlo,

376
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,637
you can stop staring at my breasts.

377
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,559
When are you going to drop
Captain America and find a real man?

378
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,814
I'm still thinking about it.

379
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,617
Well, don't take too long.

380
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,148
I might lose interest.

381
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:35,525
Let me know what you find.

382
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,174
Dana Walsh.

383
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,366
Hello?

384
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,345
Dana Walsh.

385
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,239
I like that.

386
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>You picked a good name for yourself.</i>

387
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,209
Better than the one
your mama picked for you.

388
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,296
Whoever this is,
I told you to stop calling me.

389
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,910
I know what you told me, Jenny.

390
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:01,676
My name is not Jenny.

391
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,746
You must be mistaking me
for someone else.

392
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:05,780
Am I?

393
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,474
- Yes.
- <i>That's funny.</i>

394
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,474
'Cause you sound like this girl
I used to know from Rock Springs

395
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,687
named Jenny Scott.

396
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,826
<i>She was a wild thing.
We used to do some crazy stuff.</i>

397
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:19,527
The next time you call me,

398
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:21,963
I promise you
I will contact the police.

399
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,909
I got a better idea.
Let's contact them right now.

400
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:28,828
- I'm hanging up now.
- Don't hang up this phone.

401
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:31,039
I'm warning you, Jenny, do not...

402
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,583
I was just going to look for you.

403
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,936
I'm so glad that you're okay.

404
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,018
I'm sorry,

405
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,984
that I have been so distant lately.

406
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:57,278
It's just...

407
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,401
I don't ever want to lose you.

408
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:01,759
Don't worry.

409
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,370
Why am I here?
This is a mistake.

410
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,289
- Damn it. Who's in charge here?
- Tell Mr. Weiss

411
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,323
there's nothing yet. I'll call him
as soon as we have news. Thanks.

412
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:20,296
Brian Hastings, director of CTU.

413
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,584
I don't know
who you people think you are.

414
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,258
But I want an attorney, and I demand

415
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,595
- to know what I'm being charged with.
- We found the files, Ms. Reed.

416
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,348
- What files?
- On your computer.

417
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:34,060
- You searched my apartment?
- We found six documents

418
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,813
on your laptop that were stolen
from the UN servers.

419
00:22:37,477 --> 00:22:38,940
What documents?

420
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,985
Relating to the security arrangements
for the peace conference.

421
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,405
We know that you're part
of a plan to assassinate

422
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:47,012
President Hassan.

423
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,970
What? What?

424
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:54,914
Please don't waste my time.
The evidence against you is clear-cut.

425
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,625
Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.

426
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,587
If there are files on my computer,
then someone put them there.

427
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,006
Now you listen to me.

428
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:06,223
I'm giving you a chance
by telling us what you know.

429
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,970
I need the name of the assassin,
how to find them.

430
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,681
And we talk about you avoiding
the death penalty.

431
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,280
You're wrong.

432
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:17,270
You've got the wrong person.

433
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:22,041
Take her to interrogation.
Full biometric package.

434
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:23,735
I'll be there shortly.

435
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:33,672
Mr. Hastings?

436
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:35,330
You're done with your debrief?

437
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:36,998
Yeah. Can I talk to you?

438
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:38,993
Not a good time, Mr. Bauer.

439
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,978
Meredith Reed might be
telling you the truth.

440
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,131
Is this coming from O'Brian?
I told her to drop this.

441
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:46,466
She didn't.

442
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,427
She found this.
They were taken from traffic cams

443
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,388
near Ms. Reed's apartment.
Check out the time stamps.

444
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:54,766
This man entering
through the service entrance

445
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,769
almost 5 minutes before the intrusion
into the UN servers.

446
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,896
He left the building
almost immediately.

447
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,118
- So?
- Chloe talked to the building manager.

448
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,942
No scheduled maintenance today,
no packages delivered.

449
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:08,029
This is your evidence?
I'm looking at an apartment building,

450
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,406
where dozens of people live,
coming and going by day.

451
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,202
I understand. But is that it's possible
that someone broke into the apartment

452
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,705
and steal the documents.
Send a couple agents to check it out.

453
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,499
I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

454
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,209
I can't waste valuable resources

455
00:24:21,604 --> 00:24:24,035
because Chloe O'Brian has a theory.

456
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:27,382
Chloe and I have worked together
for a long time.

457
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,218
And trust me. She's someone
you might want to listen to.

458
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,371
She's very good at what she does.

459
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,157
And if she's right, the assassin's
got you looking in the wrong place,

460
00:24:36,282 --> 00:24:37,642
and you will get bit.

461
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,960
Mr. Bauer, I have a suspect in hand

462
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:44,429
with a file
she felt damning enough to encrypt.

463
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,860
That's where I focus my resources.
Now, if you will excuse me.

464
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:54,915
I hate this place.

465
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,668
He's not going to help, is he?

466
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,797
We have to follow this lead.
If they have the wrong person...

467
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,057
I did what you asked.
I talked to Hastings.

468
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:11,776
If he doesn't want to listen,
it's his mistake. It's not my problem.

469
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,632
To be honest,
it's not yours, either.

470
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:16,556
What about the threat against Hassan?
What about the peace conference?

471
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,392
- Doesn't any of that matter to you?
- If he knows something you don't?

472
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:24,355
I'm sorry.

473
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:29,143
Kim's waiting for me outside.

474
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:31,376
I've got to go.

475
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,611
You've come to me for help many times,
and I've never let you down.

476
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,926
You've asked me to do crazy things,

477
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:43,117
and I've always taken your side.

478
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,266
Please, help me.

479
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,787
I can't do this by myself.

480
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,487
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,556
I can't.

482
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:02,821
Not this time.

483
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:04,370
Not me.

484
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,285
- Look what I made!
- Let me see.

485
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:27,335
That's Daddy. That's Mommy.

486
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,296
And that's me and that's you.
See? That's you, Grandpa.

487
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:32,089
It's beautiful, sweetheart.

488
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,846
Dad, we need to talk.

489
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,442
Why don't you get Daddy to put you
in the car seat? We're ready to go.

490
00:26:43,577 --> 00:26:44,518
What's wrong?

491
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:46,187
I spoke to Chloe.

492
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,397
- She told me what's happening.
- Chloe called you?

493
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,163
No, I called her because you wouldn't
tell me what was going on,

494
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,069
so I decided to find out for myself.

495
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:55,821
I know about the threat
to the peace conference,

496
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,533
that CTU might have the wrong suspect.
What's happening?

497
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,924
Chloe had me make her case
to the head of CTU.

498
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,537
He wasn't convinced,
and he thinks he's got the right person.

499
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:04,942
But if he's wrong,

500
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:08,012
then there's still someone inside the UN
who's working with this assassin?

501
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:09,961
That's what Chloe thinks.

502
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:12,028
What do you think?

503
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:14,046
I think it's not my problem.

504
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,551
- Dad!
- What?

505
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,866
I don't believe you.

506
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:20,429
I've never known you to walk away
from something like this.

507
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,712
If you have to stay, it's all right.
You're not letting me down.

508
00:27:26,075 --> 00:27:28,980
- I understand.
- Sweetheart, I want to go with you.

509
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,338
I know you do.

510
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:33,025
And there's nothing I want more
than for you to come with us.

511
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,362
I have been waiting so long
for this day.

512
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,864
We both have.

513
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,284
But if something terrible happens,

514
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,705
and you could have done something
to stop it,

515
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:46,163
I don't think you'd be able to
live with yourself.

516
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,614
Dad,

517
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:55,489
it's okay. You can go.

518
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,002
As soon as I'm finished here,

519
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,446
I will get on a plane
and I will be in L.A., I promise.

520
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:23,296
- Just be careful, please.
- Come here.

521
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,185
I will.

522
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:33,382
- I should tell Teri.
- No, no.

523
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:35,391
Let me do it.

524
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:36,923
Go ahead.

525
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:39,113
Go.

526
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:48,945
Go on.

527
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:56,567
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, but we should go.

528
00:28:57,924 --> 00:28:58,694
Sweetie.

529
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:01,440
Grandpa has some work to do.
He can't fly with us.

530
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:05,117
- But he'll come as soon as he can.
- But he said he was coming today.

531
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:07,995
No, not today. But soon, okay?

532
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:09,747
All right, let's go.

533
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,422
We need to find out where he went
after he left Miss Reed's apartment.

534
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,096
Start checking traffic cams.

535
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:35,477
I need to get a baseline on her
respiratory, cardio and dermal response,

536
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,734
so make her comfortable.
Start off with a few softball questions.

537
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:03,298
I think we need a fresh start.

538
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,298
Now, you claim those files
were planted on your computer.

539
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:08,597
Fine. I'm willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

540
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,950
but you need to meet me halfway.
Talk to me.

541
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:14,536
Help me understand your side
of the story. Fair enough?

542
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:19,844
So, when was the first time
you met President Hassan?

543
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:23,835
About six months ago.

544
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:28,238
<i>At a conference of oil ministers.</i>

545
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,587
I requested an interview,
and he agreed.

546
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:35,675
We met in his hotel lobby twice.

547
00:30:37,698 --> 00:30:39,712
Hour, hour and a half,

548
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,621
at the most.

549
00:30:55,248 --> 00:30:58,583
I want to thank you for wanting to
continue our negotiations.

550
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:00,691
I know it's a risk.

551
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:06,166
You are no stranger to making personal
sacrifices for your beliefs.

552
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,264
If the price for peace is my life,

553
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,645
so be it.

554
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,538
We are doing everything in our power
to make sure that that doesn't happen.

555
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:17,036
We've tightened
security measures here,

556
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:21,086
and CTU's top priority is to find
the people who are targeting you.

557
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:22,692
I appreciate that.

558
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:28,788
The woman you took into custody...

559
00:31:29,374 --> 00:31:31,857
- The reporter. Meredith Reed.
- Yes.

560
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:34,433
Is CTU certain
that she is part of this plan?

561
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:37,026
From what I understand,

562
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:39,814
the evidence against her
is quite incriminating.

563
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,575
Have they found out her reasons?

564
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,876
Miss Reed is being questioned
as we speak.

565
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:46,533
I'll make sure
whatever information we get from her

566
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:49,156
will be shared with your people
as soon as possible.

567
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,584
I've searched through
all the traffic cams

568
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,775
within a five-block radius
of Meredith's apartment.

569
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,798
There's no sign of
where the suspect went.

570
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,930
- Can you check other sources?
- CTU has drones all over the city.

571
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:08,623
I could look their archives
see if they picked anything up.

572
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:09,739
Where are they?

573
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:12,555
The archives are in Arlo's station.
I don't have the clearance.

574
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:14,246
Can you hack in?

575
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:18,753
Do it.

576
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,204
I'm glad you're here.
Thanks for staying.

577
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,529
This will all be over soon
and you can get to California.

578
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,285
Okay. I'm in.

579
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:39,887
One of the drones picked him up
leaving Reed's apartment.

580
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,482
Play it forward.

581
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,675
Well, he hailed a cab when he left.

582
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:53,137
- Can you track the cab?
- It's beyond the drone's search grid.

583
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:54,722
Okay, back it up.

584
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:58,007
Stop.

585
00:32:58,691 --> 00:32:59,863
Move in closer.

586
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:02,709
There, that's what I want to see.

587
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:04,023
Closer.

588
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:06,230
See the medallion?

589
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,031
Call the cab, find out where it went.
I'm not tracking him without a weapon.

590
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,595
The Armory's on Level C.

591
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,908
I have to input your palm print
through the hand scanner.

592
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:16,306
Erase this as soon as I'm clear.

593
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,817
I'll call you
as soon as I'm on the road.

594
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,482
Hello?

595
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:47,968
Ruth, it's me.

596
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,552
- Jenny?
- I need to talk to you, are you alone?

597
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:52,297
Just my kid.
What's going on?

598
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:54,417
Haven't heard from you
since Christmas.

599
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:56,493
Kevin Wade found me.

600
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:59,787
He's been calling me
at work the last two days.

601
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:03,290
Damn it, Ruth,
you told him how to find me?

602
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:04,917
No, I didn't!

603
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,269
You're the only one
who knows the truth.

604
00:34:07,394 --> 00:34:09,296
The only one who knows where I am.

605
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,757
I never talked to him.
I didn't know he was out of jail.

606
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,142
- Then how did he find me?
- <i>I don't know!</i>

607
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,674
And what does he want, anyway?
Why is he calling you?

608
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:23,432
He didn't say.

609
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,855
But he's threatening to tell everyone
the truth about me.

610
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,783
It'll destroy my career.

611
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,389
I'm about to get married, Ruth.

612
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,951
To a really great guy.

613
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,863
There's gotta be something you can do.
You can't let him ruin your life.

614
00:34:45,703 --> 00:34:47,403
I don't know what to do.

615
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,618
I'm afraid
I'm gonna lose everything.

616
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:57,494
I gotta go, I'll call you later.

617
00:35:01,904 --> 00:35:03,767
Where you been?
I've been trying to find you.

618
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,915
Did you decrypt the file?

619
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,056
I'm still working on it.
I found something weird, though.

620
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:12,314
Someone hacked into my station
and it came

621
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,227
from inside CTU.

622
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:19,016
- What were they doing?
- Scanning the drone archives.

623
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,466
Track it down,

624
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:26,248
see who it was.

625
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:39,391
And when you were in B'Dar,
profiling President Hassan,

626
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:42,829
were you ever approached by anyone
who was hostile to his regime?

627
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:44,534
No one paid you?

628
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:46,893
Pressured you into cooperating?

629
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,018
I said no.

630
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:52,274
So all you did was interview
President Hassan, that's it?

631
00:35:55,397 --> 00:35:56,327
That's all.

632
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,337
<i>Her answer prompted
a level-five autonomic reaction.</i>

633
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,244
You're lying.

634
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,914
- I'm not. I...
- Tell me what really happened in B'Dar!

635
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,374
How is it connected
to the assassination plot?

636
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,433
I don't have anything to do
with any plan

637
00:36:12,558 --> 00:36:14,269
to assassinate President Hassan.

638
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,945
- My God, why would I?
- Your reasons are irrelevant.

639
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,885
All I care about
is stopping the assassin.

640
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,053
So do I.

641
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,790
So if someone really
is trying to kill Hassan,

642
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,822
you need to stop wasting your time on me
and find them.

643
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:42,366
Mike, what's going on?

644
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,130
Maggie, I'm so sorry
for dropping by without calling first.

645
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,394
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure, come on.

646
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,455
Did Jim leave for work yet?

647
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,500
- Just got out of the shower.
- Good.

648
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,548
'Cause I need to ask him something.

649
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,016
Kind of a favor.

650
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:00,766
Babe?

651
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:03,453
Mike Farmer's here.
Says he needs to talk to you.

652
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:04,578
Mikey!

653
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,482
You're not on shift till tomorrow.

654
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,142
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

655
00:37:10,267 --> 00:37:11,643
I'll be right down.

656
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:12,938
Take your time.

657
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,756
- Want coffee?
- Sure.

658
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:18,819
<i>... during President Taylor's
press conference earlier.</i>

659
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,642
<i>I wouldn't want to speculate
at this time, Bob, but as you know,</i>

660
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:24,717
<i>President Taylor's
peace negotiations</i>

661
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:28,203
<i>with IRK president Omar Hassan
are highly controversial...</i>

662
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,105
Sit down.
Thanks.

663
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,879
Did you hear
anything more about what happened?

664
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:39,548
Only what they're saying on TV.

665
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:40,831
I gotta tell you,

666
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:42,878
I'm so proud of you and Jim and...

667
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,606
all those boys down at the precinct.

668
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,306
You're gonna be part of history.

669
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:48,954
I don't know.

670
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,393
We're just directing traffic,
really.

671
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,711
You're on the UN security detail.

672
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:56,204
That's more than directing traffic.

673
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:57,816
You might even get on TV.

674
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,818
Wouldn't that be something.

675
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:00,986
It would!

676
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,328
Right.

677
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:12,581
I need to speak with Mr. Hastings.

678
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:15,459
- We're in session.
- It's important.

679
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,643
<i>Excuse me,
I have Dana Walsh out here.</i>

680
00:38:18,768 --> 00:38:20,510
<i>She says it's important.</i>

681
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,712
You're not leaving this room...

682
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,803
until you tell me the truth.

683
00:38:27,622 --> 00:38:29,923
No matter how long it takes.

684
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,863
I'm sorry,
but I didn't think that this could wait.

685
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:46,406
What's this about?

686
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:48,537
Jack Bauer.

687
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,855
I spoke with the dispatcher.

688
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,371
His driver logged the drop-off
at West 23rd Street

689
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:36,641
at the northwest corner
of Broadway in Queens.

690
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:38,667
Anything more specific?
An address?

691
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,504
No, but I'll keep sifting
through the aerial footage.

692
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,130
Broadway and West 23rd.

693
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,006
I'll call you when I get there.

694
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:46,842
Hands in the air!
Now!

695
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,360
Against the wall!

696
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Don't move.

697
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:03,608
He had this.

698
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,168
We'll take it from here.
Stand down.

699
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,267
I told you to leave this alone.

700
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:13,118
Chloe tracked the man in the photo
to a second location.

701
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,078
We didn't think
you'd follow through.

702
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,331
So you steal
weapons from the armory.

703
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,364
Would you have followed through
if I'd asked?

704
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:20,751
I'm not debating.

705
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,972
You shut down a lead before you could
assess whether it was good or bad.

706
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:25,630
Take him to detention.

707
00:40:28,205 --> 00:40:29,092
Take him!

708
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,059
Let's go.

709
00:40:30,184 --> 00:40:32,371
I'm sure President Taylor
will be interested to find out

710
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,462
- what happened to my informant.
- Excuse me?

711
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:37,893
Cole tried to secure
that landing zone with more men,

712
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,077
but you sent a drone, which failed.

713
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:42,105
My informant
and two of your men are dead.

714
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,441
Cole hasn't said anything about it.

715
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,611
And neither will I,
as long as you let me pursue this.

716
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,404
So now you're blackmailing me?

717
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,489
You forced my hand,
now I'm forcing yours.

718
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,325
You don't want to this.

719
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,037
I wanna be on a plane to Los Angeles.
But you're not giving me another choice.

720
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,317
You want to waste your time
chasing ghosts? Knock yourself out.

721
00:41:05,893 --> 00:41:08,586
I've got to stop an assassination plot.
Give him the bag.

722
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,172
I need Chloe to run ops.

723
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:14,493
Fine, she's all yours.

724
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:16,834
Thank you.

725
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:24,689
Anything to what he's talking about?

726
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:28,019
The only viable lead
is sitting in our interrogation room.

727
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:30,835
And she's the only way
we're going to get to the assassin.

728
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,076
What's going on?

729
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,893
Listen, something came up.

730
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:43,500
I can't make my shift tomorrow.
So, I was wondering if we could swap.

731
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,895
I'd be happy to, except Maggie and me
have a meeting with Sean's teacher.

732
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:50,203
She said he's acting out in class,
but I don't believe it.

733
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:52,380
Jim keeps making excuses for him,

734
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:54,344
but if he needs help,
I want to give it.

735
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:55,618
Where is he?

736
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:57,293
He's at his grandma's tonight.

737
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,623
I'm not making excuses.

738
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:03,421
So, what are you saying?

739
00:42:04,142 --> 00:42:06,190
You can't trade shifts with me?

740
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,608
This is kind of important,
so I'm sorry.

741
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:14,641
Me, too.

742
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:20,287
I want you to sit down.

743
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,500
There's a roll of tape in my bag.

744
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,903
Tear off a strip
and put it over Maggie's mouth.

745
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:34,141
Do it.

746
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:56,759
I'm sorry, baby.

747
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:00,993
Now,

748
00:43:01,118 --> 00:43:03,830
pick up the phone,
call Captain Ravello.

749
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:07,167
Tell him you're sick
and I'm filling in for you.

750
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:09,336
Now, listen, there's no way...

751
00:43:10,495 --> 00:43:12,231
What's the matter with you?

752
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,507
What are you doing?!

753
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:16,094
Next time, I won't miss the bone.

754
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:19,993
Make...

755
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:21,097
the call.

756
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:22,518
All right.

757
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:24,142
All right, I'll call.

758
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:26,734
Please, just leave my wife alone,
all right?
