3
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>Mr. Bauer, you are ordered</i>

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,517
<i>to turn the aircraft around
and return to CTU.</i>

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,727
Jack's descending.

6
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,145
Choppers are in pursuit.

7
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:25,733
<i>We've lost him.</i>

8
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,611
If Jack gets this evidence
and exposes the Russians,

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,334
the agreement is over.

10
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,406
The agreement
may not be the only casualty.

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,867
You covered up
the Russians' involvement.

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,753
That's grounds for impeachment.

13
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:38,663
There's still a chance that CTU

14
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,997
will find Jack.

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,583
Even if they do,
the evidence is still out there.

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,668
Eventually, it will surface.

17
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,251
You need to control the evidence
by keeping Walsh off the grid.

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,593
Classify her as an enemy combatant

19
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,304
and incarcerate her
in a private facility.

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,555
I've authorized

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,265
a private interrogation team

22
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,685
to acquire the evidence.
Once we have it,

23
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,436
she'll be irrelevant.

24
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:04,522
I can't be a part
of this any longer.

25
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:07,400
Cite my health as the reason
for my resignation.

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,820
The president's ordered your transfer
to an off-site facility.

27
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,530
What do you mean?

28
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:14,198
It's a secure location.

29
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,533
Just do what he says.

30
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,887
Chloe, don't let them do this.

31
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,170
- Let's go.
- Please.

32
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,038
They're gonna kill me. Chloe!

33
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,406
Chloe, please!

34
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,458
You told Bauer you have evidence.

35
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:28,170
I have got nothing to tell you.
There is no evidence.

36
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,424
The sooner you tell me,
the easier it'll go.

37
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,635
Mobilizing a sting operation

38
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,220
to be led by Agent Ortiz.

39
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,805
The target is Jack Bauer.

40
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,559
Put your weapons down!

41
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,935
I can't do that!

42
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,066
Put your weapons down now!

43
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,690
I need you to help me
gain access to Walsh.

44
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,521
I am giving you an opportunity
to make this right,

45
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:53,696
to make the people that are responsible
for everything that happened today.

46
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:57,116
Chloe said she's in a safe house
a few miles from here.

47
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,577
Now it's imperative
that they think I took you hostage.

48
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:01,263
Get up!

49
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:13,962
And though fate has prevented
my husband from being here today

50
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,537
at the culmination
of his life's work,

51
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,861
I know that he is watching us now,

52
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:22,199
looking down and guiding us

53
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:26,603
as we take the last steps
towards this historic agreement.

54
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,360
Finally, I would like
to express my gratitude

55
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:37,242
to President Taylor...

56
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,609
whose integrity

57
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,511
and moral courage
have been unshakable

58
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,395
during the long course
of these negotiations.

59
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:53,255
She is someone on whom
my husband built an absolute trust.

60
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,669
And I want to make it clear

61
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:00,552
that her efforts and the efforts
of the United States government

62
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:03,941
to rescue him
were nothing short of heroic.

63
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,670
My husband wasn't perfect.

64
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,604
None of us is.

65
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,695
But he carried a perfect idea
in his heart:

66
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,500
that peace is possible.

67
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:28,582
On this,

68
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,709
<i>the last day of his life,</i>

69
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,083
<i>may the world come together</i>

70
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,443
<i>and prove that he was right.</i>

71
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,182
What a magnificent woman.

72
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:53,026
- Who was that on the phone?
- Bledsoe.

73
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,201
It's not the best of news, sir.

74
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:57,278
Dana Walsh isn't being
as cooperative as hoped.

75
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:02,116
She's a trained enemy agent,
she's not gonna to break easily.

76
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,188
I told President Taylor
what might be necessary,

77
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,705
and she signed off on it.

78
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,414
Bledsoe's a professional, sir.

79
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,089
I'm confident
he'll come through for us.

80
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:13,569
He better.

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,030
There was one more thing.

82
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,385
Bledsoe wanted confirmation.

83
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:21,635
About what?

84
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:24,829
How to deal with Ms. Walsh,
post interrogation.

85
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,962
- I thought we settled that matter.
- We did.

86
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:28,851
So why's he asking?

87
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,569
To double check
we're committed to the same outcome.

88
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:32,969
And what did you tell him?

89
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:35,024
We're still committed
to the same outcome.

90
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,056
Not that I have any idea
what you're talking about.

91
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:41,697
You understand?

92
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:43,532
Perfectly.

93
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,004
Let her up.

94
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:08,307
I'll give you a little tip.
Take short, shallow breaths.

95
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,075
You'll recover faster.

96
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,547
And then we won't have so much
downtime between sessions.

97
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,827
It's up to you, you know.

98
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:19,612
You can stop this whenever you want.

99
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,899
All you have to do
is tell me what I want to know.

100
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,667
I told you that I was making it up.

101
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,284
There is no evidence.

102
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,037
You told Jack Bauer
you had proof that elements

103
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,168
in the Russian government were behind
the assassination of Hassan.

104
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,543
I was bluffing.

105
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:37,002
Stalling for time.
There isn't any proof.

106
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:39,588
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

107
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,757
We begin again in ten seconds.

108
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,598
Seven, six...

109
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,856
Bring it on, you son of a bitch.

110
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,131
Put her down.

111
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:58,159
Where's the evidence?

112
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:00,234
Go to hell.

113
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:01,527
Gag her.

114
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,968
They got two sentries
out in front in a black sedan,

115
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:43,415
one lookout on the roof,
maybe another across the street,

116
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,785
but I couldn't see him.

117
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,874
We can access the back
through that alley.

118
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,949
So, once we get Dana, what then?

119
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:52,555
As painful as it is, we got to cut
a deal in exchange for the evidence.

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,205
- You mean let her go.
- Cole, we both lost friends today.

121
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,751
And Dana had a hand in that,
but only a hand.

122
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:02,296
If we can get the people in charge,
the people that gave the orders,

123
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,864
it'll be worth it.

124
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:08,253
It's Chloe.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,858
Answer it or she'll know
something's wrong.

126
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:12,306
If she doesn't already.

127
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:14,725
Cole, what's your ETA?

128
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:18,141
Ten minutes. FDR Drive was a mess.
We're coming up First Ave instead.

129
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:19,616
Is Jack with you?

130
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,400
I got him.
He's locked down in the back.

131
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,850
I'm glad we found him
before he got hurt.

132
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:26,901
Or worse.

133
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,234
I've known Jack for a long time,
I've never seen him like this.

134
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,869
He threatened me.
He's never done that before.

135
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,500
You did the right thing.

136
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,544
Thanks for saying that.

137
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:45,008
<i>I'll talk to you when you get here.</i>

138
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:46,882
We're good.

139
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,349
She has no idea.

140
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:51,117
Don't be too hard on her.

141
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:53,430
- She wants the best for you.
- I know.

142
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,717
Almost forgot.

143
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,602
You're gonna need these.

144
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,692
I'm sorry, I just couldn't
take the chance.

145
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:07,861
Son of a bitch.

146
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:09,738
Yeah, I know.

147
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:12,574
- You ready?
- Yeah.

148
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,009
Let's go.

149
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:19,628
Keep your head down.

150
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,249
Go.

151
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,922
That's right, four hours prior
to the signing ceremony,

152
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:40,491
all available field units
will be redeployed to the UN.

153
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:43,061
Mobile HQ is being
set up on the first floor,

154
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:46,859
near the high commissioner's offices.
Hold on, O'Brian is on the other line.

155
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:49,236
Who's the psych officer?

156
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,602
That would be Melissa Anderson.

157
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,825
She did all the grief counseling
last night.

158
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,874
Make sure
she's the first person Jack sees.

159
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,438
I want a complete eval.

160
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,210
You think that's necessary?

161
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:01,179
I wouldn't have ordered it
if I didn't.

162
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,449
I'll let her know.

163
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,131
They got one man on the roof.

164
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:13,410
Wait till I get into position,
then you draw them out.

165
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,088
<i>Unit two. Street's clear.</i>

166
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,138
<i>Unit three. Back alley's clear.</i>

167
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:35,163
Command, this is unit four.
Roof's clear.

168
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,177
All units, copy that.
Stay alert.

169
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,638
We're clear.

170
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,628
Let's go.

171
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:55,023
You make that cover.
I'll draw him out.

172
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,327
I'm taking sniper fire on the roof.

173
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:08,829
<i>Across the street.</i>

174
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,997
- <i>I need backup now.</i>
- Unit four, stand by.

175
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,625
- <i>I'm sending backup now.</i>
- Copy that. Hurry!

176
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,245
<i>All units to the roof.</i>

177
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,122
<i>Unit four is reporting sniper fire.</i>

178
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,901
Command, we're on the roof.
It's quiet, there's no sign of Mullins.

179
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,076
<i>Come again?</i>

180
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:54,875
All's quiet,
but we can locate Unit four.

181
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,501
Unit four, come in, please.

182
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,853
Where's Dana Walsh?

183
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,020
Where is she?

184
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,677
<i>Mullins is down, sir.</i>

185
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:07,012
Last chance.

186
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,639
- <i>Repeat, Mullins is down.</i>
- First room on the left.

187
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,640
Thank you.

188
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,893
<i>Do you copy?</i>

189
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:15,979
<i>Come in.</i>

190
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,336
We're clear.

191
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,786
The first room on the left,
I've got it.

192
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,904
- Put your gun down!
- Drop your weapon or I'll kill her!

193
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,701
I'll kill you, if I have to.

194
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,869


195
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,705
You won't take the shot.
It's too risky. I'll kill her before...

196
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:36,875
Untie her.

197
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:41,546


198
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:46,019
Take her out the back.
We're gonna get company soon.

199
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,144
Hurry!

200
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,138
- Have you got her?
- Almost!

201
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,727
I got her!

202
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,895
Move!

203
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,098
Stay covered.

204
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,953
Take the stairs now!

205
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,081
Get going!
I'll be right behind you!

206
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,918
Just finishing rescanning
the field reports.

207
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,279
You need to hear this.

208
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,989
Agent Beck just checked in.

209
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,449
He said he's been locked down
for the past half hour,

210
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,951
just managed to free himself.

211
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,245
- What?
- Jack didn't fall for the trap.

212
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,914
Instead, he reversed the entire squad
and took Cole hostage.

213
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,874
- I just talked to Cole.
- Beck says

214
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,585
Jack had him at gunpoint.

215
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,506
Pull up the satellite
on the address: 1463312th Street.

216
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,677
It's where they're holding Dana.
It's where Jack's on his way to now.

217
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:12,304
What is going on?

218
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,897
He's been two steps ahead of me.

219
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:16,488
He probably knew
what I was gonna do before I did.

220
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,085
Hello, everybody!
Can I have your attention, please?

221
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:22,480
Jack Bauer's
no longer in custody of CTU.

222
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:25,358
Agent Ortiz is with him,
most likely as a hostage.

223
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,993
Our priority is to find them now.

224
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,072
- Satellite's online.
- Put it up.

225
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,119
Too late. Put the APB

226
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,829
back out on Jack, all agencies.

227
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,647
Get me the White House.

228
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:45,587
- Where are we going?
- You tell me.

229
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:48,465
You had a file implicating
people in the Russian government

230
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,629
who are responsible
for Renee's murder.

231
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:52,104
I want that file.

232
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,138
And I said I'd give it to you
in exchange for immunity.

233
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:56,682
That deal's off the table.

234
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,059
The President decided
the agreement's more important.

235
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:02,228
As far as she's concerned, that file
can never see the light of day.

236
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:03,736
But I still want it.

237
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:08,318
- What's the new deal?
- You give us the file, we let you go.

238
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,231
Go where, Riker's Island?

239
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:13,406
You're a small fish. I'm going
after the people who gave the orders.

240
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,785
You give me the evidence,
we'll let you go. I give you my word.

241
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:18,196
Your word?

242
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:21,623
I'm sorry.
I don't believe you, Jack.

243
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,541
Fine.

244
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:25,251
You think it's a joke?

245
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,212
We'll do it another way.

246
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,311
Get out. Get out!

247
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,188
Tell me where that file is. Now!

248
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:54,864
- It's the only thing keeping me alive!
- No, right now

249
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,626
I'm the only thing
keeping you alive.

250
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:59,119
I'm gonna count backwards from 3,
then I'm gonna kill you.

251
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,122
You're really not gonna
let him shoot me, are you?

252
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:03,746
Back off!

253
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,334
In a safety-deposit box!

254
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,627
Where?

255
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,183
First Unity Savings. Cole knows.
We have a joint account.

256
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:12,882
But the box is in my name,
I'm the only one who can access it.

257
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:15,510
- Where's the bank?
- Lexington, off East 59th.

258
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,584
I had nothing to do
with Renee's death.

259
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,474
- I didn't even know she was a target.
- Put her in the car.

260
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,918
Damn it! You see what's
happening here, don't you?

261
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:27,063
- He's using you.
- Using me? You're using me.

262
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,023
What do you think he's gonna do?

263
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,068
He's gonna give the file to the press
and expose everyone responsible.

264
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,150
Is that what you think?
'Cause I doubt that's what Jack thinks.

265
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,038
He's gonna
make a list of the guilty,

266
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:39,325
then he's gonna execute them,
starting with me.

267
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,174
This isn't about the truth.
It's about revenge!

268
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:48,942
I can't do this!

269
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,345
She's trying
to get inside your head.

270
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,934
I know that, damn it!

271
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,019
You got something you want to say to me,
you better say it now.

272
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,898
Were you gonna pull that trigger?

273
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,887
I need her to think I would.

274
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:48,633


275
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,648
Please allow me
to offer my condolences for your loss.

276
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,691
- Your husband was a great man.
- Thank you.

277
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,112
How has news of his death
been received back in the IRK?

278
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:00,879
And do people there
generally support

279
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:03,682
your decision to take his place
as head of state?

280
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:08,305
I'm confident that most of my country
is behind me.

281
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:13,001
Those who aren't, probably
never supported my husband's policies.

282
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,220
And what are your plans
after the treaty is signed?

283
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:19,363
Right now,
I'm concentrating all my efforts

284
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:22,345
on the pursuit of finishing
what my husband started.

285
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:25,707
But I want to return to Kamistan...

286
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:27,016
Is this true?

287
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,476
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

288
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,687
The details are sketchy,
but as of 15 minutes ago,

289
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,738
Jack Bauer stormed the safe house,

290
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:35,575
overwhelmed security
and took Dana Walsh.

291
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,534
Do we have any idea where they are?

292
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,821
A hard target search is under way.

293
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,115
Your note mentioned Charles Logan.

294
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,240
He's been demanding to speak to you.

295
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:47,044
He insisted that I interrupt
the press conference.

296
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,588
- All you'll have to do is hit redial.
- Thank you.

297
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:53,218
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.

298
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,246
<i>... the body be ritually washed
and draped...</i>

299
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,887
<i>How in God's name
could this have happened?</i>

300
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,174
The important thing is not to panic.

301
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,667
<i>You assured me that Dana Walsh</i>

302
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,583
<i>would be more secure in the hands</i>

303
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,555
- <i>of your private contractors.</i>
- We didn't move her out of CTU

304
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,358
solely for security reasons,

305
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,221
<i>as I'm sure you remember.</i>

306
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,738
Do you have me on speaker?

307
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,717
<i>Pick up the damn phone.</i>

308
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,118
Forgive me, I wasn't thinking.

309
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,653
Apparently, neither was I.

310
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:33,231
It's a little late for buyer's remorse,
Madam President,

311
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:37,380
especially because I was calling
with a solution

312
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,038
to our current problem.

313
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:43,089
Bauer may have Walsh,
but he can't have the evidence yet.

314
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,172
We've still got a chance
to stop him.

315
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:47,982
- How?
- By putting somebody inside CTU,

316
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,988
someone whose loyalties
aren't split,

317
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:53,922
who won't hesitate
to see the mission through

318
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,357
no matter what the cost.

319
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,157
I've already replaced one director.
I can't replace another.

320
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:02,127
No, not a new director. Just someone
to supervise the manhunt for Bauer.

321
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:03,820
I'm recommending Jason Pillar.

322
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:05,247
Your aide?

323
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,533
He's Bureau-trained.

324
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,817
He was second in command at DIA
during the Daniel's administration

325
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:13,249
and he made a name for himself
in Afghanistan,

326
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,413
chasing high-value targets
behind enemy lines.

327
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:21,130
Of course if you have a better idea,

328
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,881
<i>I'll gladly take a step back.</i>

329
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:24,690
- Madam.
- Just a second.

330
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:26,970
- What is it?
- Mrs. Hassan is finishing up.

331
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,568
I'm on my way.

332
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:33,725
Look,

333
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:37,647
I'll tell Tim Woods that I support you
making an operational change.

334
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,665
But that's it, Charles...
no more excuses.

335
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,820
Thank you, Madame President.
And allow me to say that...

336
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,659
No, I understand completely.

337
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,945
And I appreciate
your confidence in Jason.

338
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,476
- How soon can you leave for CTU?
- Immediately.

339
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:59,073
Good. I'll handle the arrangements
on this end.

340
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,419
<i>... in over late husband Omar Hassan</i>

341
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:19,982
<i>in an address to the press and members
of an international delegation</i>

342
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,816
<i>at the United Nations.</i>

343
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,885
Congratulations, Charles.

344
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,575
You have recast yourself
as the great peacemaker.

345
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:29,198
I appreciate your help
in getting me this far, Mikhail.

346
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,448
So tell me what I'm doing here?

347
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:38,918
I had hoped
to have this conversation in private.

348
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,854
This is my attaché Pavel Tokarev.

349
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:43,408
You can speak freely.

350
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,490
He is more than well acquainted
with the situation.

351
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:55,602
There's been an unforeseen problem.

352
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:59,030
Apparently I'm not the only one
who can prove that elements

353
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:01,606
in your government conspired
to undermine the peace process.

354
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:03,051
Meaning?

355
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,877
The mole you installed inside CTU,

356
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,863
claims to have evidence
to that effect.

357
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,114
Not possible.

358
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:13,659
She was handled
with complete deniability.

359
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:15,578
So you say.

360
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:17,659
But, no one in this room

361
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,458
can take the chance
that she's bluffing.

362
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:22,794
Now... I tried to contain this.

363
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:26,921
I had Ms. Walsh detained
and interrogated.

364
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:29,967
The problem is,
Jack Bauer just broke her out.

365
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:33,319
Apparently,
he has a personal interest

366
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,841
in exposing this evidence.

367
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,791
Then you need to stop him.

368
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:41,771
Surely President Taylor
is motivated to do the same.

369
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,313
She is, to a point.

370
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,788
But I know Bauer.

371
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:48,692
And I can promise you
he will never let this go.

372
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,921
And I don't think

373
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:55,231
the president is willing to do
what is ultimately required.

374
00:24:56,644 --> 00:24:58,910
So you expect me
to kill Bauer for you?

375
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:00,039
We both know

376
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,501
you have the covert assets here
to do the job.

377
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,156
Maybe I do...

378
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:12,291
but I don't have the resources
to find him, track him.

379
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:13,719
CTU does.

380
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:17,807
And the man in charge
of the search now reports to me.

381
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:21,432
How would this work?

382
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:27,913
This is a closed-channel phone.

383
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:30,686
It's impossible to intercept.

384
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:33,072
My man at CTU will use it to feed

385
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,389
your people real-time information
as to Bauer's whereabouts.

386
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:41,384
And they can put an end
to this problem, once and for all.

387
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:05,209
We have to assume that CTU's
been getting my face out there.

388
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:07,297
You'll have to take her
into the bank alone.

389
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:10,334
I'll stand sentry in the lobby.
How well do you know the layout inside?

390
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:12,796
Vault's in the back.
Tellers are on one side of the room,

391
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,323
loan officers are on the other.

392
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,408
One of them's an old buddy of mine.
He was helping us line up a mortgage.

393
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,950
You keep her
inside your strike zone.

394
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:22,872
If she sees an opportunity,
she'll take it. Do not trust her.

395
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,415
I'll be fine, Jack.

396
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:26,139
Okay, let's go.

397
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,796
You hate me right now,
but I don't really believe

398
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,363
- you want to see me executed.
- Save it.

399
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:36,579
We both saw how close he came
to pulling the trigger back there.

400
00:26:36,704 --> 00:26:38,549
That's just
what he wanted you to think.

401
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:40,484
If that's what he told you,
he's lying.

402
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:42,950
Just like he's lying
about what he'll do with that file.

403
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:45,985
Jack wants to bring the people
responsible for this to justice.

404
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,235
- Just like me.
- Who do you think they are?

405
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,441
They're Russian diplomats
with diplomatic immunity.

406
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:53,836
They'll be indicted by the World Court
and hauled up in front of the Hague.

407
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:56,970
You really believe he wants to trust
some toothless international tribunal

408
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,178
to mete out justice to the people
who killed Renee?

409
00:26:59,303 --> 00:27:00,860
- Come on.
- You're hurting me.

410
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,085
You'll live.

411
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,791
Confirm all traffic camera feeds
are being ported through us.

412
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,556
Up-res and route everything
through facial recognition.

413
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:47,945
Parameter-matching
on Jack, Cole, or Dana.

414
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,085
We don't have anywhere
near the bandwidth to do that citywide.

415
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,157
Then job the overflow to NSA.

416
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,425
Where are we on setting up
the search grid with NYPD?

417
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,123
In process. They're giving us
the personnel they can spare,

418
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:03,179
but they're going on record that,
unless we narrow down the search area,

419
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:05,062
it's "needle in a haystack" time.

420
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,698
There's a Jason Pillar
on his way to see you.

421
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:16,068
Tim Wood's office pre-cleared him.

422
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,306
Send him up.

423
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,534
<i>He's already on his way.
He wouldn't wait.</i>

424
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,366
Never heard of him.
Who is he?

425
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,015
He was second in command at DIA
under Daniel.

426
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,451
He's been working
the private sector for years.

427
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:33,252
This is my associate Eden Linley.

428
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,339
So why are you here?

429
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:40,430
The White House is unhappy with the way
the manhunt's been handled.

430
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,404
President Taylor's issued
an executive order

431
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:44,221
placing me in charge of the search.

432
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:47,471
You'll retain your current position
for the time being

433
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:49,894
with authority
over all over CTU operations.

434
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:52,705
Arlo, give us a minute?

435
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:54,013
You got it.

436
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:59,093
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Excuse me?

437
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:00,272
Why are you here?

438
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,281
You have nothing to do
with H.S. anymore.

439
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,785
All you need to know is that I'm here
under the president's orders.

440
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,662
You're wasting your time.
We've done all we can.

441
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,916
If that were true, then the trap
you set for Bauer would have worked.

442
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,043
- It's complicated.
- You were more concerned

443
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,158
not to hurt him.
It's all in the hourlies.

444
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,297
In fact,
the last operational command

445
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:20,844
you sent to Agent Ortiz was,

446
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,293
"Remember, non-lethal force. "

447
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:25,396
Not exactly
the appropriate sentiment

448
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,890
when the president told you
to stop Bauer.

449
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,417
She doesn't want to hurt him.

450
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,685
You both know
what he'd done for this country.

451
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,003
What Bauer's doing
will destroy the peace agreement.

452
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,775
And the president
cannot let that happen.

453
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:41,987
It's time
to take off the kid gloves.

454
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,534
We need protocols and encryption keys
transferred to us immediately.

455
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,433
As well as system overrides
and administrative privileges.

456
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:50,913
Understood?

457
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,418
Yeah, understood.

458
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,079
Re-code the all-agency bulletin
on Bauer

459
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:04,715
to "armed and dangerous"
level eight.

460
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:08,129
And change the use of force guidelines
to "unrestricted. "

461
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,985
Here we go.
Just make yourselves comfortable.

462
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,447
I'll be right back
with your safety deposit box.

463
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Let's go.

464
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:48,056
Something funny?

465
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:51,027
This.

466
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:55,060
You and me... it's not the way
that it was supposed to turn out.

467
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:57,620
I'm serious, Cole.

468
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,359
Now that this is all over,
you deserve to hear the truth.

469
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:05,498
It's a little late for the truth.

470
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:07,257
If you're even capable of it.

471
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,658
You don't have to believe me.

472
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,660
I was a kid.

473
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:16,123
A kid with five years of prison
behind me and no future to speak of.

474
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:19,696
A guy came to see me...
a Russian.

475
00:31:20,516 --> 00:31:22,882
Said that he could give me
a fresh start.

476
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:27,129
I had absolutely no idea
what I was getting myself into.

477
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,720
You could have come clean
anytime you wanted.

478
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,560
And go back to jail.
Not a chance.

479
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,101
Look, I know
that it's not an excuse,

480
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,244
but ever since I met you

481
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:42,414
I have been trying to dig myself out
of this mess that I'm in.

482
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:44,778
You're right...

483
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:46,779
I don't believe you.

484
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:49,575
It's why I made that video file.

485
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,964
I was going to use it as leverage
to get the Russians to leave us alone.

486
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:54,965
Us?

487
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,865
There is no "us," Dana.

488
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,699
There never was.

489
00:32:00,576 --> 00:32:02,545
It was a lie from the beginning.

490
00:32:03,995 --> 00:32:05,089
That is not true.

491
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,073
Just stop playing me.
It won't work.

492
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:08,759
I am not playing you.

493
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:11,114
I loved you.

494
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:17,987
Here we go... 14-05.

495
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:20,985
I'll be outside.

496
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,460
Thank you, Brian.

497
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:41,000
You never give up, do you?

498
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:51,127
You guys all right?

499
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,044
911. What is your emergency?

500
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,326
Hi. I'm at First Unity Savings Bank
on Lexington.

501
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:52,619
There's a guy by the front door.
I think I saw him on the news.

502
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:54,674
I think he has a gun.

503
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:58,941
Oh, my God.
He's looking in my direction.

504
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,519
Great. As quickly as you can.

505
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:28,854
The 911 comm center
just confirmed the call.

506
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:30,810
Bauer was supposedly ID'd by someone

507
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,028
at the First Unity Savings Branch
on Lexington.

508
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:36,603
- What do you mean supposedly?
- That all we have is the caller's word

509
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:38,712
that she recognized Jack
from the news coverage.

510
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:41,161
- We don't have secondary confirmation.
- Then get it.

511
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:43,816
Request access to the bank's
video surveillance system.

512
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:46,312
I've already contacted them.
I'm just trying to connect.

513
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:48,717
Having trouble getting
the CTU comm protocols to work.

514
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:51,171
- You, what's your name?
- Devon Rosenthal.

515
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,339
Help her.

516
00:34:53,687 --> 00:34:56,552
Don't look at O'Brian.
I'm giving you the order. Follow it.

517
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,627
All right,
let's see what's going on.

518
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:00,502
All right, this is the...

519
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,268
Got it?

520
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,291
Here we go.

521
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,090
Full access to the bank's
video surveillance system.

522
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:29,887
We got him.

523
00:35:30,282 --> 00:35:32,634
Call NYPD and make sure
they realize the priority here.

524
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:35,296
Tell them I want to be looped
in their operation in real time.

525
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,948
- Got it.
- Be right back.

526
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,405
- Yes?
- <i>We found Bauer.</i>

527
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,734
He's at a bank.
First Unity Savings on Lexington.

528
00:35:54,143 --> 00:35:55,360
How do you know?

529
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:58,447
A 911 call confirmed
by video surveillance.

530
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:02,409
Then the police
are already on their way.

531
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,519
Can't help that.
But once they have Bauer,

532
00:36:04,644 --> 00:36:07,873
I'll find out where they're holding him.
You'll have to take him out there.

533
00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:09,714
I'll wait for your call.

534
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:17,382
Brown jacket, freeze! Police!
Get your hands up!

535
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:19,802
Get your hands up now!
Hands up!

536
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:23,231
On your knees.
Get down on your knees.

537
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:26,517
Put your hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers, thumbs out.

538
00:36:26,904 --> 00:36:27,810
Do not move.

539
00:36:31,697 --> 00:36:32,748
We got him.

540
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,403
Take it easy.
You got no chance.

541
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,531
- We got units coming in.
- Shut up!

542
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,157
You know who I am?

543
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,910
Do you know who I am?!

544
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,049
I don't want to kill your partner,
but I will if I have to.

545
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,675
So here's what we're gonna do:

546
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,043
slowly, you're gonna
put your gun down.

547
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,137
Drop your weapon now!

548
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,280
Kick it over to me.

549
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:06,265
I'm sorry.

550
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:19,416
Call an ambulance now.

551
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,685
Tell them
two police officers are down.

552
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:04,747
Don't you move!

553
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:07,659
Slowly...

554
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,494
turn around and head back to me.

555
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:13,155
Now!

556
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,585
What happened to Cole?

557
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:23,795
Did you kill him?

558
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:26,524
I could never do that.

559
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,605
Where's the evidence?

560
00:40:30,757 --> 00:40:31,845
It's in my pocket.

561
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,221
Show me.

562
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,799
- Jack, we can make a deal.
- Show me!

563
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:48,971
I want you to slowly
put it down on the floor.

564
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,282
Tell me what I can do.

565
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,853
Nothing.

566
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,026
Nothing.
