1
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:17,640
No!

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,652
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

3
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:22,015
<i>He's dead. ETHAN:
Are you telling me</i>

4
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:23,984
that Jack Bauer just killed

5
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:25,986
a United States senator?

6
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,459
How could you have
let this happen?!

7
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,727
Mr. Kanin, you are not going
to lay this one at my feet.

8
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:32,193
What is it, Ethan,
what's wrong?

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,865
<i>Madam President,
I'm afraid I have no choice</i>

10
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:36,020
but to resign as
your chief of staff.

11
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:38,265
You're taking this too far.

12
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:40,307
<i>Where's Jack? MOSS:
We don't have him.</i>

13
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:41,333
<i>RENEE: The man</i>

14
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,802
who framed Jack for
Burnett's murder was

15
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,061
John Quinn,
a Starkwood contractor.

16
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:47,042
Jack went to Mayer
to get the evidence

17
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:48,541
to prove it.

18
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:49,811
Starkwood was involved
with everything

19
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:51,243
that's happened today.
They were the ones

20
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:53,150
that helped Juma and his men
bring down the planes and attack

21
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,242
the White House.

22
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:55,651
In exchange,
they were allowed to develop

23
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,310
and manufacture
a WMD in Sangala.

24
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:00,420
<i>The text message I got off
their agent's cell phone</i>

25
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:02,153
said "Port of Alexandria,

26
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:04,322
lot "C," 10:15 p.m."

27
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,720
Go red, go red! Engage, engage.

28
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:08,762
(gunfire)

29
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,701
<i>STOKES: Get that truck
out of here now!</i>

30
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:18,171
Tony! The truck--

31
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:19,191
I'm going after it!

32
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,270
Cover me now!

33
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:29,080
(grunts)

34
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:32,390
I'm in possession of
a biological weapon

35
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,271
interdicted at the
Port of Alexandria.

36
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:36,753
(beeping)

37
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:43,892
(helicopter rotors whirring,
automatic gunfire)

38
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,000
What's your status?

39
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:53,371
<i>STOKES: Package is secure;
we're inbound.</i>

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,342
What about Bauer?

41
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:55,581
He's at the scene, sir,

42
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:56,913
but he sought cover nearby.

43
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:59,380
We have to assume that he
contacted the authorities,

44
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,660
so we'd better be on an
accelerated timetable.

45
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:03,183
Get over here.

46
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,951
Starkwood reacquired
the bioweapon.

47
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,650
They airlifted the
freight right out of here.

48
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,593
They were headed due west
from my current position.

49
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,022
Jack, I can't assault
a private compound

50
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,813
unless I have proof
that a weapon exists.

51
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,292
Okay, where is the CDC?

52
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,730
They're scrambling
a team right now.

53
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,760
Send them to me.

54
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,533
You'll have all
the proof you need.

55
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:18,533
Jack, what happened?

56
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,663
I was exposed.

57
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,082
We're ready for you,
sir, come with me.

58
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:55,163
WOMAN: Mr. Bauer.

59
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:57,003
Dr. Macer, CDC.

60
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,772
We need you to get undressed.

61
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:04,272
You're the one that
talked to Agent Moss?

62
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:05,642
He brought me up to speed,

63
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:07,412
said you had some information
about the bioweapon.

64
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,910
All I know is that it
was developed in Sangala,

65
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:11,883
and according to rumors
from the village

66
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,083
that it was tested on,

67
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:15,252
all the victims suffered
from dementia and paralysis.

68
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,410
Check neurological
vectors and pathogens.

69
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,191
How much was released?

70
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm not exactly sure.

71
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,800
The weapon was stored in
a pressurized canister.

72
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,601
It was breached for
maybe two minutes

73
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,982
before I could seal it off.

74
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,911
This is not a reaction.

75
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,143
I've had these scars.

76
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,190
This is a full
spectrum antibiotic.

77
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:40,150
It should counteract

78
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:42,193
a wide range of
known pathogens.

79
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,880
Step inside, sir.

80
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:58,193
Raise your arms and
close your eyes.

81
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,442
Janis, where are we?

82
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,213
Metro closed down a six-mile
stretch of Highway 236.

83
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,183
The CDC first responders are on-site.
What the hell's

84
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,683
going on?
One of the bioweapon canisters

85
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,911
was breached.

86
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:19,122
Jack may have been exposed.

87
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:22,022
Oh, my God.
Starkwood took the canisters.

88
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,811
They're probably flying it
back to their main compound

89
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,750
in Virginia,
along with Tony Almeida.

90
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:27,543
Almeida? Yeah,
he was working with Jack.

91
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:28,903
We think he might have
been taken captive.

92
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:30,632
Hang on one second.
I need you to put together

93
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:31,770
a briefing packet on Starkwood.

94
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,400
I want every division
caught up to speed

95
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:34,733
on what we might
be dealing with.

96
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:35,903
You planning to
move on Starkwood?

97
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:37,441
That place is enormous;
it's practically

98
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,412
a military base.
We're not going to do anything

99
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,243
till we have concrete evidence
on the bioweapon from CDC.

100
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:42,710
Then I'll inform the president.

101
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,713
She'll decide how to proceed.

102
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:14,703
??

103
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,381
Almeida's not going to talk.

104
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:30,423
He's not the type;
he's the brave type.

105
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,220
Know the psychology
of your subject.

106
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:36,193
That's in our manual.

107
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,860
Here we go.

108
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,403
Mr. Hodges,

109
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,941
we isolated the
damaged canister.

110
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,471
We got lucky.

111
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:51,071
They know we have the weapons.

112
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:52,242
That's not so lucky.

113
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,512
How fast can you
have them ready?

114
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,541
It's going to take me
at least two hours.

115
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:57,281
Too long, Tom.
Sir, we don't know

116
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:58,392
what the government knows.

117
00:05:58,426 --> 00:05:59,750
They're coming,
and they'll be coming

118
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:02,080
with everything they've got,
and the only thing

119
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:04,793
that's going to stop them is
getting these weapons ready

120
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:05,820
to deploy.

121
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,293
Yes, sir, I'll do my best.

122
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,861
I know you will.

123
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:14,333
(sighs)

124
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:16,702
(whistles)

125
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:17,803
Okay, let's go!

126
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:33,280
(men grunting)

127
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:35,881
What does the FBI know?

128
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,393
I'm not going to ask you again.

129
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:40,423
(coughing)

130
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:46,263
Okay.

131
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:51,700
You're a good man, Tony.

132
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,842
I know your profile.

133
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,713
You've had some hard breaks.

134
00:06:56,775 --> 00:07:00,580
I don't want to see you hurt,

135
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,490
so you just tell me
what the FBI knows

136
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:05,953
about what we're doing here,

137
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,350
and I can't say you'll
walk away smiling--

138
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,490
that would be unrealistic--

139
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,893
but you'll be alive.

140
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,630
You hear me?

141
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:30,142
But I don't know anything,
Mr. Hodges.

142
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:44,790
I'm giving you a way out, Tony.

143
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,890
Sir,

144
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:48,625
may I speak to
you for a moment?

145
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,367
Not now, Greg.

146
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,693
Please, sir,

147
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,160
just for a moment.

148
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,673
What is it?

149
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,832
This was supposed to
be a covert operation.

150
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:08,833
That is not the case

151
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:09,750
anymore.

152
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:11,750
The government knows that
we have these weapons,

153
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:14,432
and they're not just going
to sit on that information.

154
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:17,993
What are you suggesting, Greg?

155
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:21,261
Maybe we should
destroy the evidence

156
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,123
while we still have some time.

157
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,092
I can't believe

158
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:28,801
that I'm hearing this from you.

159
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,071
I'm just trying to help, sir.

160
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:32,332
I care about this company
as much as you do.

161
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:34,902
Oh, I doubt that.

162
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,512
We've invested a lot
of blood and treasure

163
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:40,323
to get these weapons,
and I'm not going to give them up.

164
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:44,212
Think about what
you're risking, sir--

165
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:47,280
everything, everything
you've built.

166
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,022
You say you're trying to help.

167
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,723
You know what I think?

168
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,491
I think you're worried
about your own ass.

169
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,720
Get him out of here and
do what you have to do.

170
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:58,632
Think about what I said,
young man.

171
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,802
You're a little nervous, Greg.

172
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:01,033
Well, I've got a news flash:

173
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,662
we're all nervous.

174
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,471
Keep your doubts to yourself.

175
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,971
I'm not going to
tell you again.

176
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:12,483
We're going to need to take
more blood and saliva samples,

177
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,880
and I'd like to collect
a spinal fluid specimen.

178
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:16,051
Until we know what
we're dealing with,

179
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:17,551
we need to keep you
under quarantine.

180
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:18,892
How long is it gonna
be till you know

181
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:19,990
whether or not I've
been infected?

182
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,523
We should have the
preliminary results

183
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:22,821
in the next 15 minutes.

184
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,022
Okay. Dr. Macer,

185
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,853
we've detected

186
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:27,532
trace amounts of an
airborne pathogen.

187
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,160
It's concentrated
near the truck.

188
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,733
We're also picking it up in
the surrounding environments

189
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,033
at much lower concentrations.

190
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:33,160
Can you identify it?

191
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:34,733
No, but we're
analyzing a sample now.

192
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,540
These levels shouldn't
present any danger

193
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,740
to the nearby population,

194
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,510
but I still want
atmospheric monitors set up.

195
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:42,570
It's a good thing you sealed
off the canister, Mr. Bauer.

196
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,911
You saved a lot of lives.

197
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:47,011
You're going to have to
transport me back to FBI.

198
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,353
I'm still material evidence in
an ongoing terrorist threat.

199
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,352
Those were our orders.

200
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:51,450
We can run our
tests from there.

201
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:53,482
Okay.

202
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,260
Bob Justman's been
associate counsel

203
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:01,571
for the past three years.

204
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:03,932
He and Ethan worked
very closely together.

205
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:07,033
He is certainly qualified
to be chief of staff.

206
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,733
But...

207
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,201
After what's happened today,

208
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,762
I think you should be looking
outside your administration.

209
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,841
An insider has a leg up.

210
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,841
Chief of staff has a
steep learning curve.

211
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,201
I think you're underestimating

212
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:23,950
the value of a
fresh perspective.

213
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:26,552
You have someone in mind.

214
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,683
I do.

215
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:29,893
Rick Berman.

216
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:35,972
Would Rick even consider
leaving the private sector?

217
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:37,261
Well, he's made his fortune.

218
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:39,270
I think he'd jump at the
chance to serve his country.

219
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:40,600
Let's sit down with him.

220
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:42,203
Great.

221
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,562
But keep Bob on the list.

222
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,170
I still have a good
feeling about him.

223
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,871
I'll start to set up
meetings tomorrow.

224
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:53,643
Livy, it could take weeks to
find Ethan's replacement.

225
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:56,483
In the meantime,

226
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:59,432
I'm going to need a
provisional chief of staff.

227
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,251
I'd like that to be you.

228
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,481
Um... (intercom beeps)

229
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:06,330
(over intercom):
Madam President?

230
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,042
Yes?

231
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,863
Tim Woods is here to see you.
Just give me a minute,

232
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,331
please, and then send him in.

233
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:15,201
Livy, I need
someone I can trust.

234
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,202
Especially after everything
that's happened today.

235
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,940
You're not going to say "no"
to your mother, are you?

236
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,540
Of course not.

237
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,540
Good.

238
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:29,683
(door opens)

239
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,953
Madam President,
I have Larry Moss

240
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,623
at FBI calling for you.

241
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:34,751
What's this about?

242
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:36,223
I don't know the specifics,

243
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,842
but he says it involves an
imminent homeland threat.

244
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:40,761
Put him through.

245
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:43,460
It's all right, Tim.

246
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,592
I've made Olivia
Acting Chief of Staff.

247
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,471
Agent Moss,
you're on with the president.

248
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,100
Madam President,
we have a situation developing.

249
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:55,540
First of all,
you need to know that Jack Bauer

250
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:58,272
did not kill Ryan Burnett
nor Senator Blaine Mayer.

251
00:11:58,348 --> 00:11:59,510
He was framed for
their murders.

252
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:00,610
I knew it.

253
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,712
Who framed him?
Our operational theory

254
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,910
is that he was set
up by Starkwood.

255
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,481
I don't understand.
Why would Starkwood frame Jack?

256
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:10,092
To cover up the fact that
they helped Juma stage

257
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,991
the terrorist attacks today.

258
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:12,993
What?

259
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,293
Ma'am, we have evidence

260
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,961
that Starkwood provided Juma

261
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:17,801
with technological
support and intelligence.

262
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:20,130
And in return,
Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala

263
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,330
as a base to operate
without having

264
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,571
to worry about any oversight.

265
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,230
A base for what?

266
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:27,570
To manufacture weapons
of mass destruction.

267
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,841
Specifically,
biological weapons.

268
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,821
What kind of bioweapons
are you talking about?

269
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,390
We're not sure, but it could be

270
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:47,421
some kind of
neurological pathogen.

271
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:49,723
CDC has obtained a sample
and they're analyzing it now.

272
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,873
Agent Moss,
you said there was an imminent threat.

273
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,712
Yes, a large shipment
of bioweapons

274
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,270
was delivered to Starkwood.

275
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:57,010
We believe they're in
possession of them now.

276
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,870
Are you saying these
weapons are on U.S. soil?

277
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,370
We suspect they're
at the Starkwood

278
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:01,602
headquarters in Virginia.

279
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:03,212
OLIVIA: You're not
suggesting that Starkwood

280
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:06,010
intends to use those weapons
to attack this country?

281
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,882
We don't know, but,
given their actions today,

282
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,951
we need to move on
Starkwood immediately.

283
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:18,122
Madam President?

284
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,623
Assemble the Cabinet
and the Joint Chiefs.

285
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,461
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:45,711
<i> Jack was right
about Starkwood.</i>

287
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:48,851
You found evidence that
they've been supporting Juma.

288
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,183
Yeah.

289
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:52,151
Did you find out why?

290
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:53,991
I mean, what could Starkwood
possibly get from Juma?

291
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,462
The infrastructure to develop
and test biological weapons.

292
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,091
We think they're
holding them somewhere

293
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:59,820
on the Starkwood compound.

294
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,332
Okay, where's Jack?

295
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:05,362
He's on his way over here.

296
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:09,032
What, Larry?

297
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:14,643
He managed to secure the weapons,
but then, uh,

298
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,741
Starkwood got them back.

299
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:19,812
And when that happened, um...

300
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:24,920
Jack was exposed.

301
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,091
He may have been infected.

302
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,850
He's being placed
under quarantine.

303
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,363
Listen, he's on his way here
and we need to find out

304
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,232
everything that he learned
about these weapons.

305
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:34,762
And I think you should be
the one who debriefs him.

306
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:41,100
And I owe you an apology.

307
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,030
I was wrong not to trust you,

308
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:47,512
and I-I let my prejudice
about Bauer get in the way.

309
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:50,441
But...

310
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,313
Renee, you should've
kept me in the loop.

311
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,720
You should've trusted me.

312
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,663
I know.

313
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,060
I should have.

314
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:15,630
When are we moving
on Starkwood?

315
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,341
(Olivia speaking quietly)

316
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,343
Aaron?

317
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:22,041
I'll check in with
you guys later, okay?

318
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:24,082
Thank you.

319
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,852
May I speak with
you for a moment?

320
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,222
Of course. I heard you finished

321
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,020
your debrief and were
on your way out.

322
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:32,323
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:34,490
Well, I need you to stay.

324
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:35,851
Ma'am?

325
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:38,690
I've been appointed
Acting Chief of Staff.

326
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:40,931
Secret Service is going
to assign an agent

327
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:43,162
to handle my security detail.

328
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:44,560
I'd like that to be you.

329
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,430
Well, I'm truly
flattered, ma'am,

330
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,372
but as you know, I'm retired.

331
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:53,172
I can have you reinstated.

332
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,541
There are plenty of fine agents

333
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:57,281
on the roster.
But I don't want them.

334
00:15:57,318 --> 00:15:58,681
I want you.

335
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,682
I can't go into
the details now,

336
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:05,181
but the threat to this
country isn't over.

337
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,223
We're in the middle
of a crisis,

338
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:09,242
and I need people
around me I can trust.

339
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,293
I trust you, Aaron.

340
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,862
I can't say that
about a lot of people.

341
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm running into a meeting
with the president.

342
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,833
I'll assume your
answer is "yes."

343
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:33,951
Gentlemen, ladies,
please take your seats.

344
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,682
Now, those of you who
haven't had a chance

345
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:41,223
to finish your
briefing packets,

346
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,152
please keep reading.

347
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:48,162
As we've all just learned,

348
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:50,331
this day is not over.

349
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:53,803
Our national security is
still being threatened,

350
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,303
and we are here to
consider our options.

351
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,801
Mr. Woods.

352
00:16:57,878 --> 00:16:59,502
Your briefing materials

353
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,610
include FBI intelligence
about a cache

354
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:04,412
of biological weapons on
Starkwood's main compound

355
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,811
in Northern Virginia.

356
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:08,552
This is a recent satellite
view of the compound.

357
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:11,421
Over three square miles,
259 structures--

358
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,490
the weapons could be hidden

359
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:13,750
anywhere on the facility.

360
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:15,022
ADMIRAL SMITH:
What kind of bioweapons

361
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,123
are we talking about?

362
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,801
This is Ben Landry,
he's director of CDC.

363
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,601
He's here to answer any
questions you may have

364
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:22,803
in regards to the
pathogen. Ben.

365
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:25,330
I've just received
a preliminary report

366
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:26,703
from our agents in the field.

367
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:29,371
They've identified the
pathogen as a prion variant

368
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:31,502
indigenous to the East Congo.

369
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,073
It's a form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

370
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:36,051
It attacks the brain
and the nervous system,

371
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,281
causes dementia,
physical deterioration,

372
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:39,940
ultimately death.

373
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,951
Standard CJD kills
within several months,

374
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:44,250
but this strain
kills more quickly.

375
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:45,550
How long?

376
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,920
A day, maybe two.

377
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:48,522
There's no treatment
for this disease.

378
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:49,953
There's no cure. If dispersed

379
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,120
over a populated area,

380
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:52,633
the results would
be catastrophic.

381
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:54,892
But it goes without saying

382
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,533
we cannot allow a
private military force,

383
00:17:57,606 --> 00:18:00,630
these killers,
to possess weapons of mass destruction.

384
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,531
We need to find these weapons,

385
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,043
and arrest those
bastards in Starkwood

386
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:07,342
who are responsible
for bringing them here.

387
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:08,810
(General Vincent clears throat)

388
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,070
Madam President.

389
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:15,451
Given the size of the compound,
it would take

390
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,711
a considerable force to
locate these weapons.

391
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,581
Not to mention the fact
that there are 1,500

392
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:23,291
highly-trained mercenaries
on that base.

393
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,491
God forbid they
decide to resist.

394
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:28,460
We could have a small
war in our own backyard.

395
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,602
I share those concerns,
Madam President.

396
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:33,732
We also have to consider
the possibility

397
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:36,011
that Starkwood might use
these biological weapons

398
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:37,340
against our own forces.

399
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:38,972
What about an air strike?

400
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:43,350
A facility that large would
require multiple bombing runs.

401
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,080
We'd be looking at
massive casualties

402
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,481
on the Starkwood base,

403
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,451
with no guarantee of
destroying the bioweapons.

404
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:49,480
For all we know,

405
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:50,550
they've been buried underground

406
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,853
or in fortified facilities.

407
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:54,133
There's also a risk that
hitting these weapons

408
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,763
with insufficient force
could release the bio-agent

409
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:56,963
into the atmosphere.

410
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:58,962
DAVENPORT: We can't just
ignore the law here.

411
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:01,902
All these scenarios
would be in violation

412
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,692
of the Posse Comitatus Act.

413
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,532
I mean,
we can't deploy military personnel

414
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,701
in a law enforcement capacity.

415
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:12,100
Not without
congressional approval.

416
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:13,301
What I'm hearing

417
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:16,980
is that there are
no good options.

418
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:19,142
I don't accept that.

419
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,281
Until we find

420
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:23,153
a way to contain this threat,

421
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:26,381
we are risking another
attack on this country.

422
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:29,453
And that is an option
I won't consider.

423
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:35,782
Mr. Hodges wants to know

424
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:38,263
if you've given any
thought to his offer.

425
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:44,870
Why this loyalty to a government
that screwed you over?

426
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,670
I don't get it.

427
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:48,972
Just tell us

428
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:51,280
what the FBI knows
and you can walk.

429
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,423
For the record,

430
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,451
I bet Mr.
Hodges a pair of Redskins tickets

431
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,950
you wouldn't talk.

432
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:04,892
(chamber clicks)

433
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,463
Looks like I'm
going to be sitting

434
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,893
on the 50 yard line.

435
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:11,600
(silenced gunshots)

436
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,071
Hey.

437
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:18,842
Hey, what the hell's going on?

438
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:23,340
I need your help.

439
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,111
My help?

440
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:27,253
We need to stop this.
It's gone too far.

441
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:30,452
Look, I'm not going anywhere

442
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:32,122
until you tell me why
you're doing this.

443
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:34,150
(handcuffs unlocking)

444
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,503
I'm not spending
the rest of my life

445
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,932
in prison because Jonas
Hodges has lost his mind.

446
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:44,600
You know where the weapons are?

447
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,932
Yes.

448
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:47,773
Then you better
tell me right now.

449
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:49,600
I want immunity.

450
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,871
Look, I can't
promise you anything.

451
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:54,141
We can call the FBI
and negotiate a deal,

452
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,112
immunity in exchange
for your help

453
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,732
in recovering the weapons,
that's the best I can do.

454
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:02,650
I can set up a secure
landline in my office.

455
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:04,051
Good, let's go.

456
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:08,592
(sirens blaring)

457
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,390
We're pulling up to FBI.

458
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:18,501
We have to put you
in an isolation suit

459
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,660
to transfer you to
the quarantine area.

460
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,332
I understand.

461
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:23,673
How are you feeling?

462
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:27,141
No different.

463
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,513
We have the results of Mr.
Bauer's blood work.

464
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,881
Thank you.

465
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,321
Open it.

466
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:59,102
(sighs)

467
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:00,070
Thank you.

468
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:19,283
Excuse me.

469
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:20,550
Larry wanted me to tell you,

470
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,180
that CDC arrived
with Jack Bauer.

471
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:23,953
I'll meet them down in quarantine.
He's not in quarantine.

472
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:26,622
I don't understand.

473
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:27,950
That's all I know.

474
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:30,321
They just cleared security.
He's on his way up.

475
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:35,463
(elevator bell dings,
doors opening)

476
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:41,403
Jack, are you okay?

477
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:43,402
My blood work came
back positive.

478
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:44,742
I'm infected.

479
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:47,042
MAN: Mr. Bauer,
there's a room for you to change in.

480
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,043
Thank you.

481
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:51,643
It's fine.

482
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:56,281
But he's not in quarantine.

483
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:58,452
We've learned the
disease isn't contagious.

484
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,390
It was engineered that
way to prevent blowback

485
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:01,891
on the people
deploying it. Okay,

486
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:02,991
but there has to be something

487
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,821
that you can do to help him.

488
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:06,492
There's no cure.

489
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:07,662
But he's patient zero.

490
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:08,900
Whatever we learn
from the pathogen

491
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:10,472
will come from the tests
we still need to run.

492
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:12,332
(phone rings)

493
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:15,031
Excuse me.

494
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:18,202
This is Macer.

495
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:20,511
He's stable for the moment.

496
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:26,141
(knocking on door) Yeah?

497
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:31,982
Jack, um...

498
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:34,452
I don't know what to say.

499
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:37,171
Then tell me that Agent Moss
followed up on Starkwood.

500
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,892
Sorry.

501
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:44,902
Larry debriefed the White House

502
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,501
and we're waiting
on the president

503
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:48,041
to decide on a
course of action.

504
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,471
Good.

505
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:50,570
Any word on Tony?

506
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,943
Sorry, we don't
know anything yet.

507
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,982
I need to debrief you

508
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,011
on the canisters that you saw.

509
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:02,013
You okay with that?

510
00:24:02,086 --> 00:24:03,753
Yeah.

511
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,921
I read the statement

512
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:11,421
from the Port Authority cop.

513
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,562
He said that you
risked the mission

514
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:15,631
to save his life.

515
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:19,930
You did the right thing.

516
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,202
Thanks.

517
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,172
??

518
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:01,071
(beeps) (phone ringing)

519
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:07,583
Uh, it's the lab.

520
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:10,380
It's probably Hodges.

521
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:11,881
We should talk to him.

522
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:13,951
Put it on speaker.

523
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:18,091
Seaton.

524
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:19,790
Where the hell have you been?

525
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:20,823
I've been trying

526
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:21,833
to reach you.

527
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,163
I was, uh, checking on Almeida.

528
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,763
Did Stokes get him to talk?

529
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,041
He's still working
on that, sir.

530
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:30,002
I told him to put Almeida down

531
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:31,371
if he didn't start talking.

532
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,871
I think we should give him
a few more minutes, sir.

533
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:36,270
We're busting our asses to
get these weapons ready

534
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:38,050
before the government
makes their move,

535
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:40,981
I want all hands on deck.

536
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:42,351
We'll be there soon, sir.

537
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,323
See that you are, Greg.

538
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,722
Call FBI.

539
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,051
I need to set up
the secure landline.

540
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:51,690
Make sure nobody's listening.

541
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:53,693
All right, well, do it.

542
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:55,022
(typing)

543
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:57,731
I never thought Jonas
would take it this far.

544
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,900
I mean, the man's a patriot.

545
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:02,201
He founded Starkwood to protect

546
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:03,530
this country.

547
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:05,541
Yeah, well,
why is he attacking it?

548
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:06,931
It's complicated.

549
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:10,710
I don't understand it myself.

550
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:13,112
I should've done
more to stop this.

551
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:15,561
I should've

552
00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:17,080
called FBI months ago.

553
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:19,550
Well, you're doing
the right thing now.

554
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,090
I've pulled together everything
we have on Starkwood.

555
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,393
Structural specs, aerial maps,

556
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,963
topography, company roster,

557
00:26:26,027 --> 00:26:27,160
the whole works. All right.

558
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,330
Upload it onto the
interagency servers.

559
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:31,460
Let's get everybody
on the same page.

560
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:34,531
That's good work, Janis.

561
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:35,873
Renee...

562
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:40,300
I heard about Jack.

563
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,841
I'm sorry.

564
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:43,912
I'm still debriefing
him but I brought a full

565
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:45,481
description of the canisters.

566
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:47,351
All right.

567
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:49,592
All right,
get this out to the field agents.

568
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,353
How's he doing?

569
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:54,183
Hard to tell.

570
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:58,020
Larry, so many people
have died today.

571
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,462
We cannot let their deaths be

572
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,631
for nothing. We won't.

573
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:02,892
Larry. I've got Tony Almeida

574
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:04,733
on the phone. Almeida?

575
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,641
He says he's calling
from inside Starkwood.

576
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,142
Put him through.

577
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,902
Go ahead, Tony.

578
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:12,000
Who am I talking to?

579
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,872
It's Larry Moss.
What's going on?

580
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:15,343
I'm on the Starkwood compound.

581
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:17,640
I was being held by a
man named Jonas Hodges,

582
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,593
but I was released by
one of his executives.

583
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:21,711
A man named Greg Seaton.

584
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:23,212
Now he wants to cut a deal.

585
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:24,552
He wants immunity.

586
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,172
What's he offering in return?

587
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,343
He knows where the
weapons are being held.

588
00:27:29,957 --> 00:27:32,361
All right, Tony,
I got to run this by the president.

589
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:33,992
Wait, Larry.

590
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,711
Do you know what
happened to Jack?

591
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:38,263
He's here.

592
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:40,261
He's in medical.

593
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:41,830
Was he hit? No.

594
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:43,730
One of the canisters
was breached.

595
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:45,801
He's been infected.

596
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:49,213
Tony, I got to call the White House.
Stand by.

597
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:50,652
Janis, set up a secure
connection in the conference

598
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:52,551
room with Almeida and the
White House for this signature.

599
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,432
And get me the
president on the phone.

600
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:18,913
<i>- ?OH OH OH... ?
- MORE PEOPLE GO FUNKY
OLIVIA:
What is this?</i>

601
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,871
TAYLOR: Footage
recovered from Sangala.

602
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:22,670
It was smuggled
out of the remains

603
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:26,641
of a biological weapons
lab about 45 minutes ago.

604
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:30,312
It's a confirmation that
Juma was experimenting

605
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:33,052
with biological weapons

606
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:35,080
on the local population.

607
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:38,022
These poor people
were suffering

608
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:41,493
from the effects of the
weaponized prion variant.

609
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:44,663
And that's what we
allowed Starkwood

610
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:46,700
to bring into this country.

611
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,731
We didn't allow this.

612
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:51,571
Starkwood is a monster
we created, Olivia.

613
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,070
We have been feeding
it for years.

614
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:56,010
We gave them
military contracts.

615
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:58,013
We relied on their
paid mercenaries

616
00:28:58,087 --> 00:28:59,510
instead of our own soldiers,

617
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:02,110
outsourced intelligence
gathering operations.

618
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,950
My God, we even passed a law

619
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,653
so that they could
build a military base

620
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:07,583
13 miles from the
nation's capitol.

621
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:09,593
You fought against all that.

622
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:11,430
You've been trying to
limit Starkwood's power

623
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:12,852
ever since you took office.

624
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,590
I didn't do enough...

625
00:29:15,665 --> 00:29:17,633
fast enough.

626
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:20,900
And now it may be too late.

627
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,973
AIDE (over intercom):
Madam President, Tim Woods

628
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:24,641
and Admiral Smith
are here to see you.

629
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:26,671
Send them in.

630
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:31,683
Madam President,
Larry Moss at FBI is calling in.

631
00:29:31,715 --> 00:29:32,712
He says it's urgent.

632
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:34,143
Put him through.

633
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:36,251
Agent Moss, the president's here.
Go ahead.

634
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:37,720
Madam President,
we've been contacted

635
00:29:37,757 --> 00:29:39,723
by someone inside Starkwood.

636
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:41,721
Ma'am, it's Tony Almeida.

637
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:43,390
Almeida?

638
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,531
He's been working with Jack
Bauer to recover these weapons.

639
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,522
He was taken captive
but then released

640
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,131
by someone on the inside.

641
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:50,832
His name is Greg Seaton.

642
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:53,130
He's part of Jonas
Hodges' inner circle.

643
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:54,843
Ma'am, he says he's
willing to tell us

644
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,173
where the weapons are in
exchange for immunity.

645
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:59,171
Now, I've already
started mobilizing

646
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:00,741
for a targeted raid.

647
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:02,113
We can catch 'em by surprise

648
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:03,142
and lock down these weapons.

649
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,510
But I'm going to
need you to sign

650
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:05,780
an immunity agreement
for this man.

651
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:06,811
How confident

652
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:08,313
are you of Seaton's intel?

653
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:09,930
We believe it's genuine, ma'am.

654
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:11,780
Madam President,

655
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,353
we may not get a chance
like this again.

656
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:15,223
Admiral Smith?

657
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:16,553
I concur,

658
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,390
but I would suggest
we supplement the FBI

659
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:19,723
with a SEAL squad.

660
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:21,192
They're ready to
move on my order.

661
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:22,792
The attorney general
will raise hell

662
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:24,770
about us involving the
military in this operation.

663
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:26,733
We'll deal with him later.

664
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,233
Agent Moss, you have

665
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:31,230
my direct authorization
to move on Starkwood.

666
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:33,240
How soon can you be ready?

667
00:30:33,308 --> 00:30:35,110
We've already drafted
an executive pardon,

668
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:36,873
and set it up via WebEx.

669
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:39,883
You'll be able to give a secure
digital signature and we're good to go.

670
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,713
We have the document set up
at your assistant's computer.

671
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:53,363
Agent Moss,

672
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:54,731
the president is
prepared to sign.

673
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:56,090
Go ahead, ma'am.

674
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,630
All right, it's done.

675
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:05,072
Tony, did you get
the signature?

676
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,073
Yeah, we're good.

677
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:08,173
When can you be at Starkwood?

678
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:10,012
We can be there in ten minutes.

679
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,812
Agent Moss, thank you.

680
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:13,111
And good luck.

681
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:14,141
Thank you, ma'am.

682
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:16,680
Let's go.

683
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:18,792
Madam President,
we may have just caught a lucky break.

684
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:20,420
Until this plays out,

685
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:23,352
I want everyone to keep
looking for other options.

686
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:33,563
All right, Mr. Seaton.

687
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:35,563
Go ahead.

688
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:37,603
The weapons are in a warehouse

689
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:40,272
on the northeast quadrant
of the compound.

690
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:43,440
32, 44.23 north...

691
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:46,381
117, 10.42 west.

692
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,643
(beeps)

693
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,321
Mr. Seaton, it would help to
have someone on the ground

694
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:51,410
doing recon.

695
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:53,181
Can you get Tony
to that warehouse?

696
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:54,252
I think so.

697
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:55,861
See if you can get
ahold of a hand radio.

698
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:56,890
We'll be on 480 kilohertz.

699
00:31:56,926 --> 00:31:58,523
All right, we'll be there.

700
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:01,333
If we land here, we'll be within
50 yards of the warehouse.

701
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,362
Yeah, support teams here

702
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:03,360
and here. Shore us up.

703
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:05,331
Coordinate with the navy.

704
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,100
Get moving.
I'll meet you upstairs.

705
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:08,310
Let's move!

706
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:12,910
You're mobilizing.
What's going on?

707
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:14,903
We got a call from Tony.

708
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,010
He's working with an
informant inside Starkwood.

709
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:18,412
We got a location
on the weapon,

710
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:19,581
we're getting ready to stage

711
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:21,360
a raid on the compound.
I want to go.

712
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:23,782
I can understand why,
but I'm sorry.

713
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:25,353
I can't allow it.
Larry, I can help you with this.

714
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:26,523
I'm the only one who's
seen the canisters,

715
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,401
I know exactly what
we're looking for.

716
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:29,421
I read your debrief.

717
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,721
You gave us all the
details we need.

718
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:34,583
Larry, please,
I've earned this.

719
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:37,960
Jack, I know

720
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:39,802
what you've done today,

721
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:41,160
the sacrifice you've made.

722
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,573
Uh, under any
other circumstances,

723
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:46,043
I'd want you out there with us,
but you're sick,

724
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,302
and we have no idea

725
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:49,110
when you're going to
start showing symptoms.

726
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:50,742
I cannot risk that happening

727
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:52,040
out in the field.

728
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:54,080
I need my best men
for this operation.

729
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:58,183
I hope you can understand that.

730
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:04,092
You're right.

731
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:07,960
You're right.

732
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,493
Yeah.

733
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:15,502
I always knew eventually
we'd agree on something.

734
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:20,142
I'm so sorry, Jack.

735
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:59,041
Mr. Seaton? Murphy, I need

736
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:00,880
to check the personnel that...

737
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:32,412
That's it.

738
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:33,360
(panting)

739
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:36,211
The weapons are inside there.

740
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:38,321
ALMEIDA: How many men inside?

741
00:34:38,385 --> 00:34:41,221
Hodges, munitions
team, security.

742
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,593
I'm guessing a dozen or more.

743
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,091
(sighs)

744
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,632
Wolves are at the door, Tommy.

745
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:51,631
How much longer?

746
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,771
We're still an hour away
from being armed, sir.

747
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:56,131
We just intercepted a
government transmission.

748
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:58,440
FBI is on the way.

749
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:01,840
Sir, we haven't even run
the sequence checks yet.

750
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:03,573
Let's do it!

751
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:06,081
(under his breath):
Oh, damn it.

752
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:08,451
(Hodges sighs)

753
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,953
What's our ETA?

754
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:15,121
Two minutes, sir.

755
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:16,822
Tony, it's Larry Moss.

756
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:18,222
Are you in position?

757
00:35:18,298 --> 00:35:19,523
ALMEIDA: Affirmative.

758
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:21,993
We're about 50 yards
north of the warehouse.

759
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:23,833
MOSS: What can you tell me?

760
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:26,001
Got two entrances,
north and south.

761
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:27,802
Heavy steel doors.

762
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,202
Two guards armed with
automatic weapons.

763
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:32,573
Seaton says there's probably
about a dozen inside.

764
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,710
We have to assume they're armed,
as well.

765
00:35:34,777 --> 00:35:36,220
All right. We're almost there.

766
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:38,151
I'm gonna need your eyes
on the ground in case

767
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:39,331
there's any resistance.

768
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:40,511
Copy that.

769
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:41,812
Aerial One to home base.

770
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:43,883
Target has been confirmed.
We are go

771
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:46,650
for Tac plan Alpha.
Copy that, Aerial One.

772
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:49,223
All feeds are live.
We're monitoring your approach.

773
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:55,333
Sir, we're being signaled
by Starkwood's air tower.

774
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:56,691
Let me talk to them.

775
00:35:58,606 --> 00:35:59,330
You're on.

776
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:00,560
This is Special Agent

777
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:02,031
Larry Moss from FBI.

778
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:03,900
We have an executive order

779
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,373
from the president
of the United States

780
00:36:05,406 --> 00:36:07,170
to search one of
your buildings.

781
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,472
FBI? I'll need to
get authorization

782
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:10,641
from my superior.

783
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:11,810
We have sent you

784
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:13,680
a digital copy of
the executive order.

785
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:15,020
Check your wireless frequency.

786
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:16,152
That is all

787
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:18,053
the authorization
you will need.

788
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,770
Make no attempt to interfere,
or you will be arrested.

789
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:22,123
Do you understand?

790
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,262
Do you understand?

791
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:26,621
Understood, FBI.

792
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:29,062
Take us in.

793
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:32,303
Aerial One to home base.

794
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:33,530
We're good to go.

795
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,701
Copy that, Aerial One.

796
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,002
Looks like you have
got a clean approach.

797
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:37,203
No hostiles in sight.

798
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:04,303
(helicopter blades whirring)

799
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,192
??

800
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:43,501
MOSS: You all right?

801
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:44,873
We have a medic.

802
00:37:44,945 --> 00:37:46,273
I'm fine.

803
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:49,412
Seaton, I need you
to stay behind us.

804
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,480
Let's go.

805
00:38:13,537 --> 00:38:14,671
Stand down!

806
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:17,502
You were told to stand down!

807
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:20,603
Lower your weapons and
get on the ground now!

808
00:38:21,715 --> 00:38:23,463
Lock them down!

809
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,050
It's locked, sir.

810
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:34,392
Blow it.

811
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,193
Blasting!

812
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:44,330
Three. Two. One!

813
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:48,071
Go. Go!

814
00:39:03,628 --> 00:39:04,751
Where are the weapons?

815
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:06,571
I don't know.

816
00:39:06,698 --> 00:39:08,321
What do you mean,
you don't know?

817
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:09,962
Almeida was
threatening to kill me.

818
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:11,822
I told him what he
wanted to hear.

819
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:13,761
You lying son of a bitch!
You came to me!

820
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:15,593
Now, where are the weapons?!

821
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:18,633
Where are the damn weapons?!
Tell him to take his hands off of me.

822
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,501
Tony? Tony!
I need you to stand down now!

823
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:23,221
You're not getting
away with this.

824
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:24,502
Secure him!

825
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:28,173
He's lying, Larry.

826
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:29,581
(panting)

827
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:31,912
He played me.

828
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,681
Yeah, I know.
It looks that way.

829
00:39:46,197 --> 00:39:48,831
Well, what do you know?

830
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:51,130
Little old Seaton
bought us some time.

831
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:55,202
They're on the other
side of the compound.

832
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:58,440
We just have to
keep them there.

833
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:26,862
There's nothing here, sir.

834
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,900
(sighs)

835
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,472
Renee, the warehouse is empty.

836
00:40:31,477 --> 00:40:32,973
Tony's informant

837
00:40:33,046 --> 00:40:34,111
sent us to the wrong location.

838
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:36,073
This whole thing
was a diversion.

839
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:38,212
They couldn't have gotten
them out that fast.

840
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:39,750
The weapons are
there somewhere.

841
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,313
Larry, the weapons have to be

842
00:40:41,386 --> 00:40:42,480
inside of Starkwood.

843
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:43,880
Tell them to keep looking.

844
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:45,983
Stand by.

845
00:40:48,076 --> 00:40:50,321
All right,
everyone outside now.

846
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:08,041
All right, listen up.

847
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:09,642
We're going to do
a point-by-point

848
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,943
search of this entire compound.

849
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:13,880
Good.

850
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:15,781
MOSS: I want four
teams sweeping

851
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,852
every structure
on this property.

852
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:21,751
(tires squealing,
engines revving)

853
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:25,190
(tires squealing)

854
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,222
Jack.

855
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:28,432
(engines revving)

856
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:29,491
MOSS: Hold your fire!

857
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:32,160
Hold your fire.

858
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:35,100
(tires squeak)

859
00:41:36,136 --> 00:41:37,500
Hold your fire.

860
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,142
Stay in position.

861
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,342
(mumbling softly)

862
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,983
Tell Larry to have
his men stand down.

863
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:45,482
Are you kidding me?
They just drew on federal forces.

864
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:46,783
If you don't want to lose your men,
you'll get them

865
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:47,963
to stand down now. Now!

866
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:49,983
(tires squeal)

867
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:52,051
MOSS: Hold your fire!

868
00:41:58,068 --> 00:41:59,120
That's far enough.

869
00:42:04,308 --> 00:42:07,002
We cooperated with your demand

870
00:42:07,078 --> 00:42:08,932
to search this building.

871
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:10,140
Now, we're asking you to leave.

872
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:11,313
MOSS: There are biological

873
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:12,473
weapons on this facility.

874
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:14,141
We're not going
anywhere without them.

875
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:15,731
Now, tell your
men to stand down.

876
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,473
Those charges are absurd,

877
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:19,982
and we're not going to
let you keep searching.

878
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:21,610
You're on private property,

879
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:23,993
and we're prepared to
defend it if necessary.

880
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:26,450
You are threatening
federal agents.

881
00:42:26,526 --> 00:42:28,450
Stand down! Now!

882
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:29,763
We're protecting our rights

883
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,330
against a hostile
government that's using

884
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:34,021
false charges to
try to shut us down.

885
00:42:34,097 --> 00:42:35,931
Now, we don't want
any bloodshed.

886
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:41,800
But if you try to
advance any farther,

887
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:44,343
you will be fired upon.
