3
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:16,288
Hassan's security forces
in the Islamic Republic

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,258
are sweeping through the capital,
arresting opposition leaders.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,667
And if he continues,
it may delegitimize the peace accord.

6
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:27,013
I can't vouch for you as a reformer,
Mr. President,

7
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:29,695
if you renege
on your human rights obligations.

8
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:31,937
My brother tried to kill me,

9
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:35,159
helped by elements
within my own government.

10
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:39,244
Apparently, killing President Hassan
was only part of his brother's plan.

11
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,958
CTU now believes he's also trying
to acquire weapons-grade uranium.

12
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,284
When can I take possession
of the rods?

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,047
As soon as we have the money.

14
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,756
- I found a doctor who can treat him.
- No doctors.

15
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,422
The authorities know
about the nuclear material.

16
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:55,805
Putting Oleg in a clinic
would lead them right to us.

17
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:58,641
- Dr. Levine.
- How did you get in here?

18
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:00,943
- My brother is sick.
- I call you an ambulance.

19
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:03,118
No. No one can know about this.

20
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,921
What do you want from me?

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,476
You're a data analyst for CTU.

22
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,645
You got access
to all sorts of good stuff.

23
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,409
- Yeah, but not unrestricted access.
- Payout's got to be at least 6 figures.

24
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:19,578
You were undercover for nearly two years
with the Russian Mob.

25
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:21,587
You're asking me to go back in?

26
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,157
Laitanan was obsessed with her.
It turned violent.

27
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:28,087
- Did he rape her?
- He tried a couple of times.

28
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:31,664
- Can we talk about this deal now?
- I wish it were that simple.

29
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,131
<i>- Tie her up.
- What?</i>

30
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,970
You're making a mistake.
This is the chance of a lifetime.

31
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:37,513
<i>It's over.</i>

32
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,298
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

33
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:42,274
Renee, it's Jack.
I know you can hear me.

34
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,509
<i>I'm on my way now.</i>

35
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,478
You don't want to do this deal,

36
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,942
then kill me,

37
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,942
because this deal
is the only thing that I have.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Do it!

39
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:53,529
Pull the trigger!

40
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,783
I had to be sure.

41
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,560
Jack, are you there?
What's going on?

42
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:04,415
She's in.
They bought her cover.

43
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,217
<i>I've got a visual on you.</i>

44
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:35,227
<i>I'm going off comm for a minute.</i>

45
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,405
You all right?

46
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:47,415
Chloe,
I want you to monitor Renee's comm.

47
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,677
<i>- I need to speak to Hastings.</i>
- I'll put you through.

48
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,735
Go ahead.

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,211
<i>- We need to pull Renee Walker out now.</i>
- Based on what?

50
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,047
She's a danger to herself.

51
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:58,223
Laitanan threatened to execute her,
she said she was sick of living,

52
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,940
- and wanted to die, she meant it.
- She must've been playing him.

53
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:04,423
She doesn't care what happens to her,
that's what makes her dangerous.

54
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:07,481
She's like a bomb ready to go off.
We need to get her out of there.

55
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:10,228
I understand your concern,
but we can't roll up this operation

56
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:12,024
before we find those nuclear rods.

57
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,342
We can arrest Laitanan. If he knows how
to find the rods, I will make him talk.

58
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:18,527
If you're saying what I think you are,
we don't do that anymore.

59
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,320
Then you people do what you do well.

60
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,542
- Offer him immunity or something.
- This is the Russian Syndicate.

61
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,811
They're very secretive,
they protect their own.

62
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,213
It is highly unlikely

63
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:29,999
- that Laitanan would cooperate.
- You better find another way,

64
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:32,818
I am not gonna let Renee die
because CTU did their job badly.

65
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,178
<i>I will not let that happen.
Do you understand me?</i>

66
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:38,156
If you can think of something,
I will listen. But right now,

67
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,159
<i>Renee's the only hope we have
of neutralizing this threat.</i>

68
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,534
<i>And on my order, she stays in play.</i>

69
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:53,105
I'll find a way to get her out
when I go in as the buyer.

70
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,135
<i>I'll stay under in her place.</i>

71
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:58,229
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

72
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:00,613
As long as you can do it
without risking the mission.

73
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,451
- I give you my word.
<i>- Agent Ortiz will meet you</i>

74
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,674
<i>at the staging area with a TAC team.</i>

75
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,821
<i>He'll have everything you need
for your cover.</i>

76
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:11,575
Hold on. They're moving.
I need to get back on comm.

77
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,800
We'll go back to my shop,
and we will discuss this buyer of yours.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,322
Dana...
Start forwarding mission

79
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,541
status reports to the Nuclear
Emergency Team at Fort Hamilton.

80
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,383
I want them ready to go in
as soon as we find these nuclear rods.

81
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:51,667
I'm on it, sir.

82
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,927
It's me.
I've got something.

83
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,034
Damn, you're fast.
Okay, hold on.

84
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,840
Okay, go.
Let's hear it.

85
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,321
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

86
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,415
According to the manifest,

87
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,890
a local vice group
just impounded a stash of drug money.

88
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,849
It'll be held there
for the next 48 hours.

89
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:42,257
- How much?
- $120,000.

90
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:47,763
- All right, what's the plan?
<i>- You go in and take it.</i>

91
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:54,106
Break into a police station?
Are you out of your mind?

92
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,521
It's a warehouse.

93
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,198
Most of the security is automated.
I can manipulate it from here.

94
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:03,102
You walk in, you walk out with the cash.
I'll talk you through it.

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,730
<i>I need to access
their security codes,</i>

96
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,894
work up a keycard
to get you inside the warehouse.

97
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,910
- How long?
- Meet me outside CTU in 30 minutes.

98
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,146
Did you take care of your situation?

99
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:18,002
- Situation?
- The mystery you had to leave work for.

100
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,610
It's fine.

101
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:21,920
What do you need?

102
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,312
I'm getting five percent lag
in my Drone's ABS controls.

103
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,177
With everything going on,
I'm running hot.

104
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:29,795
Okay, I'll make sure
to free up some memory space

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,670
on the auxiliary servers.

106
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,309
Thanks.

107
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,005
You know,
if there's something bothering you,

108
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,970
you've always got
my shoulder to cry on.

109
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:40,456
Or any other body part.

110
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,474
I will keep that in mind.

111
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:46,215
For now, why don't you focus on running
aerial support for Walker and Bauer?

112
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:20,697
Lugo, take a break.

113
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,733
I want to talk to her alone.

114
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:36,669
All right, you have my attention.

115
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:39,652
Tell me about this buyer.

116
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,234
His name's Ernst Meier.

117
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,870
German arms dealer.

118
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,997
- Never heard of him.
- He does most of his business in Asia,

119
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,055
he just started branching out
into America.

120
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,804
- What's he looking to buy?
- Weapons-grade uranium.

121
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,309
- You're serious?
- Very.

122
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,577
Someone in the Russian Syndicate

123
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,963
smuggled nuclear fuel rods
out of the Ukraine.

124
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:04,760
They're planning on selling them
on the open market.

125
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,987
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

126
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:12,315
- I don't, Renee.
- But you can find out.

127
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,114
You're very well connected.

128
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,630
I have always admired...

129
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:19,123
your ambition,

130
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,252
but you're chasing the devil.

131
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,626
Dealing AK-47s...

132
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,050
no one really cares.

133
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,157
But nuclear material?

134
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,967
The profit is worth it.

135
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:33,777
You need money?

136
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,054
You can always come work for me.

137
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,102
I'm doing this so I don't ever have
to work for anyone.

138
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:43,061
Have a seat.

139
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,049
If I could find out,

140
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:48,819
what would it be worth?

141
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,008
30% of the deal.

142
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,627
I don't have to tell you,
that is more money

143
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:56,860
than you could possibly know
what to do with.

144
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,613
Meier says these rods
are going to be sold soon,

145
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,783
so if we want to make a counter bid,
it has to happen fast.

146
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,420
If you don't know anything, tell me,
so I can go somewhere else.

147
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:11,925
How well do you know him?
You trust him?

148
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,460
There's no one I trust more.
I've been with him for two years.

149
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:19,099
- What do you mean "with"?
- It's professional.

150
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:23,562
Can you help us or not?

151
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:31,045
I'll make a few calls,

152
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,870
see what I can find out.

153
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,807
I'm going to have
to meet this Meier.

154
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:39,323
And I need a good faith payment
up front.

155
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,119
- How much?
- Five million.

156
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:43,688
That's a lot of money.

157
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,986
I'm taking big risk
just making these calls.

158
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,792
5 million is nothing compared
to what your buyer will have to pay

159
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,517
for nuclear fuel rods.

160
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:53,714
Fine.

161
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,335
I'll ask him,
but I can't make any promises.

162
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,014
If he wants my help,
that's the price.

163
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:04,853
There's a garage
on the corner of 12th and Market Street.

164
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,712
Someone will meet him there,
on the roof.

165
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,848
Once the money is in our account,

166
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:13,111
they'll bring him back here,
we will talk.

167
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,223
I'll give him a call.

168
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,243
It's good to see you.

169
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:25,252
You're going to make me
start losing sleep again.

170
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,419
I'll let you know what Meier says.

171
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:31,805
I'll tell my men.

172
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,156
I'll give you privacy for your call.

173
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:10,025
- Were you listening?
- We're ready to wire the money.

174
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,955
- When can you be there?
- As soon as I finish prepping my cover.

175
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,739
I'm almost at the staging area.
30 minutes tops.

176
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:19,401
How you holding up?

177
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:22,254
It's hard to be in the same room
with this son of a bitch.

178
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:25,507
- I can handle it.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

179
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:43,092
Morphine will take effect
in just a few moments.

180
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,540
Don't worry, Oleg.
You're going to be fine.

181
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:53,818
It might help me if I knew exactly
what happened to your brother.

182
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,472
How did he get exposed
to weapons-grade uranium?

183
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,642
Don't worry about that.

184
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,427
Just make sure he lives.

185
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,450
It's him again, isn't it?

186
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,040
The second time he's called.

187
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,589
You should answer it.

188
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,239
Why aren't you picking up your phone?
I called you twice.

189
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,824
Must have been in the tunnel.

190
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:25,285
Ulana says you're not at the house.

191
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,336
- Where are you?
- Stuck in traffic.

192
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,040
- Tell her it's going to be a while.
- How's Oleg?

193
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:31,660
He's okay.
Sleeping.

194
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,119
Let me know
when you get to the house.

195
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:35,717
I will.

196
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:38,799
It was him?

197
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,080
Don't worry, okay?

198
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,478
By the time he finds out,

199
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,569
you'll already have been treated.

200
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,561
Then it won't matter.

201
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,026
It's just the test results.

202
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,040
You say or do anything
that I don't like,

203
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,072
and my men will kill
your wife and daughter.

204
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:09,399
Open the door.

205
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:14,459
- The blood work you ordered.
- Thank you.

206
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,889
I noticed there was no patient name.

207
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,668
You're right.
I forgot to put that down.

208
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,174
I'll take care of it later.

209
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:23,009
Is everything okay?

210
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:27,389
Fine.
I'm just working a little later

211
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,685
than I expected.

212
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:34,668
You did good.

213
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,440
What does it say?

214
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,538
Your brother has been
exposed to at least 400 rems.

215
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:44,823
The chemical toxicity
of the radiation is causing

216
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,009
- renal failure.
- I know it's serious.

217
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:48,618
Can you help him or not?

218
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,600
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

219
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:53,039
That requires a surgical team
in a fully equipment.

220
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:56,585
There has to be something
you can do right here,

221
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:57,932
right now.

222
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,795
Drugs could help him

223
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,340
to flush out the radiation
and stimulate white blood cell,

224
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,469
but that's a half measure.
I can't guarantee

225
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,837
he'll recover.

226
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,308
My brother is not going to die.

227
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:13,951
It's up to you, Doctor.

228
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:16,855
Now get to work.

229
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,327
Okay, got it.

230
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:32,078
That was CTU.
Your offshore account's in place.

231
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:35,389
They're forwarding instructions
to your PDA on how to wire the money.

232
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:36,514
Excuse me.

233
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:39,377
Hastings said,

234
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,963
as soon as we have confirmation
that Laitanan can get us

235
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,882
to the rods,
we're pulling Walker out.

236
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,683
That's right.

237
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,745
What's going on, Jack?

238
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,846
Hastings said she's unstable.

239
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:53,099
I don't have time to explain it.
Just follow my lead.

240
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,893
How do we do without breaking cover?

241
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,921
- I don't know yet.
- All right.

242
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:59,314
I got 2 teams
running coordinated drive-bus.

243
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,147
They'll be ready when she's clear.

244
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:03,485
They own this neighborhood
and have eyes everywhere.

245
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,655
- Your men could be spotted.
- I've done this before.

246
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,986
I ran an operation like it
in Fallujah.

247
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:10,277
And I'm in command.

248
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,469
You're going to do
exactly what I tell you.

249
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,209
<i>Stand by.
I hear him coming.</i>

250
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:17,832
Laitanan's back.
I need to listen to this.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Excuse me.

252
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,292
I spoke to my men.

253
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,372
Did you get your buyer?

254
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:32,004
He agreed to the money.
He'll be at the garage in 20 minutes.

255
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,355
Very good.
We've a little time to catch up.

256
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:38,134
- Do you still like your single malts?
- Not right now.

257
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,528
- You sure? It's a 30 year.
- No, thanks.

258
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,067
What you said earlier...

259
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,694
down at the river.

260
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:48,569
You were tired of living,

261
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,382
wanted to die.

262
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:53,307
What happened to you?

263
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:55,203
Not important.

264
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,809
It is to me.

265
00:15:58,355 --> 00:15:59,538
Don't worry about it.

266
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:02,394
Once I make this deal,
none of it will matter.

267
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:06,798
You're not the only one
who's been suffering these last time.

268
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,684
It's hard for me to admit,

269
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:19,763
I never forgave myself
for what I did to you.

270
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,396
It's in the past.

271
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,068
Forget it.

272
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:29,333
<i>I don't want to forget it.</i>

273
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:33,533
<i>I had too much to drink that night,
I wasn't thinking clearly.</i>

274
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,204
Never heard you
apologize for anything.

275
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,926
It's definitely a first.

276
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,655
I'm trying to make things right.
Don't be such a bitch.

277
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,670
Was I being a bitch?
I should apologize.

278
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,587
You're something else.
You never back down, do you?

279
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:54,320
I've missed our little arguments.

280
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,066
You're still nervous around me.

281
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:08,693
I shouldn't be surprised.

282
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:10,846
It's not you.

283
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:13,546
<i>Someone else?</i>

284
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,158
- <i>What is it, then?</i>
- I'm just...

285
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:21,790
I'm nervous about the deal.
Could be a lot of money at stake.

286
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:25,903
There's more for you here
than just money, if you want it.

287
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,153
I didn't come here for this.

288
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,340
Really. All the people
you could've gone to,

289
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,637
- you knocked on my door.
- Because you're connected.

290
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:40,323
That's the only reason?

291
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:42,991
I don't believe you.

292
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:44,813
Not my problem.

293
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,383
You should watch your tongue.
You might lose it one day.

294
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:51,945
You said I could get cleaned up.

295
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:57,908
- Bathroom has a shower.
- Thank you.

296
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:06,333
Agent Ortiz, we need to move now.

297
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:26,813
Renee called her buyer.
He agreed to pay.

298
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,551
I want you to meet with him.
Take a couple men.

299
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,901
It's a mistake.
Getting involved in nuclear arms.

300
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:34,931
It doesn't matter
how much money is at stake.

301
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,801
I have no intention
of pursuing this deal.

302
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:38,783
What?

303
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:41,236
When you've picked up the buyer,

304
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,663
when the money has been transferred,

305
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,387
you kill him, put him in the river,
keep the money for ourselves.

306
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,961
What about Renee?

307
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:54,926
She'll be working
with us from now on.

308
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:57,587
We are going to kill her buyer.

309
00:18:57,782 --> 00:18:59,996
She's not going
to be happy about that.

310
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,203
You heard what she said.
She's got nothing left.

311
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:04,316
Nowhere to go.
Desperate woman.

312
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,588
I give her reason to live.

313
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,568
I'll take care of it.

314
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,959
President Hassan's security,

315
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,546
still cracking down on the opposition,
and not showing any signs of letting up.

316
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:38,593
Your warning to President Hassan
has fallen on deaf ears.

317
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,555
- Who filmed this?
- The BBC bought it from an eyewitness.

318
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,141
They've already seen it
on Downing Street.

319
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,380
That's why Ethan wanted you
to see this now.

320
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:49,187
The rumors have already started

321
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,312
that the British are pulling out
as signatories to the accord.

322
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:54,192
I need to talk
to the prime minister.

323
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:56,652
It's not just the British,
Madam President.

324
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:58,154
The Germans and Egyptians

325
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,398
are also positioning
themselves to pull out,

326
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,243
- if we lose their support...
- The peace deal is dead.

327
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:07,563
Maybe if they understood
the circumstances that Hassan's trying

328
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,198
to prevent his brother
from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

329
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:11,940
With respect, Madam President,

330
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,993
sharing that with the delegates
might spread a panic.

331
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:16,320
You're right,

332
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,258
but I still need to buy some time.

333
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:25,234
Assemble the representatives

334
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,923
from every signatory country
attending the conference.

335
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,992
I want to appeal to them myself
to stay the course.

336
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:33,565
What about President Hassan?

337
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,385
Shouldn't we include him?

338
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,074
Not until I've taken the temperature
with the delegates.

339
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,036
I don't want to push him too hard.

340
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,328
What is it?

341
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:51,873
As you requested,

342
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:53,986
these are backgrounds
on all the detainees.

343
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,699
Our security police have completed
their initial sweep of the capital city.

344
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,757
65 known members have been arrested

345
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,218
- and are being questioned.
- You learned anything?

346
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:05,013
Were any of them
working with my brother?

347
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,756
It's too early to tell.

348
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:13,354
What's wrong?

349
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,870
One of the suspects...

350
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:21,604
has family connections to a member
of my delegation here at the UN.

351
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:22,697
Who?

352
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,400
Jamot.

353
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:25,700
They're cousins.

354
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,663
That doesn't mean
that Jamot's involved in any of this.

355
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,643
We need to make sure.

356
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:36,586
We'll check his phone records
and other recent activities.

357
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:37,946
Good.

358
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:40,006
But I want him into custody.

359
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:42,222
- Sir?
- Arrest him.

360
00:21:43,131 --> 00:21:44,469
Take him to our embassy.

361
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:48,056
Mr. President, with respect,

362
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,646
Jamot is a trusted member
of your inner circle.

363
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:53,040
The evidence against him
is purely circumstantial.

364
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:58,596
I trusted my brother as well.

365
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:02,570
Are you sure?

366
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:05,573
He is a public official.
It will not go unnoticed.

367
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,824
I don't care!

368
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:11,176
I don't care what anyone thinks.

369
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,640
I was almost killed today.

370
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:17,877
Or have you forgotten?

371
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,418
I was in the car with you, sir.

372
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:23,498
Then you should know
what needs to be done.

373
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,469
Yes, sir.

374
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,507
Forget about me?

375
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:06,423
What?

376
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:09,336
My name's Arlo Glass.
I'm one of your coworkers at CTU.

377
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:12,494
You said you'd free up some memory space
on the auxiliary servers.

378
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:13,850
I'm getting to it.

379
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,915
When?
We're in the middle of an operation

380
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,028
and my aerial feed
is running in slow-motion.

381
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:19,703
It's next on my list.

382
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,502
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

383
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:23,860
Is that okay with you?

384
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,900
- You notice anything about Dana?
- Miss Perfect?

385
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:35,788
She seems distracted,
always making excuses to leave.

386
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:38,345
- Maybe she's avoiding you.
- What?

387
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,877
That's what I would do
if someone were drooling over me.

388
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,338
- You're lucky she hasn't reported you.
- If you weren't so jealous,

389
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,946
you'd see I was asking you
a serious question.

390
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,720
I'm jealous.

391
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,431
Please, won't you stare
at my ass as I walk away?

392
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,502
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

393
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:12,694
Stay here.

394
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:26,928
This has the address
and schematic of the evidence lockup.

395
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:29,142
You'll go through
the southeast entrance.

396
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,230
This keycard will get you access.

397
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:34,764
How do we find the money?

398
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,101
The evidence bins are numbered.
You're looking for 4301.

399
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,917
This is a dedicated comm unit.

400
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,648
You'll be able to hear me.

401
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,525
Do exactly what I tell you to do

402
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,944
and you'll be in and out.
No one will know.

403
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:54,957
I help you do this

404
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,400
and you never call me again.

405
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:58,996
That's the deal, right?

406
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:01,698
Sure Jen,

407
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:03,876
that's the deal.

408
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:09,054
I'll call you
when we get to the lockup.

409
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,385
You look thin.

410
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:57,763
Be out in a minute.

411
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:00,600
I don't want to wait.

412
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,297
Vladimir please,

413
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:05,229
just let me get dressed.

414
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,723
Why waste the energy?

415
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:09,192
I'll just have to get you
undressed all over again.

416
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,782
I already told you
I didn't come here for this.

417
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,577
That's what you say,
but part of you came here to see me.

418
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,703
Admit it.

419
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:22,872
<i>There's nothing to admit.</i>

420
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,476
Why is it so hard for you
to admit the truth?

421
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,961
You want this just as much as I do.

422
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,630
I'm not going to tell you again.

423
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,007
Leave me alone
and let me get dressed.

424
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:36,469
Come here.

425
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:40,339
I said come here.

426
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:47,705
Come here

427
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:49,125
or get out.

428
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,544
<i>I call my men and the deal's off.</i>

429
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,624
I'll take that drink now.

430
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:31,870
Dry yourself off.

431
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:33,859
Come out when you're ready.

432
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,313
<i>Renee, do you copy?</i>

433
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:53,199
You don't have to do this.

434
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:55,381
We can get you out of there now.

435
00:27:56,351 --> 00:27:57,966
Where would that leave us?

436
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,714
I've got to stay under.

437
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,214
<i>We'll find another way.</i>

438
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,483
There is no other way.

439
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:11,311
<i>Don't do this.</i>

440
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,597
Go meet Vlad's men.

441
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,777
- See you when you get here.
- Why won't you listen to me?

442
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:19,405
- I'm going dark.
- Wait...

443
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,510
These arrests are making it
very difficult for my government

444
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:53,633
to continue to support
the peace agreement.

445
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:56,734
President Hassan can't ignore
the repercussions of what he's doing.

446
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,227
I know President Hassan.

447
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:00,571
He is a rational man, a good man.

448
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,482
There must be a reason
for these actions,

449
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,256
and I'm not just speaking
as his delegate but as his friend.

450
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:07,078
As his friend,
you need to let him know

451
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,340
that my government is not the only one
with grave concerns.

452
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,096
- This conference could fall apart...
- Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.

453
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:16,337
Mr. Jamot,
may I speak with you privately?

454
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:18,549
Yes, of course.
Excuse me.

455
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,507
Of course.

456
00:29:21,114 --> 00:29:22,164
What is it?

457
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,096
I've been ordered to escort you
to the embassy for some questions.

458
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:28,808
- Regarding?
- An internal security matter.

459
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,433
Please come with us.

460
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,230
- What is this about?
- We'll explain at the embassy.

461
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:38,026
It will have to wait.
I am about to go into a meeting.

462
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,401
It cannot wait, sir.

463
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:41,987
We need to go right now.

464
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,163
Are you arresting me?

465
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,393
It would be best
if we kept this discreet.

466
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,807
This is outrageous.

467
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:56,818
I demand to speak
with President Hassan.

468
00:29:56,943 --> 00:29:59,338
President Hassan is the one
who gave this order.

469
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,779
I will not ask you again.

470
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:03,102
Come with us.

471
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,724
Very well.

472
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,859
Take him to the car.
I'll be right there.

473
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:22,820
- Is everything all right?
- Fine, sir. Please excuse me.

474
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,689
It's me. Are you alone?

475
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,125
Why do you sound upset?

476
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,129
I didn't want to burden you,
but we need to speak about your father.

477
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:45,759
- What is it?
<i>- I have to go to the embassy now.</i>

478
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,527
I'll meet you in private
when I get back.

479
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,554
You're going to give him vindesine
twice daily, morning and night.

480
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,617
Inject it right into the I.V. bag,
just like I'm doing.

481
00:30:58,294 --> 00:30:59,895
You're going to want to be careful.

482
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,105
Radiation poisoning is transferable
through bodily fluids.

483
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,375
- Are you paying attention?
- Yes, I see.

484
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:11,098
He's also going to get
cisplatin every other day,

485
00:31:11,462 --> 00:31:14,837
but he can take that in pill form.
I'll give you three weeks' worth.

486
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:17,458
How will I know
if he's getting better?

487
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:20,252
If the treatment's working,
his symptoms will begin to subside

488
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,970
in seven to ten days.

489
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:26,743
We're going to be leaving soon.

490
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:28,463
- Where?
- To the country house.

491
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:31,720
The doctor's giving me
everything I need to treat you.

492
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,037
You're going to get better.

493
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:38,644
That's the nurse
with the rest of the medicine.

494
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:54,828
Throw down your weapon, Josef.

495
00:31:58,572 --> 00:31:59,667
Do what I said.

496
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:01,919
Don't make this worse than it is.

497
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,633
Drop it!

498
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,101
You son of a bitch.

499
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,853
Who else knows
about Oleg's sickness?

500
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:23,080
- Who else knows?
- Just the doctor.

501
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:24,900
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

502
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:26,509
Undo him.

503
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,582
Wait, stop.
What are you doing?

504
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:34,785
Your father sent us
to bring you home.

505
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,172
Now, Josef.

506
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:39,373
It's okay.
Just do what he says.

507
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,594
I have him.

508
00:32:53,894 --> 00:32:55,536
- We found them.
- Where were they?

509
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:57,124
<i>A clinic in Mount Vernon.</i>

510
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,300
How many people found out
about Oleg?

511
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:00,936
<i>Only one... a doctor...</i>

512
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,431
but we've taken care of him.

513
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:04,606
- Nobody will know we were here.
- Good.

514
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,563
Now, bring my sons to me.

515
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:10,597
Let's go.

516
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,459
That's right.

517
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,395
You are from Germany.

518
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:45,252
<i>Bremen.</i>

519
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:47,405
But I grew up traveling
with my father.

520
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:29,233
Are we going to do business or not?

521
00:34:29,454 --> 00:34:30,780
Where is the $5 million?

522
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,093
You don't see any money
until I talk to Laitanan.

523
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,553
If you have questions,

524
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,150
ask me.

525
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:37,783
I don't want to talk to you.

526
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:40,953
Get him on the phone
or I drive away.

527
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:42,579
Now.

528
00:34:57,937 --> 00:34:58,929
<i>Meier's here.</i>

529
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:02,474
He won't transfer the money
until he speaks with you first.

530
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:04,977
Put him on.

531
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:11,132
This is Meier.

532
00:35:11,257 --> 00:35:12,507
Yes, Mr. Meier.

533
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:15,503
- What's the problem?
- After you get your money,

534
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:18,402
- how long till I get my information?
- Not very long.

535
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:21,034
I just have to make a few calls.
No more than an hour.

536
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,202
Where is Renee?

537
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:24,371
She's busy.

538
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,002
I would like to talk to her.

539
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:29,209
You can see her when you get here.
We have nothing more to discuss

540
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,628
until the money's in place.
Now, get Lugo on the phone.

541
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:34,381
Fine.

542
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,054
Go ahead.

543
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:44,964
Once the money is confirmed
into our account, you know what to do.

544
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:50,744
I need your account number.

545
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,828
I'm transferring through multiple
accounts so it can't be traced.

546
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,696
This will take a moment.

547
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,168
We'll wait.

548
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:24,552
Is it done?

549
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:28,089
- Not yet.
- My partner's good for the money.

550
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:30,374
You should be making calls,
tracking down the rods.

551
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:33,982
I won't make any calls, there isn't
going to be any deal with your partner.

552
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,090
What are you talking about?

553
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:38,695
Once we have the money,

554
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,282
it's over.
We don't need him anymore.

555
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:44,672
And we'll be $5 million richer.

556
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:46,036
You son of a bitch.

557
00:36:46,317 --> 00:36:49,638
I'm not about to get involved
with people who traffic in nuclear arms.

558
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:51,708
Vladimir, you can't do this.

559
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,585
Why?
This man mean something to you?

560
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,997
I worked for more than a year
to make this deal.

561
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:58,328
I won't let it go
because you don't have the guts.

562
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,467
This isn't about guts.
This is about being smart.

563
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,500
Really?

564
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,312
Is it smart to keep selling small arms
for the rest of your life?

565
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:06,737
I bring you the score of a lifetime,
and you piss it away?

566
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,141
For what, $5 million?

567
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,686
- How long is that going to last you?
- Long enough.

568
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:13,208
You're more than all this.

569
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:14,606
I know it.

570
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,150
It's why I brought this deal to you.

571
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,319
We can do this.

572
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Together.

573
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,534
Once we've made the deal
and we have the money,

574
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:28,537
we can be together.

575
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:32,262
We could start over.

576
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:34,822
Make our own moves.

577
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:38,062
But I need my buyer.

578
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:39,873
Alive.

579
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:45,596
Sorry.

580
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,810
This is the way I want it.
You'll see.

581
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,335
It's for the best.

582
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,720
What are you doing?

583
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:56,193
Making a call.

584
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,113
Put down the phone.

585
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,266
I said put it down!

586
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,658
Don't ever go against me!

587
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,276
Renee, you should know that by now.

588
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:37,648
How much longer?

589
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:39,166
It's almost done.

590
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:46,406
There.

591
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,118
The money's in your account.

592
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:53,094
Thank you, Mr. Meier.

593
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,254
Drop the weapon.
Now! Drop it!

594
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,566
You think I'm that stupid?

595
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,348
That I'd come here alone?

596
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,308
Call your man. Do it!

597
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:18,773
Give me the phone.

598
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:25,561
I see we have the money.

599
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:26,738
Is Meier dead?

600
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,784
No,
I've taken out three of your men,

601
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,149
<i>and I'm ready
to take out the fourth.</i>

602
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:34,799
You really think
you can roll me for $5 million?

603
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:36,822
<i>Where's Renee?</i>

604
00:39:37,123 --> 00:39:38,625
She's right here.
She's fine.

605
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,143
I want proof now!

606
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:44,017
Say something to your partner.

607
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:45,642
Meier, are you okay?

608
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:48,434
Satisfied?

609
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:51,641
Renee told me you were ready to take
your organization to the next level.

610
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,110
- <i>Apparently, she was wrong.</i>
- Not necessarily.

611
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:56,226
I'm willing
to reconsider the situation.

612
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,902
The only thing
you should consider yourself is lucky.

613
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:01,997
And I still want this deal to happen.
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

614
00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:04,126
You try something,
we're going to war,

615
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:05,777
that's the last thing you want.

616
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:08,238
Let me talk to my man.

617
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:09,239
Fine.

618
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,039
Bring him back here.

619
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:18,586
<i>Are you sure?</i>

620
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:25,964
He wants to see you.

621
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:27,716
Get up.

622
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:35,932
Move to the driver's-side door.

623
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
Slowly.

624
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,039
I'm sorry, Oleg.

625
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:03,498
Leave us.

626
00:41:10,497 --> 00:41:12,002
I couldn't let him die.

627
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:13,804
He's my brother.

628
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:15,923
And he's my son.

629
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:18,998
Do you think
this is any easier for me?

630
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:20,573
It would've worked.

631
00:41:20,872 --> 00:41:22,771
The doctor was treating him.

632
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,436
You disobeyed me, Josef.

633
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,461
You put this family at risk.

634
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:29,872
You put this family at risk
when you sent those men into the clinic.

635
00:41:29,997 --> 00:41:31,685
They killed three people!

636
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,825
What do you think's gonna happen
when the police start to investigate?

637
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,544
Who are you to question my judgment?

638
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:40,911
You are my first-born.

639
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,246
You, of all people,
should give me respect.

640
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:44,988
I do respect you.

641
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:47,087
But this time you're wrong.

642
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:50,465
The doctor said
that Oleg could be treated.

643
00:41:50,997 --> 00:41:52,347
He showed me how!

644
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,177
All we need is the medicine!

645
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:58,285
There are rules, Josef.

646
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,143
They are simple rules.

647
00:42:03,122 --> 00:42:04,735
And they must never be broken!

648
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,991
Never endanger the family, never.

649
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,860
And never disobey my orders.

650
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:14,998
No, please.

651
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,326
You made me do this, Josef.

652
00:42:20,296 --> 00:42:21,446
Please don't.

653
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,835
I'm sorry, my son.

654
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:36,498
Get up.

655
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,136
Now, call Father Gregor.

656
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,361
He'll pray over Oleg.

657
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:47,323
When he's finished,

658
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:49,288
we'll bury your brother.

659
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:57,949
Never disobey me again.
