3
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,222
You know I have the fuel rods.

4
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:17,850
<i>But I have no desire
to harm innocent Americans.</i>

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,446
And yet you're threatening them
with a bomb.

6
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:23,674
<i>What I'm asking for is simple.</i>

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,274
Turn over Hassan.

8
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:27,276
That will never happen.

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,488
You have exactly one hour
to change your mind.

10
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:32,198
We have an out here.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,455
We should take it.

12
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:35,618
Give in to the demand

13
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,953
to turn over Hassan?

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,471
I will not sell him out

15
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:41,374
to the very terrorists
that we are determined to defeat.

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,251
- What are you suggesting?
- A covert action.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,092
We deliver Hassan to the terrorists,

18
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:48,172
but make it look like
they took him hostage.

19
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,410
I'm begging you.
Don't do this.

20
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,927
Don't betray the President.

21
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:56,973
All right.

22
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,587
My God!
Call a medic.

23
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,437
We wait to acquire Hassan
before calling an ambulance.

24
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,647
Understand?

25
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:15,180
Take the weapon off now!

26
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,202
A dirty bomb
will be detonated in New York

27
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,870
unless we deliver Hassan.

28
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:23,286
- Does the President know about this?
- She's refusing to deal.

29
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,084
This is General Brucker's operation.

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,111
What are you doing?

31
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,092
This is on you now.

32
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:30,965
You have to deliver Hassan.

33
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,134
I don't take orders
from anybody but the President.

34
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:34,562
Now, move.

35
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,722
Are the Americans
handing over Hassan or not?

36
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,933
The only information is that he's being
transported to McGuire Air Force Base.

37
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:43,583
So, President Taylor doesn't intend
to give him up.

38
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,733
<i>The President has not responded.
Start the countdown.</i>

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,279
The NYPD
will handle HAZMAT and triage,

40
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,247
the National Guard
will control the streets,

41
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,537
and I've got
an army battalion standing by.

42
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:42,064
A dirty bomb is about to go off
in Manhattan, Commander.

43
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,196
I'd plan for mass panic.

44
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,358
Ethan Kanin is dying back there.
We need to get him medical help.

45
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:49,750
- We will.
- I mean now.

46
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,878
No, not until our team
completes its mission.

47
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,770
When we have the bomb,
then we'll get your friend help.

48
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,195
Madam President.

49
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,001
Carry on.

50
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:00,346
General, what's our status
on the ground?

51
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,212
The civilian first responders
are positioning for rapid deployment,

52
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:05,491
and we've got army support
available as necessary.

53
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:08,707
At this point, only command level knows
we're anticipating a radiological device

54
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:10,734
but people
are quick to connect the dots.

55
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:13,317
- Word will get out.
- Yeah. I'd like to get ahead of that.

56
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,599
I've drafted an address
for the networks.

57
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:18,948
I need you to look at it.
And Ethan has to read it too.

58
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,408
He wasn't in his office.
Do you know where he is?

59
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,245
I'll go find him.

60
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,359
Less than ten minutes.

61
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:32,639
Dear God, this bomb cannot go off.

62
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,753
I'm sorry, Madam President,
but we have to prepare for the worst.

63
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,925
What are
the latest casualty figures?

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,522
Median scenario shows
58,000 dead over three days

65
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,649
due to the bomb and ensuing panic.

66
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,767
But who knows?
Maybe we'll get lucky.

67
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:52,424
Let me know
the second President Hassan arrives.

68
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:16,922
This is not right.
My life for so many others.

69
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:21,218
- It's not right.
- The President doesn't see it that way.

70
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,388
She knows I would disagree.
That's why she kept me out of it.

71
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,197
You are more than just one life.

72
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:35,134
You are the best hope of ending a war
that has lasted for decades.

73
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,636
You must understand
Taylor's trying to protect that.

74
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:39,153
This is not acceptable.

75
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,479
Get in here.

76
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,539
Get down.

77
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,854
- What are you doing?
- He's slowing us down.

78
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,213
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
His injuries aren't lethal.

79
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,148
Can I talk to you?

80
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,033
What?

81
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,302
Hassan isn't happy about Taylor's
response to the ultimatum.

82
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:07,640
Doesn't matter.

83
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,492
- He's a head of state. Maybe it should.
- It's not our call.

84
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:13,228
If he wants to take it up with her,
he can do it when he sees...

85
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,439
Mom!
What?

86
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,983
- Throw your gun down.
- What are you doing?

87
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:20,534
Kick it to me.

88
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:23,405
Have you lost your mind?

89
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:28,160
You, outside!
Back up inside!

90
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,747
- Sir, you do not want to do...
- Just shut up and move it inside!

91
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,592
I'm giving you what you want.

92
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,167
Here, take the gun.

93
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,169
What are you doing?

94
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,587
I'm sorry, Dalia.

95
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,130
My life for tens of thousands?

96
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,699
- I couldn't live with that.
- Omar, don't.

97
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:45,766
- You can't give yourself up.
- I have to.

98
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,262
What if they're lying?

99
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:50,938
What if they blow up
the bomb anyway?

100
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:53,004
At least I've tried
to stop the attack,

101
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,429
and I've failed.

102
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,064
- But if I don't even try...
- Father, please.

103
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,650
You stay here with Kayla.

104
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,275
I'll send someone to pick you up.

105
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,236
I won't leave you.

106
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,723
- Do as I say.
- If you want me to stay here,

107
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,365
then lock me in that room

108
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,909
because I won't let you
walk to your death!

109
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,203
- I won't leave you!
- Dalia, I said do as I say!

110
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:12,997
Back in the room!

111
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,206
Now!
In the room!

112
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,255
We've got less than five minutes.
We got to move.

113
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,427
Mr. President, you can't trust him!

114
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,204
You can't trust him!

115
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:54,508
Come on.

116
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,430
These people owe you their lives, sir.
You're doing the right thing.

117
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:26,499
Excuse me.

118
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,113
- Do you have the package?
- Yes.

119
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:33,584
You're cutting it damn close.
You know that?

120
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,286
There were complications.

121
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,366
Jack Bauer found out
about our operation.

122
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,491
He's no longer a problem.

123
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:42,628
Casualties?

124
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:45,332
The entire unit.
Everyone but me.

125
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,134
You need to know that President Hassan
is cooperating with us.

126
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,509
<i>He's here by choice.</i>

127
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,378
What are you saying?
That he would have given himself up?

128
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:55,101
Yes, sir.
We got to move.

129
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:56,725
All right.
Stay on the line.

130
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:10,862
He'll be dead soon
if we don't do something.

131
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,950
Along with half of New York.
Bishop's on the line.

132
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,070
He's got Hassan.
Get ready to make the call.

133
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:26,171
Bishop, we're live.
You there?

134
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,132
We got two minutes.
Do it.

135
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:41,784
Rob Weiss,
President Taylor's chief of staff.

136
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,153
- Do you have Hassan?
- We're prepared to make the exchange.

137
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,693
- Prove it.
- Bishop, put him on.

138
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:50,346
He wants to talk to you.

139
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:56,201
This is President Hassan.

140
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,066
I'm prepared to give myself up,

141
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:01,959
if you stop the bomb.

142
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,072
So, President Taylor
changed her mind.

143
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:07,868
She wasn't willing
to meet your demands. I am.

144
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,864
- But I need assurances.
- Assurances?

145
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,270
- That the exchange will...
- It will happen exactly as you're told.

146
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,865
What you'll do
is exactly what I say.

147
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,593
Damn it.
We did what you asked.

148
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:21,621
Quit stalling.
We're running out of time.

149
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,176
He cut us off.

150
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,659
A minute and a half
till the bomb goes off.

151
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,675
Stop the bomb.

152
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:48,981
<i>Hassan will be arriving.</i>

153
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,790
<i>You know what to do.</i>

154
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:55,034
All right.

155
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:20,470
Bomb was supposed to go off yet.
There's no report of an explosion.

156
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,621
- What's happening on the ground?
- Sweep teams are looking. No luck.

157
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,019
According to the deadline,
we're on borrowed time.

158
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,564
The bomb is still out there,
still a threat.

159
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,316
We may have caught a break here.

160
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:33,878
Let's use it.

161
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,987
It's Jack, I need your help.

162
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,281
Reception is terrible.
I can barely hear you.

163
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:40,663
Can you hear me now?

164
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:44,369
President Hassan is giving himself up.
That's why the bomb didn't go off.

165
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,289
No one here knows that.

166
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,532
<i>And no one else can
until I talk to the President.</i>

167
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:52,310
- What's going on?
- I don't have time to explain.

168
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,339
Please, just contact Tim Woods.
He can get me a clean line.

169
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:59,070
But no one else can know
that I'm calling. Do you understand?

170
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:00,260
I'll call you back.

171
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,470
Who was that?

172
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,264
Search team.
Requesting updated grid assignments.

173
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,413
- Do you need some help?
- I'll ask if I do.

174
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,177
We're clear!

175
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,383
Keep them up here on the landing.

176
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:39,731
Nothing.

177
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,136
Get them back to President Taylor.

178
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:46,607
- What about you?
- I'm going to look for Hassan.

179
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:52,683
I just got off the phone with CTU.
We're going to find your husband.

180
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:56,693
But it's not safe here for you.
Continue on to the Air Force Base.

181
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,367
Agent Walker will help you get there.
She can be trusted completely.

182
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,196
Mr. Bauer, my father, he did

183
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,073
- what he thought was best.
- I know.

184
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,774
We're gonna get him back,
but right now we need to move. Let's go.

185
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,039
Jack, he gave himself up willingly.

186
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,126
- Maybe we should just let this happen.
- I already told you, it's not our call.

187
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,886
The President asked me to protect him.
That's what I'm gonna try and do.

188
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:19,331
So, please, just get them
to the Air Force Base.

189
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,925
Taxi!

190
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:29,750
- This is Bauer.
- I got a secure line.

191
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,695
Good. I need you
to do something else for me.

192
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,447
I'm on Seventh Avenue
between 53rd and 54th.

193
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:38,068
There's a security camera mid-block.
If you can get a feed, roll it back.

194
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,445
President Hassan was standing here
ten minutes ago.

195
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,620
I'll check.

196
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,584
Seven minutes past the deadline.

197
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,618
Do we have any idea
why the bomb didn't go off?

198
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,912
No. We're polling our civilian
counterparts, trying to determine that.

199
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,499
Maybe it's like you said.
We got lucky.

200
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,293
At the moment it looks that way.

201
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,735
What about President Hassan?
When will he arrive?

202
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,757
His transport was a Secret Service
operation. I'm not really in the loop.

203
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,967
- I'll look into it.
- No, I'd rather you find Ethan.

204
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,552
- I'll page him.
- No,

205
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,779
not page him, find him.
I need him here.

206
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:10,015
Please.

207
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:14,478
It's an urgent call from Homeland.

208
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Excuse me.

209
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:18,106
President Taylor.

210
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,775
Madam President, Jack Bauer.
Please don't say my name

211
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,787
or react openly
to what I'm about to tell you.

212
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,186
President Hassan
is no longer in my custody.

213
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:28,621
He got away
and he's trying to hand himself over.

214
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:31,809
- That's why the bomb didn't detonate.
- I'm afraid I don't understand.

215
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,830
You're being betrayed
by General Brucker.

216
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:37,702
<i>40 minutes ago we were attacked
by mercenaries under his command.</i>

217
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:38,627
Go on.

218
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,298
We managed to fight off the attack,
but Hassan turned himself over

219
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,996
to one of them in an effort
to stop the bomb from going off.

220
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:46,747
As we speak,
they're preparing to hand him over.

221
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:49,818
I'm assuming that is still something
that is unacceptable to you.

222
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:51,139
That is correct.

223
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,686
General Brucker leads this operation.
He communicates with the terrorists.

224
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,365
I need to know
where the exchange is gonna take place.

225
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,357
- You need to confront him now.
- I understand.

226
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,526
As soon as you have anything,
contact CTU.

227
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,185
- I will.
- <i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

228
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,288
Come with me, please.

229
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,372
- Chloe, you still there?
- I'm here.

230
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:18,560
What do you got?

231
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,971
Got the security camera feed
you were talking about.

232
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:24,396
Hassan got into a black SUV
at 6:08 with one other guy.

233
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:26,560
That's got to be the merc
he handed himself over to.

234
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:28,443
They were headed west
on 53rd Street.

235
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:30,808
I lost them
when they turned north on Tenth Avenue.

236
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:33,266
Redirect the satellites
to the Upper West Wide.

237
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,591
I'm on my way.

238
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:19,682
What now?

239
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:34,993
Who's this?

240
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,328
Listen carefully.

241
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:38,287
Hand the phone to the driver.

242
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:43,154
It's you, isn't it?

243
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:45,712
Hand it to him now.

244
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:50,425
He wants to talk to you.

245
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:54,262
Bishop.

246
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,328
This is what you need to do.

247
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,547
Listen to my instructions
and follow them.

248
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:02,246
Step out,
leaving the keys in the ignition.

249
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:04,338
Take the phone with you.
Do it now.

250
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,384
Walk toward the intersection.

251
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,424
When the light changes,
cross the street.

252
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:33,220
Stay inside the crosswalk.

253
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,370
Where's the bomb?

254
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,348
<i>Do what I say.</i>

255
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:41,142
The deal was Hassan for the bomb.

256
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:46,564
The light's changed.
Move.

257
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:01,934
<i>Where is it?</i>

258
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:04,082
Do what I say.

259
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:06,108
<i>Shut up.
Listen.</i>

260
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:11,506
<i>Stop now.</i>

261
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,303
<i>Don't turn around
or you get nothing.</i>

262
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,700
<i>Stand there and wait.</i>

263
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:22,274
Turn around. Walk toward the stand.
Look down.

264
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,059
Show me your hands.

265
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:26,182
Hands!

266
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:28,216
On the dash.

267
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,100
Where's the bomb?

268
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:33,033
Where is it?

269
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,460
Where is he?

270
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,933
- The General's in Mr. Kanin's office.
- With Ethan?

271
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,185
Not sure.
No one's seen him in nearly an hour.

272
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,728
There's something you need to know.

273
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,746
Your chief of staff
is with the General.

274
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,963
They appear
to be in on this together.

275
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:15,028
Are you saying
Rob Weiss betrayed me, too?

276
00:19:16,077 --> 00:19:17,030
I'm afraid so.

277
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:21,201
Do it.

278
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,740
Don't move.
Hands where we can see them!

279
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,408
Up!

280
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:03,808
Call medical.

281
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:06,204
Against the wall,
hands behind your head.

282
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,125
You need to see this.

283
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:21,456
Is he still alive?

284
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,495
He's had a serious cardiac event.

285
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,120
Get him out of here!

286
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:30,736
You stay.

287
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,419
Where is President Hassan?

288
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:41,030
Damn you, Rob.
Where is he?

289
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,432
I don't know.

290
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,375
Don't lie to me!

291
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,493
Tell me where he is.

292
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,079
No, I cannot.

293
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,958
And if it makes any difference,
this was not an easy decision.

294
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:54,291
It makes no difference at all.

295
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,004
It wasn't your decision to make.

296
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:57,801
With all due respect,

297
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:01,210
you were not elected to sentence
tens of thousands of Americans to death.

298
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:04,009
Is that how you justify this?

299
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,140
You have sold out a peace
I committed this administration to.

300
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:10,810
I've protected New York
and given you plausible deniability

301
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,145
- in an impossible situation.
- I don't want deniability.

302
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,725
I want Hassan!

303
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,334
We are on the verge of a peace

304
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:21,009
that has eluded this planet
for 50 years,

305
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,414
and you are throwing it away!

306
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,492
Tell me where he is.

307
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,806
The charge is treason.

308
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,452
It carries the death penalty,

309
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:37,837
and so help me God,
I'll throw the switch myself.

310
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:41,807
Tell me where he is.

311
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:43,332
It's not too late.

312
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,681
Too late.

313
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:50,577
They have Hassan.

314
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:51,768
We have the bomb.

315
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,745
The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd.

316
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,917
We'll get NEST team there
as soon as possible.

317
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,391
Damn you, Rob.

318
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:06,230
Really, Madam President?

319
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,368
New York City is safe.

320
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,069
Take him away.

321
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,487
Your attention.

322
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,502
I've just spoken with the President
at McGuire.

323
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:51,799
Rogue operatives have handed Hassan over
to the terrorists.

324
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:55,149
In return, they've got the location
of the dirty bomb.

325
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,797
93rd and Amsterdam.

326
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,378
Jack Bauer and NEST are already on-site
and disarming the bomb.

327
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:03,357
Our focus
is to recover President Hassan.

328
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,842
I've got satellite feed at 93rd.

329
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,418
Looks like we're back in business.
Put it up on screen, Arlo.

330
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,770
We know that Hassan was handed over

331
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,145
at that location
approximately ten minutes ago.

332
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,611
NSA feed only gives us still images.
We might have missed him.

333
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,886
We didn't.
There's Bishop's SUV.

334
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,541
- They must be close, find them.
- Someone's approaching the SUV.

335
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,576
- Any idea who that is?
- I can try to clean up the image.

336
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,712
Lost it.

337
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,288
They were heading east.
We can use the traffic cam footage.

338
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,157
You and Dana, find that vehicle.

339
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,708
As soon as you reacquire it,

340
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,076
let Jack know.

341
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:44,605
Dana, where are you going?
Hastings wants us to do this.

342
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,550
- I'll reroute some of the servers.
- Not now.

343
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:51,220
- It'll give us more processing speed.
- We can work with what we have.

344
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,492
Those are the rods
we were looking for,

345
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,929
packed in enough C4
to irradiate half of Manhattan.

346
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,372
As soon as they're extracted,
I want you to contact CTU.

347
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,289
Thanks.

348
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:20,917
Transfer him
back to holding in medical.

349
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,618
- Contact Hastings as you're en route.
- So it's real.

350
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:24,754
A dirty bomb.

351
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:29,332
Then we succeeded.

352
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:30,802
We saved Manhattan.

353
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:34,201
You betrayed your President
and your country.

354
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:36,084
Get him out of here.

355
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,270
- This is Bauer.
- <i>It's Chloe.</i>

356
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,563
We found Hassan.

357
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,277
He's heading north
on Amsterdam in a black SUV.

358
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,200
- How far north?
- About... 30 blocks ahead of you.

359
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:51,165
The President wants us to do
everything we can to recover Hassan.

360
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,900
She wants you to lead the operation.

361
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,314
- How many men are with him?
- We think only one, the driver.

362
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:57,653
Chloe, find me
a suitable ambush point.

363
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:00,339
I want clean lines of fire
from rooftop and street level.

364
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:03,489
To protect Hassan, we must take the car
and the driver out at the same time.

365
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:05,110
Tac teams are standing by.

366
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:07,803
- Is Cole with them?
- We expect him here any minute.

367
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:09,965
Then he'll have to quarterback
this op from CTU.

368
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,754
I'll get you real-time updates
on Hassan's position.

369
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:13,879
Copy that.

370
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:18,724
Cole's back.
I'll go get him.

371
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,028
- I'm so glad you're back.
- Me, too.

372
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:48,603
I heard we recovered the bomb.

373
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:50,773
Only 'cause Hassan
gave himself up to the terrorists.

374
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:52,787
Jack's putting together
an intercept operation.

375
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:54,514
He wants you to run it from here.

376
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,779
You'd better bring me up to speed.

377
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:00,446
What happened
to that probation officer?

378
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:02,692
I convinced him
I didn't know anything. He left.

379
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:04,725
- That's good.
- Yeah, it's good.

380
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:08,065
We'll get through this.

381
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:09,376
We will.

382
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:13,073
We should go.

383
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:21,807
You don't have to do this, Tarin.

384
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:25,175
You can pull over right now,
stop the car.

385
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:28,101
Believe me, I want to do this.

386
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:31,947
If you hate me so much,
stand against me at home.

387
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:33,349
Join the opposition.

388
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,002
Fight me openly, honorably.

389
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,483
I don't need to fight you, Hassan.

390
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:39,555
You have already lost.

391
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,049
So tell me, what's the plan?

392
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,749
You'll put me on trial?

393
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,969
A dark room and a video camera,
I suppose.

394
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,107
A man hiding behind a mask...

395
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,330
will read a list of my crimes

396
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,873
and cut off my head with a sword.

397
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,084
The world will be impressed.

398
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,419
You've done worse in your prisons.

399
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,737
What I did...

400
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:15,007
I did to unite our country,

401
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:16,959
to make us stronger.

402
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:18,234
That's a lie.

403
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:21,055
You just wanted
to hand us over to the Americans.

404
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,504
I wanted us to rejoin the world.

405
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:26,978
I wanted us to have peace.

406
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,146
You wanted
the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine.

407
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:33,521
You think I don't know you, Omar.

408
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,689
I watched over you
day and night, remember,

409
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:39,824
watched over you while you betrayed
your own wife with a Western whore.

410
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:45,164
You care for nothing but yourself.

411
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:56,424
Yes, I've made mistakes,

412
00:27:58,046 --> 00:27:59,969
but believing in peace
was not one of them.

413
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,184
Think whatever you like.

414
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:08,811
You won't be around to find out.

415
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:41,802
Just, just a moment.

416
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:52,855
They're going to treat you
on the base hospital.

417
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:56,275
But then I want you right back here.
That's an order.

418
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,659
Just a moment.

419
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:02,054
You have always been true to me.

420
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,330
I need you now.

421
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,240
Hurry back.

422
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:11,108
Take good care of him.

423
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:15,290
Mrs. Hassan and her daughter
have just arrived.

424
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:16,765
Thank you, Susan.

425
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:28,349
I am so relieved you're both safe.

426
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,377
Thank you, Madam President.

427
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,911
Do you know what is happening
with my husband?

428
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:33,813
We do.

429
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,242
He is in the hands of the terrorists,
but we're tracking him on satellite.

430
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:41,328
We're going in now
to monitor the rescue effort.

431
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,031
Do you want to join us?

432
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,693
Then go on in the situation room,
and I'll be there in a minute.

433
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:54,618
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

434
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,427
I didn't expect
to see you again, Ms. Walker,

435
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:07,054
but lately,

436
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,009
I have learned how few people
I can really trust.

437
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:13,185
I am glad you're here.

438
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,647
Thank you, Madam President.

439
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:20,635
But I think
I'd be of more use at CTU.

440
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Of course.

441
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:24,313
Susan will arrange a car for you.

442
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,948
Thank you, ma'am.

443
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:30,823
Thank you.

444
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,986
Jack Bauer and CTU
are running the operation.

445
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:55,318
We expect the intercept to occur
in a few minutes.

446
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,492
Ma'am, satellite feed's
coming in from CTU.

447
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,076
Jack, Hassan's vehicle
just crossed 130th.

448
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:16,582
I'm at 110th Street.
Do we have an ambush point yet?

449
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,913
Intersection of 161st and Amsterdam.

450
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,138
- Who we got for the take-down team?
- A special ops unit.

451
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,993
We'll trigger the traffic lights
to stop the vehicle at the intersection,

452
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:27,796
then heavy gun fire
into the engine block to disable it,

453
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,428
snipers to take out the driver.

454
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,847
- <i>That leaves you to reacquire Hassan.</i>
- And our perimeter?

455
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,641
Bridges and tunnels are closed.

456
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,727
So Riverside Drive is shut down, too.
He can only use Amsterdam.

457
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,801
- What about cross streets?
- All covered from 140th Street on.

458
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:42,026
If we don't spook him,
he'll drive straight in there.

459
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,693
Copy that. Leave us line open in case
there are any changes.

460
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,654
- You got it.
- What's our timing?

461
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,753
Given traffic flow, Tarin should hit
the intersection in eight minutes.

462
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:52,201
I can use traffic lights
to slow him down.

463
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,661
I'll let Taylor know.

464
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:57,587
I'm seeing some fluctuations
in the carrier signal on the subnet.

465
00:31:57,712 --> 00:32:00,227
- What's that mean?
- Maybe a problem with the trunk line.

466
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,336
We can't afford
to loose satellite feed.

467
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,622
That's how we lost the rods
in the first place.

468
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:06,423
Chloe, how's your workaround?

469
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,509
It's working fine.
Do I get check it?

470
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,869
We need you here.

471
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,097
I can check it
if you can watch my screen.

472
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:14,725
Thanks, Dana.

473
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:53,429
What are you doing here?

474
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,389
I could ask you the same.

475
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,372
Cole asked me to check
on the trunk line.

476
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,562
Except the trunk line's over here.

477
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:04,565
I can do it from here also.
I set up this system, you know.

478
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:06,516
Right. Sorry.

479
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,529
Then maybe you can explain
why they keep going down.

480
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,359
We were hit
with a massive electromagnetic pulse.

481
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:17,585
It's a miracle we could get anything up
and running again as fast as we did.

482
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,060
So, what are you doing now?

483
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,963
I'm running a diagnostic
on the trunk line.

484
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:33,177
So why were you looking at
a map of Manhattan then?

485
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:36,680
I was checking
the progress of the operation.

486
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:39,391
How I do my work
is none of your business.

487
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:42,632
Given that I've been having
to cover for you the entire night,

488
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:44,104
I think it is my business.

489
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:45,753
Fine.

490
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,839
You want to check up on me,
go ahead.

491
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:57,826
- You're really going to do this.
- Yeah, I am.

492
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,951
So, where are the diagnostics?

493
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,904
In the systems folder,
where they always are.

494
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:11,498
No, I mean...
where on our screen?

495
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:15,128
Thought you said
you were working on this.

496
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:17,289
I wasn't using diagnostics.

497
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,413
I was monitoring the voltage fluctuation
in the trunk line directly.

498
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:24,305
Really.
How?

499
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,724
I thought you knew everything.

500
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,673
<i>Arlo, where are you?
Hastings's looking for you.</i>

501
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:34,038
I'll be right down.

502
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:38,158
Hastings wants me on the floor.

503
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:41,495
I'll leave you to do
whatever you're doing.

504
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:44,204
Don't push it, Arlo.

505
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,783
<i>CTU is following you.</i>

506
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:11,358
Where are they?

507
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,916
They're all over you.

508
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,487
- There's an ambush set for 161st.
- I'm nearly there.

509
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,412
Why am I only hearing this now?

510
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:20,345
I am already doing far more
than I've been paid to do.

511
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,165
You need to calm down.

512
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,220
We knew this might happen.

513
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:26,665
Can you find me an exit?

514
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:29,897
There's one between 158th and 159th.

515
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:31,145
Parking garage.

516
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,233
158th, 159th.
Is everyone ready for this?

517
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:35,790
I will let Samir know,
and then it is up to him.

518
00:35:35,915 --> 00:35:38,203
It's only a matter of time
before this gets raced back to me.

519
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,843
I need to get the hell out
of here while I still can.

520
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:13,712
Hassan is crossing
over 148th Street.

521
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,939
I'm activating signals up to 160th.

522
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:28,685
- You took your time.
- I'm sorry. It got complicated.

523
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:31,897
- Is the trunk line going to hold?
- I think so.

524
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,203
Then we keep going.

525
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:36,151
- What's our timing, Chloe?
- Intercept: four minutes.

526
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,812
Jack, a visual on Hassan yet?

527
00:36:38,937 --> 00:36:41,281
- Negative.
- He's five blocks ahead of you.

528
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,862
- Roger that. Tac teams in position?
- They're good to go.

529
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:47,056
Nobody move until Hassan's vehicle
is stopped in the intersection.

530
00:37:09,107 --> 00:37:10,555
What are you looking for?

531
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:13,689
- We are being followed, aren't we?
- Shut up.

532
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,509
That phone call, it's a warning.

533
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:19,486
- CTU is onto you.
- I'm not afraid of CTU.

534
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,117
- Why are you looking behind you?
- I said shut up!

535
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,208
Tarin, it's not too late.

536
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,082
Give yourself up,

537
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,290
and I'll speak for you.

538
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:33,495
I won't warn you again.

539
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,633
You're on an island here.

540
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:42,593
There's no way out.
They'll find you.

541
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,711
Yes, they will.

542
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:46,434
Soon enough.

543
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,112
Damn it. They've made us.
He's breaking left. He's breaking left.

544
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,581
- Chloe, where are they going?
- Checking.

545
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,530
What's happening?
Why did he turn?

546
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:13,785
He's in a parking garage.
It extends across the block.

547
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,043
- How many exits?
- Only two.

548
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,198
He'll have to double back.
Where's the other exit?

549
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:19,796
- Broadway.
- I'll cover that.

550
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,873
Cole, pull your team
back from the ambush point.

551
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:23,948
- Cover the block.
- You got it.

552
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,046
<i>All teams, pull back and reposition.</i>

553
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:30,021
<i>Set a perimeter around the parking
garage between 158th and 159th.</i>

554
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:44,947
I've got him.

555
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,371
He's turning back.

556
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,873
Copy that.
All units converging on your position.

557
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,422
He's just moving deeper.

558
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,675
He's got no place else to go.
You got him.

559
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,540
- Where did they go?
- Inside the structure.

560
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,275
He's running for the roof.

561
00:39:35,669 --> 00:39:37,275
Move!
Move!

562
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:44,555
Where the hell is he going?

563
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,019
Coming straight at me!
Damn it!

564
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,705
Chloe, any movement
from the target vehicle?

565
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:19,311
No one could survive that.

566
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:39,352
Chloe, Hassan is not in the vehicle.

567
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:46,167
- You know where to go.
- What if he comes to?

568
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,028
He won't.
Not before you deliver him. Go!

569
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,031
I said go!

570
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:18,047
<i>It's me.</i>

571
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:20,443
- Have you got Hassan?
- We set up our ambush.

572
00:41:20,568 --> 00:41:22,310
We were about to take him down,

573
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:24,523
when the driver
deviated from his route.

574
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,400
<i>He managed to transfer Hassan
before I could get to him.</i>

575
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,729
Someone inside CTU
has got to be tipping them off.

576
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,375
- How is that possible?
- No idea,

577
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,380
but I've got
the driver's cell phone.

578
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:36,229
Soon as we can set up an uplink,
I'll be able to figure out who it is.

579
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:38,460
I'm on my way to CTU.
Do you want me to talk to Chloe?

580
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:40,300
Yeah, but no one else.

581
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:43,878
We need a secure area to run the uplink.
Get back to me as soon as you're ready.

582
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:50,048
Search the parking structure.
They switched cars. Move now.
