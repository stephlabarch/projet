3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:17,159
I'll be right back.

4
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,823
You said you had a video
implicating the Russian government

5
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,013
that were responsible
for Renee's murder.

6
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:36,488
I want that file.

7
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:38,454
Tell me where that file is,

8
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,581
- now!
- It's in a safety deposit box!

9
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,499
Where?

10
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,875
First Unity Savings.

11
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,002
I had nothing to do
with Renee's death.

12
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:52,218
You never give up?

13
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:00,309
<i>Bauer may have Walsh,</i>

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,637
but he can't have the evidence.
We've still got a chance to stop him.

15
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,108
I'm not the only one who can prove
that elements in your government

16
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,068
conspired to undermine
the peace process.

17
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:10,945
You expect me to kill Bauer for you?

18
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,560
You have the covert assets here

19
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,700
- to do the job.
- Maybe I do.

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,119
But I don't have
the resources to find him.

21
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,203
CTU does.

22
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,247
And the man in charge
of the search now

23
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,456
reports to me.

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,970
We got him.

25
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:28,713
Once they've Bauer,
I'll find out where they're holding him.

26
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,589
<i>Take him out while he's in custody.</i>

27
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,258
Freeze!
Police!

28
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,651
Do not move.

29
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:49,358
Tell me what I can do.

30
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,068
Nothing.

31
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:19,578
<i>This is Captain Walleki. I'm on scene.
You got that guy from the bank yet?</i>

32
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:22,044
- Just bringing him up, Captain.
- <i>Right.</i>

33
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:37,156
It's Cole Ortiz.

34
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,037
He says he's with CTU.

35
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:42,203
You were with this woman
at the bank.

36
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,288
Do you care to tell me who she is?

37
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:53,274
Her name is Dana Walsh.

38
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,024
Shot twice at close range...
Lot of powder residue,

39
00:02:57,149 --> 00:02:58,219
like an execution.

40
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:00,971
Thank you.

41
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,389
Get him to CTU,

42
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:03,878
now.

43
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:22,144
<i>The hit on Hassan is all arranged.</i>

44
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,328
<i>Bazhaev and his people
are taking care of everything.</i>

45
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,854
<i>I'm pleased to hear it,</i>

46
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,099
<i>but you could have just
as easily called to tell me that.</i>

47
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:34,111
<i>I wanted to know
if you've spoken to your superiors...</i>

48
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,472
<i>told them that I'm out
after this goes down.</i>

49
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,208
<i>I told them what you wanted.</i>

50
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:42,796
<i>He feels the same as me:</i>

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,683
<i>we have too much invested in you
to let you walk away.</i>

52
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:50,145
<i>You should be focused
on getting the E.M.P. device into CTU,</i>

53
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,027
<i>not on your boyfriend, Ortiz.</i>

54
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:55,901
<i>He's my fiancé, and I told you
to leave him out of this.</i>

55
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,927
<i>I warned you to stay away from him,</i>

56
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,947
<i>but you didn't listen.</i>

57
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,739
<i>And now you think
you have feelings for him?</i>

58
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:07,288
<i>You think you love him,
going to marry him?</i>

59
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:08,849
<i>Yes.</i>

60
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:10,732
<i>I am.</i>

61
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:13,821
<i>And if you have a problem</i>

62
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:16,346
<i>wrapping your brain
around that fact,</i>

63
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:19,633
<i>maybe I should talk
to your boss in Moscow.</i>

64
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:22,337
<i>You talk to no one but me.</i>

65
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,397
<i>We're done here.</i>

66
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:31,061
<i>Don't contact me again
until Hassan is dead.</i>

67
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,361
Hey, it's me.

68
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,252
I sent you a DAT video file.

69
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,992
Okay. I got it.

70
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:52,917
It's uploading right now.

71
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,144
Get me an I.D. of the man
in the video.

72
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,604
Also, I'm coming in hot,
so protect your systems

73
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,438
from getting flagged, do it now.

74
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,625
You need an I.D. on the woman?

75
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,761
She's dead.
I'll see you in a few minutes.

76
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:05,617
All right.

77
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,204
Jack Bauer's last known location

78
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:10,221
was First Unity Savings Bank
on Lexington,

79
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:13,669
where police responded to a 911 call,
apparently from Dana Walsh.

80
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:14,897
She's dead now.

81
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,415
Bauer killed her.

82
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,705
Cole Ortiz, who is known
to be aiding and abetting Bauer

83
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,195
is being brought here.

84
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,910
Now, I need everybody

85
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:26,283
not committed to the U.N. security task
to devote their attention to find him.

86
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:29,328
I want all cameras routed
through facial recognition

87
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,691
and calls monitored.

88
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:33,374
You don't have the bandwidth,
you steal it from other tasks.

89
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:36,919
If you think you have a lead,
you bring it to me immediately.

90
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,964
- Any questions?
- Why did they go to the bank?

91
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,007
Dana had evidence

92
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,135
of Russian guilt in Hassan's murder.
Maybe that's where she was stashing it.

93
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:47,680
There's no evidence,
the president dismissed this.

94
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:50,975
She went to the bank with Jack
to get something.

95
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:54,561
What she got was an explosive device
that made possible her escape.

96
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,021
It was her plan.

97
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:00,434
Jack Bauer can't accept the fact
that Dana Walsh was an enemy agent

98
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:03,612
working solely with the IRK opposition
to Hassan's government.

99
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,340
His grief over Renee Walker's
murder is causing him

100
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,327
to create this fantasy
about a Russian conspiracy.

101
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,997
The simple truth is, he's lost it,

102
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,874
and he's a danger to himself
and the community.

103
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,044
So let's stop
second-guessing the operation,

104
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,362
and find him.

105
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,680
Something is seriously wrong here.

106
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,745
Pillar's ignoring the key questions,
and the questions that he is answering,

107
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,852
- no one's asking.
- What are you getting at?

108
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,895
I think Jack's right,
this is a cover-up,

109
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,224
and Pillar's involved.

110
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,899
- Jack has that evidence.
- You don't know that.

111
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,070
It's all speculation.
It may be just like Pillar says.

112
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,030
Until I know otherwise,
I got my orders.

113
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,952
- I'm clear.
- You weren't kidding.

114
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,971
You said you were coming in hot.

115
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,593
All the police scanners
are talking about you.

116
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,759
They said you shot
and killed some woman.

117
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:01,920
Construction site on the East Side.

118
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:04,292
Was that the same woman
in the video?

119
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,955
Yeah. Did you I.D. the man?

120
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:08,752
I'm not going to, either...

121
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,099
till you tell me
what the hell is going on.

122
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,636
You saw the video.
Dana Walsh is a Russian operative.

123
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,153
She facilitated the assassination
of President Hassan

124
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:18,771
and the bomb attack that would have
wiped out the Upper West Side

125
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,175
if we hadn't stopped it.

126
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,037
I don't want to know about
what happened today, and I don't care,

127
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:26,205
but why you're out there on your own
and why everybody's after you.

128
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,319
Because the president tried
to lock me down.

129
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:30,282
- Why?
- I know she's trying to cover up

130
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,493
the Russian's involvement
in today's attack.

131
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:35,162
- Then why didn't you disappear?
- Because I can't!

132
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:41,335
Listen, I want to help you, Jack.
I really do.

133
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:45,470
I need you to be straight with me.
Tell me exactly what's going on.

134
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:59,728
The Russians took something from me.

135
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:04,399
Her name was Renee Walker.

136
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,833
They killed her inside my apartment.

137
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:12,574
And I need to make them pay.

138
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,081
All right.

139
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,965
Actually, I did I.D. the guy.

140
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:29,007
There he is: Pavel Tokarev.

141
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,460
Primary operative,
Russian intelligence.

142
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:39,268
Where is he?

143
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,429
I don't know exactly.

144
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,896
He's in the USA.

145
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,758
Came in a month ago
on a diplomatic visa.

146
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:46,986
Diplomat.

147
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,820
I tried to access
the Russian database in the embassy.

148
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:54,022
He didn't show up in the consulate.
He could be anywhere.

149
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,900
To keep everything quiet,
they'd have to be a small unit, right?

150
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,749
I think I've got an idea.
Get me a secure line.

151
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,708
Meredith. I didn't expect
you'd still be here.

152
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,063
Fact check called: there are
a few items left on the Hassan piece.

153
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,758
Abby can follow up on it for you.

154
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,233
I know. I just...

155
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,430
I need to make sure it's right.

156
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,131
I know what he meant to you.

157
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,060
It shows in this piece you wrote.

158
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,746
What a great man he was.

159
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:26,523
You've done him justice.

160
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,708
I hope so.

161
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:32,950
Miss Reed,
there's a call for you on 3.

162
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:33,906
Thank you.

163
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,682
Let me know
if there's anything you need.

164
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:52,966
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- Jack Bauer.

165
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,676
<i>Don't say anything, just listen.</i>

166
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:57,471
The people that you think
are responsible for killing Hassan

167
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:58,840
were not working alone.

168
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,304
They were being controlled

169
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:02,645
by people working
inside the Russian government.

170
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,520
- How do you know this?
- I have a video file that was made

171
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,551
<i>by a Russian agent
working out of CTU.</i>

172
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:10,736
<i>She made it for her own protection.
It explains the last 24 hours.</i>

173
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,070
Have you contacted the authorities
about any of this?

174
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,476
I can't. I'm being set up,
just like you were yesterday.

175
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,282
I need to get this evidence to you.

176
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,618
There's a coffee stand
of Turner's Department Store.

177
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,216
<i>Do you think you get there
in the next 20 minutes?</i>

178
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:24,331
Miss Reed...

179
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,566
yesterday I helped clear your name.

180
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,336
Right now I need you
to help clear mine.

181
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:30,896
Please.

182
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:33,317
Of course I'll help you.

183
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:35,676
I want to know the truth
as much as you do.

184
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,990
Thank you.

185
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,110
Thank you.

186
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,207
Take a seat.

187
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,716
- Where's Bauer?
- I don't know.

188
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,629
You're in some trouble here.
I assume you're aware of that.

189
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:16,925
Luckily for you, I'm in a position
to make all that go away.

190
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,096
I reviewed your record. You've had
a exemplary career up to now.

191
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:23,682
You're Pillar.

192
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,260
That's right.
Jason Pillar.

193
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:29,855
The president asked me to oversee
the effort to retrieve Jack Bauer.

194
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,462
Madam President?

195
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,568
You're a part of the cover-up?

196
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:40,641
I see here you served in Fallujah.

197
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,688
I spent two tours in command
of a marine unit in Baquba myself.

198
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,330
We're both soldiers.

199
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,701
So you understand,
when the commander-in-chief

200
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,920
deems actions
necessary to the national good,

201
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,857
it's not our place to question it.

202
00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:59,949
The truth is:
we're on the same side.

203
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:02,095
We both want what's best
for our country.

204
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,129
Bauer doesn't care about that.

205
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:07,726
He didn't give a damn about you,
just as long as it served his needs.

206
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,894
He used you.

207
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:13,732
Let's start over.

208
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,319
Do you know where he is?

209
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,359
Probably somewhere with the evidence
you guys keep saying doesn't exist.

210
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,496
You don't want
to be playing with me.

211
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:34,002
- What?
- We may have a line on Bauer.

212
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,816
<i>We intercepted a call.</i>

213
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,560
Last chance.

214
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,329
You don't take it, there's nothing
anyone can do for you.

215
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,566
Take him to holding.

216
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:02,001
Arlo got a cell phone intercept
report off of NSA's Echelon.

217
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,324
Keywords: Hassan,
Russian government, Jack Bauer.

218
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,952
- Did Arlo hear it?
- Not yet. All he's got so far

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,671
are the data handles,
but he's processing the voice matrix.

220
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,601
- Are we sure it's Bauer?
- No, not yet.

221
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:14,334
But the other side of the call
was to Meredith Reed.

222
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,629
She's the reporter
CTU arrested last night

223
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,667
before the first attempt
on Hassan's life.

224
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,452
Rumor has it
she was also his mistress.

225
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:23,510
If Bauer wants to expose the evidence,
she would be an excellent choice.

226
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,300
Stop what you're doing.
Tag and lock the intercept download

227
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:28,616
and send it directly to Eden.
She'll take it from there.

228
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,766
- That's not necessary.
- I want Eden to handle it.

229
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:32,041
Thanks, Arlo.

230
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,478
<i>There's a video file that was made
by a Russian agent working out of CTU.</i>

231
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:03,091
<i>She made it for her own protection.
It explains the last 24 hours.</i>

232
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,239
<i>Have you contacted the authorities?</i>

233
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:07,773
<i>I can't. I'm being set up
just like you were yesterday.</i>

234
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,694
<i>I need to get this evidence to you.</i>

235
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,110
<i>There's a coffee stand
of Turner's Department Store.</i>

236
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:13,943
<i>Can you get there
in the next 20 min?</i>

237
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:16,646
- Jack Bauer.
- Yes, sir. We confirmed the voiceprint.

238
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,645
Take it to the press.
That's his next move.

239
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,961
It appears to be.

240
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:26,359
Reed's connection to Hassan means
she'd be highly motivated to help him.

241
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:29,326
- And he hasn't shown her anything yet?
- No, sir.

242
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,627
Which still means that we don't know
what the evidence actually is.

243
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,052
It will be in our hands soon enough.

244
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:38,804
This is a major opportunity
to make everything go away, sir:

245
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:40,238
Bauer and the evidence.

246
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,613
I've dispatched
the Russian ops team to the location.

247
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,333
They'll be there before the meet.

248
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,420
You need to deal
with local law enforcement,

249
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,370
make sure Pavel has room to move.

250
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,498
We're deploying NYPD
away from the site,

251
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,065
but we'll still need your guys
in and out as quickly as possible.

252
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,967
Got it.

253
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:57,175
Jason,
this is a major break you've got,

254
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,952
a major break.

255
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:00,683
Thank you, sir.

256
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:02,095
We'll shut this down.

257
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,445
I want to stay on top of this
personally.

258
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,665
So will you let me have
Pavel's number?

259
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,708
Can you make this room less public?

260
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,298
- You wanted me?
- The call you intercepted...

261
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:33,816
the one that Pillar hijacked...
do you think it was from Jack?

262
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:35,121
I can't be sure.

263
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:37,448
The program hit on keywords
Hassan, nuclear, Bauer,

264
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,765
but all three have been in the news
in the last few hours.

265
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,523
But the call was to Meredith Reed.

266
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,105
She's a journalist with an interest
in the Hassan story.

267
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,236
Plenty of people
could be calling her.

268
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,854
Doesn't have to be Jack.

269
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,547
Okay, then explain this.

270
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,719
Cell intercept report comes in here.

271
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:54,077
Two minutes later, Pillar downloads
the entire conversation

272
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:57,038
into a segregated server surrounded
by firewalls like I've never seen.

273
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,791
Then what does he do?

274
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,876
Call one, call two, call three.

275
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,387
- Who'd he call?
- I don't know.

276
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,923
They're outside of CTU
and they're all completely masked.

277
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,410
So the question is this:

278
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,779
if the call was nothing,
then why are they still hiding it?

279
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,126
If the call was Jack,

280
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,347
then why haven't they dispatched
CTU SWAT team?

281
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:16,523
Why haven't they alerted NYPD?

282
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,062
They're in on the cover-up.
Look at them.

283
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:26,109
What's worst is,
they're planning on taking Jack out.

284
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,363
- Why would they want to do that?
- Because he knows too much.

285
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,161
He's gotten a hold
of Dana's evidence,

286
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,367
which proves the Russian guilt
in Hassan's death.

287
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,881
They can't let him
go public with that.

288
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:39,832
That's why I have to find him,
and I need your help.

289
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:50,967
How do you want to do it?

290
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:54,716
I'm gonna talk to Cole.
He spent the past two hours with them.

291
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,815
He must have some idea
of what Jack's up to.

292
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,796
Pillar's got Cole
continuously monitored.

293
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,016
You can't get in there
without being seen.

294
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:03,804
We'll create a loop
and graft it into the security feed.

295
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,192
That's the other problem: they added
a layer of oversight to our system.

296
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,405
Second I try to move
beyond my security clearance,

297
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,904
I get an on-screen warning.

298
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:13,851
They're watching
everything we're doing.

299
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,742
Fine.

300
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:25,293
We'll use this,
create a mobile hot spot.

301
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,630
That way we can work off our own net

302
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,548
- without Pillar watching us.
- Got it.

303
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,773
Setting up alternate network now.

304
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,488
We're up.

305
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:49,442
I'm restricting access
to you and me.

306
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,793
- How long to make the loop?
- I can only give you 90 seconds.

307
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,198
Anything more than that,

308
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,575
- somebody will notice.
- Text me when you're set up.

309
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:32,361
Fredericks, McDermott was injured
in the E.M.P. blast,

310
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,833
I need you to collect the time cards
and take them to my office.

311
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:38,241
Like now?

312
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:01,473
I've only got 90 seconds,
I'm gonna get straight to the point.

313
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,175
I need to find Jack
or else they're gonna kill him.

314
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,027
- Who's gonna kill him?
- Pillar

315
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,608
and whoever is working with him.

316
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,481
- Where is he?
- I got no idea.

317
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,592
You were with him,
he must have said something.

318
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,789
What Jack says and what he does
are two very different things.

319
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:18,281
- He's trying to expose the cover-up.
- He doesn't give a damn about it.

320
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:21,826
He's taking out anyone
who was anywhere near Renee's death,

321
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,621
starting with Dana.

322
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:26,623
She gave him the evidence
and he killed her anyway.

323
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,861
She took the gun out
of the deposit box.

324
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:32,128
- She was probably shooting at him.
- He shot her point-blank.

325
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,495
He executed her,
just like she said he would.

326
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:38,676
There are no good guys here.

327
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:44,642
They end up killing each other,
maybe it's the best thing.

328
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,714
Jack's my friend.
If I can find him, I can talk him down.

329
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,129
They're just going to kill him.
I need you to be on my side.

330
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,734
Everybody wants me on their side.

331
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,265
Who am I fighting for?

332
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:02,116
If we can get to him,
we can expose the cover-up.

333
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:09,330
You just stay here and feel sorry
for yourself. I'm gonna go find him.

334
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,167
Wait.

335
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:17,496
It's not much, but Jack's
got to be working with someone.

336
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,582
- Who?
- I never saw him,

337
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:22,262
but Jack showed up with weapons
and comms, so he's got to have

338
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,639
a contact in the city.
You want to find Jack,

339
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,433
- you find his supplier.
- Thanks.

340
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,427
You got out in time.
You okay?

341
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,435
I'm okay.
I know what Jack's doing.

342
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,023
Pull up his files,
get me the list of his associates

343
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,946
<i>in the tri-state area,
anyone he's worked with in the past.</i>

344
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,790
<i>In the next half hour,
the man who has widely been acknowledged</i>

345
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,625
<i>as the vital "third partner"
in the peace process...</i>

346
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,754
<i>Russian President Yuri Suvarov...</i>

347
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,579
<i>will touch down at JFK.</i>

348
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,088
<i>He'll be ferried into Manhattan
by helicopter</i>

349
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,460
<i>and then to the U.N.</i>

350
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,835
Pavel, update, please.

351
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:20,473
My team is in position.

352
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:22,367
<i>Any sign of Bauer?</i>

353
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:23,763
Not yet.

354
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:26,784
I need to know.

355
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,567
<i>What about the woman?</i>

356
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:31,073
The woman?

357
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:32,845
The journalist,

358
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,808
her disposition.

359
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,099
Ms. Reed is aiding
and abetting a terrorist.

360
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:40,548
She's a serious threat
to both our countries.

361
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,359
<i>Do what you have to.</i>

362
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,878
I see from Ethan's notes
that we still have not

363
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,230
completely resolved the issue
of site access for the inspection teams.

364
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:23,800
I believe it was resolved.

365
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:25,551
President Hassan agreed

366
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,637
the inspectors
would have right of passage

367
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,644
- over our entire country.
- But he exempted schools.

368
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,511
Only primary schools.

369
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:36,445
Omar didn't think ten-year-old children
would be building nuclear missiles.

370
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:41,325
Of course.

371
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,738
I remember now.

372
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:43,945
I do apologize.

373
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,766
Are you all right?

374
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,577
It's been a long day.

375
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,121
I'm fine.
Thank you.

376
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:04,007
If you'll excuse me for a few minutes,
there's someone I need to see.

377
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,175
Of course.

378
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,720
- Where is he?
- In the conference room.

379
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,856
Thank you for seeing me.

380
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,947
I have good news.
We've located Bauer.

381
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:23,411
He has the evidence...

382
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:26,561
You assured me that wouldn't happen.

383
00:23:26,686 --> 00:23:27,907
Let me finish.

384
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:31,075
We know exactly where Bauer will be
and when,

385
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,162
and we have an operation underway
to reacquire him

386
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,078
even as we speak.
Believe me,

387
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:37,999
this is good news.

388
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:43,640
Let me know
as soon as it's resolved.

389
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,490
I need to get back
to the negotiations.

390
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,265
There's just one thing.

391
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:53,765
We are three hours away
from the signing of the treaty.

392
00:23:54,828 --> 00:23:56,128
Isn't it time...

393
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:59,068
for my role in the process to be...

394
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,302
officially recognized?

395
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,857
I was thinking

396
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,535
some kind of...

397
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,154
announcement to the media,
perhaps by your press secretary,

398
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,573
or maybe even by you yourself.

399
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:15,745
It was, you'll recall, our agreement

400
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:19,707
that I would have a public face
on this historic day.

401
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,243
I believe I've earned it.

402
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,790
I will talk to my press secretary.

403
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,651
She will make the announcement

404
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,783
in time for the 1:00 o'clock news.

405
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,796
Thank you very much.

406
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:56,994
We have contact.

407
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,483
<i>Target heading
to the third floor escalator.</i>

408
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:00,706
Acknowledged.

409
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:03,228
I see her now.

410
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:05,837
<i>We have eyes on Reed.</i>

411
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,111
Reed is confirmed.

412
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,888
Units 2 and 3,
Reed is approaching you.

413
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,585
<i>Confirm contact.</i>

414
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,394
Reed confirmed.

415
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,354
Approaching the meeting place.

416
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,463
Any sign of Bauer?

417
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,026
Where is he?
He should be here.

418
00:25:28,683 --> 00:25:29,683
No sign.

419
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:40,501
- Pavel, do you see Bauer?
- Not yet.

420
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:44,432
<i>Unit 1, report.</i>

421
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,835
We have no visual of Bauer.

422
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:01,184
Jason, where are you going?

423
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,102
There he is.
He's heading up towards...

424
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,474
- I lost him.
- Bauer is on the third floor.

425
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,849
<i>Do you see him?</i>

426
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,300
I do not have him.

427
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:12,403
He's there.
Get your eyes open!

428
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,405
I have not seen him.

429
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:15,906
Got him.

430
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,034
Approaching the target
from the southwest.

431
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,827
Brown leather jacket and jeans.

432
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,640
There he is.

433
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:27,942
Pavel, he's in view.

434
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,464
<i>He's closing in on the café.
You should have a clean line on him.</i>

435
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:39,305
Pavel, if you have a shot, take it.

436
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,848
I've got him.

437
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,645
Put it down.

438
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,318
Everything's all clear
up at the top, Jack.

439
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,486
Copy that.

440
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:56,405
Come with me.
Do exactly what I say.

441
00:26:58,107 --> 00:27:00,493
All units, target is in the open.
Take him out.

442
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,657
<i>I repeat: take him out.</i>

443
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,254
You stay down here.
You don't move. Don't move!

444
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:34,556
Move!

445
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,690
What the hell just happened?

446
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,324
He knew it was a trap.

447
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:44,120
Don't let them out of your sight.

448
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,565
- We lost him.
- Just keep looking!

449
00:27:49,277 --> 00:27:51,605
- Who were they?
- Russian operatives.

450
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,389
- You have any problems?
- No.

451
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:57,485
Let's move.

452
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,159
Jason. Tell me.

453
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:25,786
I'm afraid I have bad news, sir.

454
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:29,636
<i>All of Pavel's team is dead,
and Bauer has Pavel.</i>

455
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,352
He was ahead of us
from the get-go, sir.

456
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,367
He must have anticipated
that we'd use Echelon,

457
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:36,295
and he put out a series of keywords,

458
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,712
knowing the listening stations
would pick them up.

459
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:42,255
He played us, sir. He knew we'd use
off-book resources to deal with him.

460
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,430
He used that journalist
to draw them out.

461
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:47,125
Now, sir, I hardly need to tell you

462
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,769
that the situation is grave.

463
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,957
<i>Pavel knows everything.</i>

464
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:53,314
<i>He ran Walsh,
he set up the Russian ops.</i>

465
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:55,983
If Bauer gets Pavel to talk...

466
00:28:57,881 --> 00:28:59,462
But at the moment, sir,

467
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:02,352
you still have complete deniability.

468
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:04,699
President Taylor made
all the decisions.

469
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:09,817
I think the time has come for you
to distance yourself from this mess.

470
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,006
It's regrettable, sir, deeply so,

471
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:14,460
but I believe
it's what's best for you.

472
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,530
20 minutes from now,

473
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:23,208
the president's press secretary
is going to make an announcement.

474
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,433
She will say

475
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:27,486
I have become part
of the president's team,

476
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:29,415
and I have been indispensable

477
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,709
in bringing this peace process
to a successful close.

478
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,313
That is a bad idea.

479
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:36,043
Distance yourself.

480
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:39,556
You keep using that phrase.
What does distance myself mean?

481
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,999
- Do I just slink away?
- This isn't your fault.

482
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:43,656
There were some circumstances.

483
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:44,784
Namely Bauer.

484
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,263
Then, we find Bauer,
and we neutralize him.

485
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:49,453
We're public now.

486
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:53,116
We're committed.

487
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:55,871
And I have worked...
We...

488
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:59,175
We have worked too hard

489
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,840
just to throw this all away.

490
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,175
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yes, of course, but Pavel...

491
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:07,555
Pavel is a good soldier.
He won't talk,

492
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,290
whatever Bauer does to him.

493
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,844
I put you at CTU, Jason,

494
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,642
for a reason.

495
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,512
They have huge resources.

496
00:30:18,637 --> 00:30:20,757
You have intelligence and tenacity.

497
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,300
You use those capabilities.

498
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:25,739
Find Bauer.

499
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,324
- I'll head down to the scene myself.
- Good.

500
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,289
Keep me posted.

501
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:38,502
He wants to move forward.

502
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:41,478
Does he understand
what actually happened?

503
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:44,008
Yes, but he says
we still have options.

504
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:50,055
I need to know
you're with me on this.

505
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:53,767
Yes, I'm with you.

506
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,270
Good. I'm heading out.

507
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:59,273
I'll clean up, remove all trace
of the Russians, get on Bauer's trail.

508
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:01,094
I'll take CTU SWAT with me.

509
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:03,611
Tell NYPD to put a two-block perimeter
around the store.

510
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,221
No one goes in or out.

511
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:07,037
- What do I say?
- National security.

512
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:09,704
Anyone gives you a hard time,
invoke the White House.

513
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:19,262
Any luck with Jack's associates?

514
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:22,255
No. Even discounting dead people,
and people from foreign countries,

515
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,655
- it's still going to take hours.
- I could narrow it down.

516
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,847
I just picked up a 911 call
from Turner's in Midtown.

517
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:30,079
There was a shoot-out,
people killed.

518
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:32,646
I managed to get
into the store's security system.

519
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,684
Oh, my God.

520
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,661
That's Jack.

521
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,120
They're trying to kill him.

522
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,360
That part of the plan
didn't go so well.

523
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,740
I tagged the footage 5 minutes
before to 5 minutes after the shooting.

524
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,531
If we run facial recognition
on the camera feeds...

525
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:52,468
We can match it to the database,

526
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:54,385
maybe find out
who he's working with.

527
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,247
Thanks, Arlo.

528
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,415
No problem.

529
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,168
Copy the camera footage to my screen.
I'll send you personnel files.

530
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,229
We're clear. Let's go.

531
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:38,320
Empty your pockets right now here.

532
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,297
Take a seat.
We'll be safe here for a while.

533
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,220
Jack?
We don't have much time.

534
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,052
Take off your coat.

535
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:06,455
Those people you killed...

536
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,986
you were ready for them,
weren't you?

537
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,543
You knew they were coming.

538
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:13,029
So you...

539
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,492
You knew they'd be listening
to our phone call.

540
00:33:15,914 --> 00:33:17,264
Isn't that right?

541
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:21,415
You used me to draw them out,

542
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,658
right?

543
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:24,001
Yes.

544
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,363
I could have been killed back there!

545
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:27,379
You weren't.

546
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,642
Now, pick it up.

547
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,869
I said pick it up!

548
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:37,139
What about the evidence?
Was that a lie, too?

549
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,271
The evidence is on this.

550
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:47,357
When you see it,
you'll know it's real.

551
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:51,195
Take it.

552
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:56,075
My partner's gonna take you
to show it to you.

553
00:33:58,088 --> 00:33:59,862
I'm sorry things
had to play out like this.

554
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:02,039
I didn't see another choice.

555
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:06,115
What are you gonna do?

556
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,420
Put your hands
behind your back. Now!

557
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,554
Don't do this.
You don't want to do this.

558
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,508
Take her to the storeroom.

559
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:16,365
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Please, you cannot do this.

560
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,889
The evidence doesn't tell me
how Walsh was involved.

561
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:20,923
He will.

562
00:34:22,222 --> 00:34:24,122
You cannot do this this way!

563
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:29,906
Sit over there.

564
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,075
Springfield, M1A rifle.

565
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,625
308 round.

566
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,930
You know, about four hours ago,

567
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,452
I had a friend of mine,
very good friend...

568
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:00,222
named Renee Walker was killed
by a rifle just like that.

569
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,015
Go to hell.

570
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:10,681
You first.

571
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:26,618
<i>The hit on Hassan is all arranged.</i>

572
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,209
<i>Bazhaev's taking care of everything.</i>

573
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,177
<i>You talk to no one but me.</i>

574
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,841
<i>We're done here.</i>

575
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:37,134
<i>Don't contact me again until Hassan</i>

576
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,302
<i>is dead.</i>

577
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,004
To be honest with you,

578
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:52,594
Renee Walker was more
than just my friend.

579
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,571
But you already know that,
don't you?

580
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:59,107
Because you saw us
in the bedroom of my apartment.

581
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,312
Now, you're either not very good
at what you do...

582
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:06,635
or you wanted her to suffer.

583
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:09,004
Because with that rifle
from that range,

584
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,879
it was an easy kill shot.

585
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:12,461
But instead,

586
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,210
you shot her...

587
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,637
right there,

588
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,947
two inches below her heart,

589
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,083
so she would bleed out slowly.

590
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,662
I watched her gasping for air...

591
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:26,422
as the blood
slowly filled her lungs.

592
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,101
She died in agony,

593
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,526
which is exactly
what I'm gonna make you do

594
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,151
unless you tell me
what I want to know.

595
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:47,871
Start talking to me!

596
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,626
You want to know
I killed your girlfriend?

597
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:56,462
I killed her.

598
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,507
I kill your bitch!

599
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,466
I did it!

600
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,862
Please, you've got to stop him.

601
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:10,602
He needs answers,
and he's gonna get 'em.

602
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,939
I can use this. There's enough here.
I don't need any more.

603
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,775
- Tell him I don't need any more.
- You're not going anywhere.

604
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:45,501
Move aside. Move.

605
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,281
Please step back from the bodies.

606
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,733
This is now a CTU crime scene.

607
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,284
I need all weapons
and documents you found on them.

608
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,479
This is all we got.

609
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,856
None of them had ID.

610
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,820
This is the man we're looking for.

611
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,351
His name is Jack Bauer.

612
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:09,328
You need to spread out
and check every floor

613
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,559
and every exit.

614
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:13,453
He has a hostage with him,
so he won't have gotten far.

615
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,084
He's armed and dangerous,

616
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,558
so if you don't want
to end up like these people,

617
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:19,933
shoot on sight.

618
00:38:20,212 --> 00:38:21,212
Let's go.

619
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,347
Why don't we start this again.

620
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:43,570
I already know that
you killed Renee Walker.

621
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,338
What I want to know...

622
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,783
is the name...

623
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,565
of the Russian pig

624
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,453
inside your government

625
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,447
... that gave the order.

626
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:59,503
Do it, and I'll end this quickly.

627
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,121
I give you my word.

628
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:19,439
You think you know about pain?

629
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:22,901
You don't know anything yet.

630
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:27,990
Give me the name of the person

631
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:29,825
inside your government

632
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,840
who wanted Renee Walker dead!

633
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:36,901
Who gave the order?

634
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:38,959
Who inside your government

635
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,335
wanted Renee dead?

636
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:43,338
All you got to do
is give me the name!

637
00:39:58,068 --> 00:39:59,818
You people are so stupid.

638
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:01,898
She wasn't

639
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,366
a threat to you.

640
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,569
Her work was finished.
She was done. We were out.

641
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,920
All you had to do is leave us alone.

642
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,613
Why couldn't you
just leave us alone?

643
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,043
I want the name of the person

644
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,503
who gave the order
to pull the trigger!

645
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:27,090
Who gave the order?

646
00:40:27,918 --> 00:40:29,843
- Now!
- Did it on my own!

647
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:32,370
You're lying.
You're nothing.

648
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:34,102
You didn't have the authority.

649
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:35,849
I want the name!

650
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,935
- Give me the name!
- My name is Pavel Tokarev.

651
00:40:56,464 --> 00:40:57,914
This isn't working.

652
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:13,261
Where's the SIM card for your phone?

653
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,015
Where's the SIM card?

654
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:23,119
Where'd you drop it?

655
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,487
You dumb bastard, you swallowed it.

656
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:40,415
You swallowed it.

657
00:41:43,057 --> 00:41:44,251
For my friend.

658
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:02,189
- What do you got?
- Clear, sir.

659
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,945
There's another service hallway.
Check all service hallways over there.

660
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,685
Make sure they're locked down.
You, I want you to go up there,

661
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,152
stay on the third floor.
Do it now.

662
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,757
<i>You've reached the mobile number
of President Charles Logan.</i>

663
00:42:57,882 --> 00:43:00,275
<i>We can't take your call,
but if you leave a message,</i>

664
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,615
<i>we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.</i>
