4
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,754
The people
that you think are responsible

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,102
for killing Hassan
were not working alone.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,642
<i>They were being managed</i>

7
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,953
<i>by people working
inside the Russian government.</i>

8
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,504
How do you know this?

9
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,903
I'm being set up.
I need to get this evidence to you.

10
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:32,517
Arlo got a cell phone intercept
report off NSA's Echelon.

11
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:34,194
Keywords: "Jack Bauer."

12
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:36,202
We confirmed the voiceprint.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,352
Reed's connection to Hassan means
she'd be highly motivated to help him.

14
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,207
Take it to the press.
His next move.

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,589
This is a major opportunity

16
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:46,379
to make everything go away,
Bauer and the evidence.

17
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:50,091
I need to find Jack...
Or else they're gonna kill him.

18
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:53,219
If we can get to him,
we can expose the cover-up.

19
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,262
- Jack is working with someone.
- Who?

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,141
I never saw 'em, but Jack showed up
with weapons and comms.

21
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:00,935
Pavel, do you see Bauer?

22
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,813
- <i>If you have a shot, take it.</i>
- I've got him.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,544
Put it down.

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,988
<i>Everything's all clear up on top.</i>

25
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:11,070
Come with me.
Do exactly what I say.

26
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,910
- Move!
- He knew it was a trap.

27
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,783
The evidence is on this memory card.

28
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:23,791
Take it.
When you see it, you'll know it's real.

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,628
<i>The hit on Hassan is all arranged.
Bazhaev is taking care of everything.</i>

30
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,172
I already know
that you killed Renee Walker.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,883
What I want to know
is the name of the Russian pig

32
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:35,970
inside your government
that gave the order.

33
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:37,847
Where's the SIM card?

34
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,306
You dumb bastard, you swallowed it.

35
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,229
This is for my friend.

36
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,364
<i>You've reached the mobile number
of President Charles Logan.</i>

37
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,086
As a principal player in this

38
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,939
<i>unprecedented and historic
peace initiative,</i>

39
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:14,520
<i>Secretary of State Kanin's
untimely decision</i>

40
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:18,373
<i>to withdrew for health reasons
was a difficult one.</i>

41
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,141
<i>However,
the president wishes it to be known</i>

42
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:25,686
<i>that in Secretary Kanin's absence
and per his own recommendation,</i>

43
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:30,900
<i>she has sought and gained the counsel
of former President Charles Logan.</i>

44
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:33,986
<i>Now, the president</i>

45
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,615
<i>is acutely aware that this decision
bears some controversy.</i>

46
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:42,343
<i>But President Logan's experience
with foreign policy</i>

47
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:44,371
<i>and his skills in negotiation</i>

48
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,374
<i>have already proven to be
a great asset in these final hours</i>

49
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:49,788
<i>before the signing
of the peace agreement</i>

50
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>with the Islamic Republic.</i>

51
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,465
- <i>Once Mrs. Hassan...</i>
- Excuse me, Mr. President.

52
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,221
<i>... and the IRK delegation...</i>

53
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:58,773
Your car to the heliport
is ready and waiting downstairs.

54
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:01,090
Has President Suvarov's
plane arrived yet?

55
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,725
It should be soon touching down at JFK,
and then he'll be choppered in

56
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,501
to the 93rd Street Heliport

57
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,395
Thank you.
I'll be down in a moment.

58
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,274
<i>Once Mrs. Hassan</i>

59
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>and the IRK delegation
have hashed out a few remaining</i>

60
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,546
<i>points of protocol
with President Taylor,</i>

61
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:21,639
<i>the signing will commence
as scheduled.</i>

62
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,089
Tell me you have a lead on Bauer.

63
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:31,335
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

64
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:35,756
We tracked him to an adjacent building,
but he managed to get out of the cordon,

65
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,969
along with the reporter
Meredith Reed.

66
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,177
Also, he's killed Pavel.

67
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,514
I've taken jurisdictional control
over the scene from NYPD.

68
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:47,126
We should be able to keep
this contained, but it...

69
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:50,355
it's not gonna matter if Bauer's
already passed along the evidence

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,273
he got from Dana Walsh to the press.

71
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,981
- <i>The story's going to come out.</i>
- No, not necessarily.

72
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:58,153
We still might be able
to manage this.

73
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:01,240
I know you've told me that you're
committed to seeing this through,

74
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,369
but you can still extricate yourself.
There's no evidence against you yet.

75
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,664
- You can delay the press announcement.
- It's too late for that.

76
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,241
The White House Press Secretary just
announced my role in the peace process.

77
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:13,806
There is no turning back.

78
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,629
There's something else
you should know.

79
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,851
Bauer didn't just kill Pavel.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,259
He butchered him.

81
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,470
<i>He beat him savagely,
and then he eviscerated him.</i>

82
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,499
I don't think Bauer's just looking
to expose the Russians' involvement

83
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,309
in the plot against Hassan.

84
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,094
This guy's out for blood.

85
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,820
Then you better find him
and stop him, hadn't you?

86
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,112
Keep me posted.

87
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:48,746
I'm not going any further till you
tell me what happened back there.

88
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,712
- You killed that man, didn't you?
- Your life is in danger.

89
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,375
You want to get through this alive,

90
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,294
you're gonna do exactly what I say.

91
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,862
Do you understand?

92
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,674
I can't get a locate on the number
you called from this phone.

93
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,093
It's restricted.
I'm gonna have to route a back trace.

94
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:05,804
- Can you do it here?
- I need the equipment at my place.

95
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,260
Get back to me as soon
as you got a location. Let's go.

96
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:09,725
Who is it you're looking for?

97
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,363
Someone who can give me
the names of everyone else involved.

98
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:15,230
- And what are you gonna do then?
- It doesn't concern you.

99
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,524
How can I trust you
if you don't tell me what you're doing?

100
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,486
Because I'm not trying to kill you.

101
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,905
The video file that I gave you

102
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:26,594
is the only proof of the Russians' guilt
in President Hassan's assassination.

103
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,764
But the conspiracy doesn't end
with the Russians.

104
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,317
There are people in the government
trying to cover this up,

105
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:32,725
including President Taylor.

106
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,667
Why would the president want this?

107
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,814
Because she's trying to keep
the peace accord alive with the IRK.

108
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,802
And she knows if Dalia Hassan finds out
that the Russians killed her husband,

109
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,384
she'll never sign the agreement.

110
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,589
What do you want from me?

111
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,223
I need you to break the story
in case I don't make it.

112
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,018
I think President Hassan
deserves that.

113
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,605
Let me see your cell phone.

114
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,760
Wait.
What are you doing?

115
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,656
They've seen you with me.

116
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,701
The authorities are going to monitor
your usual forms of communication.

117
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,659
You can't go home
or back to your office.

118
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:11,463
Is there anyone that you work with
that you trust?

119
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,118
My editor, Gary Klausner.

120
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:16,887
You need to get him the evidence.
I can get you as far as a pay phone.

121
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,062
After that, you're on your own.

122
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,176
I'm glad we were able
to come to terms.

123
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,090
So am I.

124
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,217
Thank you,
for your patience with me.

125
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,138
I am still new to this.

126
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,222
You are a natural leader, Dalia,

127
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,007
and you have a superb
advisor in Minister Jamot.

128
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:34,190
I appreciate the endorsement,
Madam President.

129
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:35,227
Pardon me...

130
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,745
for interrupting.

131
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,149
We were just finishing up.

132
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:44,069
I'm honored to finally meet you.

133
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,196
I was a great admirer
of your husband.

134
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,656
I'm so sorry for you loss.

135
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:48,999
Thank you.

136
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:51,535
President Taylor tells me
you were instrumental

137
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,415
in convincing the Russian to stay
at the negotiating table.

138
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,083
I'm honored to play even a small part
in such an historic event.

139
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,048
May I have a few moments with you?

140
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,284
I'll see you at the signing.

141
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,103
You still haven't found out how Logan
convinced the Russians to stay?

142
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,897
I've investigated it,
but I learned nothing.

143
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,987
Our intelligence service
can look into it.

144
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:22,941
Thank you.

145
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,481
I trust President Taylor.

146
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:29,031
We have to assume that if she involved
Logan, it was for a good reason.

147
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,460
The operation to capture Bauer
was unsuccessful.

148
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:44,955
He got away, along with the evidence
that he took from Dana Walsh.

149
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,288
You said you had
the situation under control.

150
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,984
Clearly, I was overly optimistic.

151
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,025
And in my optimism,

152
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,558
I neglected to tell you that Bauer
made contact with a journalist.

153
00:07:57,116 --> 00:07:59,058
- Meredith Reed.
- My God...

154
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:01,188
You need to call her publisher
right away.

155
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,817
Deny any foreknowledge
of whatever evidence she has,

156
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,366
and demand
that they do not run the story.

157
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,850
You're suggesting
muzzling the press?

158
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:12,031
Have you forgotten
that freedom of the press

159
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,607
- is constitutionally protected?
- You are the president, for God's sake.

160
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,281
Invoke national security.

161
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,844
You tell them
this story will start a war.

162
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:23,339
- Innocent lives will be lost.
- New lies to cover the old ones.

163
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,914
The time has passed
for hand wringing.

164
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,436
If you don't use
the power of your office

165
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,186
to shut this story down,

166
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,766
your peace agreement

167
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,741
won't be the only casualty.

168
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:38,063
You don't need me
to tell you the damage

169
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,435
that your criminal prosecution
will do

170
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,833
to this country.

171
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,106
This country survived
your presidency.

172
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,964
But it won't survive yours.

173
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,784
Me...
I inherited my presidency.

174
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,904
I was never

175
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,675
nearly as popular as you are.

176
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:57,828
And most of my alleged misdeeds
never made the press.

177
00:08:58,756 --> 00:08:59,897
But if you...

178
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,622
were to bare your sins

179
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,440
to the people
who put you in office...

180
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:09,339
You are a beacon of righteousness,

181
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:12,690
not only for Americans,
but for the rest of the world

182
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,495
You... are the president

183
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:18,301
who had her own daughter arrested

184
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:21,004
rather than see justice go unserved.

185
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,429
You're a poison.

186
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,482
I never should have
let you to do this.

187
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,362
With due respect, Madam President,

188
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,599
I gave recommendations,

189
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:36,918
I made...

190
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,161
whatever arrangements
needed to be made.

191
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,254
But every decision was yours.

192
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,619
Let's not pretend otherwise.

193
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,322
I've studied you

194
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,409
for a number of years, Allison.

195
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:54,593
I pride myself on being
a good judge of character.

196
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,269
You're a smart woman.

197
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,619
You've always known
what needed to be done

198
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,098
and were willing to do it.

199
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,393
Which is why I know you will call
Meredith Reed's publisher

200
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,711
and make sure he kills the story.

201
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,581
I would suggest you do it now.

202
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,747
You have a signing ceremony
to prepare for.

203
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,050
And...

204
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:20,285
I need to go meet President Suvarov.

205
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,775
- You need to see this.
- What is it?

206
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,266
I just tapped into a live feed
from Pillar's team.

207
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,905
This guy was found sliced open

208
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,851
in an abandoned building
across from the department store.

209
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:51,149
He's got Russian papers, but I can't
make 'em out, the rez is too low.

210
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,695
Looks like someone left a sniper rifle
at the scene.

211
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,530
What's the caliber?
Bring it up.

212
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:59,628
They tagged it as a 308 Springfield.

213
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:04,955
That's the gun that killed Renee.
That's got to be the shooter.

214
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,749
Jack did this, and you still think
you're gonna be able

215
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,668
- to talk him down?
- I gotta try.

216
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,339
Pillar are just gonna kill him,
I can't let that happen.

217
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:18,635
Got a match from the department store
security feed: 82%.

218
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,057
- That's the guy helping Jack?
- James Ricker.

219
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,761
Ex-Green Beret, Special Ops.

220
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:26,759
He served with Jack in the Gulf
before Jack was enlisted by CTU.

221
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,687
Just one problem.
He's dead.

222
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,733
It says he died in a chemical plant
explosion in Basra 7 years ago.

223
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,162
Then he must have a twin who was there
when Jack reversed the ambush.

224
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,037
You better go back to your station.
Pillar's watchdog is getting suspicious.

225
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,986
Cross-reference Ricker's photo
with State DMV database.

226
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:52,961
He must be living under an alias.
We find him, we find Jack.

227
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,220


228
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,893
- You get the location?
- <i>You didn't tell me that was</i>

229
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,684
- Logan's phone that I was tracing.
- Does it matter?

230
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,645
Yeah, it kind of does.
I think you know it, too,

231
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,249
or else you would've been
straight with me.

232
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,901
Taking out a bunch of Russian spooks
is one thing,

233
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,173
moving on an ex-president,
that's quite another.

234
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:20,322
That's a seriously line
you're crossing there.

235
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,575
I know what I'm doing. Are you gonna
give me the location or not?

236
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:29,664
Logan's in a vehicle.
He's moving west from the U.N.

237
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,568
I'm syncing up with the Secret Service
deployment grid.

238
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,545
- I'll upload his route to your tablet.
- Hold on.

239
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:41,760
Okay, I've got it.

240
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,745
<i>I sure hope
you know what you're doing,</i>

241
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,807
because this path you're on,
there ain't no coming back from it.

242
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,609
I wasn't planning on coming back.

243
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,684
You're right, you've already done
more than I had a right to ask for.

244
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,981
I want you to erase
all your connections to me.

245
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,593
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye.

246
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:45,115
That's all you need?
Should I call the doctor?

247
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,716
It's just a headache. I'm fine.

248
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,418
You wanted to see me?

249
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,966
Please sit down.

250
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:01,421
You remember the reporter
CTU arrested last night?

251
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:02,841


252
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:06,418
It has been brought to my attention
that she intends to publish

253
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:09,221
an unfounded story
regarding Omar Hassan's murder.

254
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:12,803
What is she gonna be writing?

255
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,855
I need you to contact the FBI,

256
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,973
have them search
the <i>Sunday Magazine</i> offices,

257
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,210
locate Reed,

258
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,446
and seize whatever evidence
she purports to have.

259
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,324
I don't understand.

260
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,861
Her allegations are false,
but the allegations alone

261
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,495
could derail the peace process.

262
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,998
Even so, you have to be aware,
they'll accuse you of censore.

263
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,963
Tim, I did not ask for your counsel.

264
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,189
I know exactly
what I'm ordering you to do,

265
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,864
so please just do it.

266
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,303
Hey, drop-off and receiving?

267
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,667
Straight ahead. Right there.

268
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,629
Just make sure Duggan knows
he's covering the Logan profile.

269
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:48,256
Tell him we'll work out
the byline later.

270
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:53,444
- Editor's desk. This is Klausner.
- <i>Gary, it's me.</i>

271
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,911
Look, are you alone?
Can you speak freely?

272
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,374
What's going on?

273
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,959
I don't have a lot of time,
I have a lead on a story.

274
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:04,400
- I'm listening.
- I have a digital video recording

275
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:07,090
indicating that the IRK
terrorists who killed Hassan

276
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,676
were being funded and run
by Russian operatives.

277
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,721
You sure it's legit?

278
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,479
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

279
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:16,057
From Jack Bauer.

280
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,475
The man's a fugitive.

281
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:20,895
It's really not safe for me to talk.

282
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,547
I'll explain more when I see you.
Can you meet me?

283
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:24,690
Sure, of course.

284
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,759
All right, that diner
with the coffee you hate.

285
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,280
I can be there in 15 minutes.

286
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:32,823
And, Gary, don't tell anyone.

287
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:33,944
<i>All right?</i>

288
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,908
I got it.

289
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:37,346
<i>Be safe.</i>

290
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:38,913
You, too.

291
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,149
There's no need to panic.

292
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,403
<i>Do you know what he did to Pavel?</i>

293
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:13,449
He was beaten savagely,
gutted like a pig.

294
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,658
His men shot dead.

295
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:18,413
I'm sorry to hear that,
but we both knew that...

296
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,623
Bauer would be
a difficult problem to solve.

297
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:25,092
You know what he's doing, don't you?
He's eliminating everyone involved,

298
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:27,531
working his way up...
how long before he gets to me?

299
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:30,195
- That's not going to happen.
- How can you be so sure?

300
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,466
Because you told me yourself

301
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,466
your man would never talk,
and if that's true, then...

302
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:39,157
nobody outside of your inner circle
can point the finger at you.

303
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:41,309
I promise you...

304
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:44,183
Bauer's never going to know.

305
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,692
And on the upside,
his recent activities

306
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,777
have given us a bit of an advantage.

307
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:53,029
What advantage?

308
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:56,533
CTU orders concerning him
have been upgraded

309
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,158
to "shoot on sight".

310
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:01,079
First you have to find him.

311
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,349
They're going to find him,
don't worry.

312
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,959
He can't stay
under the radar forever.

313
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:09,337
<i>I'll keep you posted.</i>

314
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,783
Come in! We're under assault!
We are trapped

315
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,326
in the 4th Street underpass.

316
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,818
Unit LEZ-1, requesting
immediate backup.

317
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,875
Both entrances are blocked.
We are boxed in.

318
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,671
That's Jack Bauer.
That's got to be.

319
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,132
Did you hear what I said?

320
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,701
That's Jack Bauer!

321
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,305
Don't just sit there!
He's coming for me!

322
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:05,645
Stay in the vehicle. We're armored
and the glass is bulletproof.

323
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,663
The assailant is masked.
It may be Jack Bauer.

324
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,716
- Close the door! Secure the vehicle!
- Close the door!

325
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,069
Stay down, Mr. President.

326
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:55,300
Kill him!

327
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:54,451
Get up,
or I will kill you right here.

328
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:55,576
Move!

329
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:23,114
I got your flash.
What'd you find out about Ricker?

330
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:24,429
You were right.

331
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:26,826
DMV records show Ricker
living in Suffolk County

332
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,820
under the name Simon Strocker.

333
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:31,193
I tried to confirm,
found out he moved from there,

334
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:33,666
but he left a forwarding address
with the postal service.

335
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,542
It's right here in Soho.

336
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,088
Devon, what's going on?

337
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:41,998
Pillar's people are requesting
backup for the team in the field.

338
00:21:42,123 --> 00:21:43,714
- Why?
- You didn't hear?

339
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,201
Jack Bauer just kidnapped
Charles Logan.

340
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,768
How the hell did he pull that off?
Charles Logan?

341
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,593
I need to hear what's going on
in that room. Follow me.

342
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,218
- How far out are you?
- We're approaching the tunnel now.

343
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:10,326
How the hell did
Secret Service let this happen?

344
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,121
Bauer hit the town car
with tear gas.

345
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,156
The agents were too incapacitated
to pursue.

346
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:16,947
PD's got the tunnel locked down.
I'm working on getting you schematics.

347
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:18,072
Hurry up.

348
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:27,025
CTU! Make a hole!

349
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:42,902
Where did Bauer
take President Logan?

350
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:44,237
I don't know.

351
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,606
You must have seen something.

352
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:51,411
Tell me you saw something.

353
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,061
- Sorry, sir.
- Nothing?

354
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,686
No one saw anything.

355
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:09,137
They went through a service gate.

356
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,514
- I need those schematics.
- Sending them to you now.

357
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Go.

358
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,901
Kirsch, take the corridor.
Brown, you're down there.

359
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,685
<i>Ames, you're with me. Remember,
unless it poses a threat</i>

360
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,628
<i>to President Logan, you shoot Bauer
on sight, and you shoot to kill.</i>

361
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:30,992
<i>Let's go.</i>

362
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:37,104
Through here.

363
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:45,548
Look at me.
I said look at me!

364
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:47,592
You're going to tell me
everything I want.

365
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,427
Jack, you're making a mistake.

366
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,566
Don't you pretend
you're not a part of this.

367
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,841
I found the man
who killed Renee Walker:

368
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,893
the Russian operative Pavel Tokarev.
I got his cell phone.

369
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,064
- The last call he got was from you.
- You got to let me explain.

370
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:00,938
What?

371
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,982
That you sent for him to kill me?

372
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:06,360
- You sent him to kill me, right?
- Yes! Damn it, yes!

373
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,112
Why did you kill Renee Walker?

374
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,449
I had nothing to do with that.
I was brought in after that happened.

375
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,243
- Who brought you in?
- The president needed my help

376
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,538
to bring the Russians back to the table.
I called my sources in Moscow.

377
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:19,499
They told me that people
in their government

378
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,542
were behind Hassan's assassination.

379
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,045
I told the Russian delegation
I had evidence of that fact

380
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,536
and all the names.
It was to keep them at the conference.

381
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:27,799
What evidence?

382
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,317
It doesn't exist.

383
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,844
I was playing poker.
It was a bluff. It worked.

384
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,222
It kept Taylor's peace agreement
on the table, but...

385
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,890
You were determined
to screw things up.

386
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:43,648
I admit, I was part of the cover-up, but
I'm not part of the Russian conspiracy.

387
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,942
I had nothing to do
with the terrorist attack

388
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,760
or your friend's death.

389
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:50,321
I'm not the bad guy here.

390
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:52,323
Okay, but you know who is.

391
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,659
You know the name
of the Russian person

392
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,327
giving the orders. I want it.

393
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,287
Give me the name!

394
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,415
You got five seconds
before I put a bullet through your head.

395
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,377
- Five... Four... three...
- I'll tell you. Mikhail Novakovich.

396
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,337
He's the head of the delegation.

397
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,216
He's been trying to kill
the peace treaty from the start.

398
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,011
- You're lying.
- No! No! I'm not lying to you!

399
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,973
You got my call from Pavel's phone.
You check the previous calls.

400
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:20,017
There's a dozen more from Novakovich.
I'm telling you.

401
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,145
- He's the one you want.
- Shut up!

402
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:25,141
Say another word,
and I'll drop you right here.

403
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:40,633
- Get on your knees.
- Oh, no. Please.

404
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:41,873
Don't kill me.

405
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,959
If I was gonna kill you,
you'd already be dead.

406
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,606
Bauer was just here... find him!

407
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,333
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

408
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,570
I need a med unit
at the 49th junction.

409
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:30,901
On its way.
Is it Bauer?

410
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,295
No. It's the president.

411
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,550
He's unconscious.

412
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,983
Bauer escaped. I'm gonna need you
to redirect the pursuit.

413
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:39,555
- I'll stay with the president.
- Understood.

414
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,229
They still might catch up to him.

415
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:45,251
They haven't yet.
Do you have Ricker's file?

416
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,021
Yeah, including his current address.

417
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,989
I'm sending it to you now.

418
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:50,898
What are your plans?

419
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:54,362
We can't send any tactical units
without Pillar finding out about it.

420
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:57,281
- I'm not using any of them.
- Then who are you going to get?

421
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:00,826
All of our agents are fully deployed
in the field. There's nobody to send.

422
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:02,649
There's one.

423
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,250
I saw the flash from division.
They approved your request

424
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,135
to release Agent Ortiz
into your custody?

425
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,613
- I'm in a hurry, so...
- What do you think you're doing?

426
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:33,520
He's a non-cooperative witness
who is facing federal charges.

427
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:36,247
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm still in charge of UN Security,

428
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:39,295
and you've taken away all my resources.
Not that it's any of your business,

429
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,341
but Agent Ortiz designed
the entire UN operation.

430
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:45,830
The signing is in less than two hours.
His assistance in the field is vital.

431
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,207
I'm going to have to clear this
with Pillar.

432
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,379
Do what you want, but you have bigger
problems, like not finding Jack Bauer.

433
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:17,965
Are you Meredith?

434
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,074
There's a Gary Klausner
on the phone for you.

435
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,656
It's up by the cashier.

436
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:24,781
Thank you.

437
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:31,556
Thanks.

438
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,587
Where are you?

439
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,841
The FBI is here.
Showed up before I could leave.

440
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,593
They're looking for you,

441
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,797
<i>including me.</i>

442
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,638
- You didn't tell them anything?
- <i>Of course not.</i>

443
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,186
But they've got an executive order
from the president.

444
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,060
They say you're in possession
of materials

445
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,816
- that pose a national security risk.
- It's a cover-up.

446
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:54,076
The White House is trying
to suppress the story.

447
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,274
You can't let them.

448
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,862
Until we clear this up,
you have to protect that evidence.

449
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:02,433
I told them
I'm not in contact with you,

450
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,116
but they're tracing this call.

451
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,821
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

452
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:07,370
And go where?

453
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,371
Mr. Klausner.

454
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,374
No communication
outside of our presence.

455
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,043
I'm canceling an appointment.

456
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,296
- They're going to bury the truth.
- <i>Not if I can help it.</i>

457
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,299
I'll try to put a call in
to Ed Sampson at the Justice Department,

458
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,637
<i>but, until then, lay low.
Now go.</i>

459
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:48,285
Let's go.

460
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,746
- Where are we going?
- I have to go to the UN,

461
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,998
and division has given you
a temporary furlough.

462
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,167
Since you had earlier
command of UN security,

463
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,546
I need your help coordinating protocols
for the signing ceremony.

464
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:00,840
Pillar's okay with this?

465
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,211
I'm still provisional
Director of Operations.

466
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:04,579
I don't need his consent.

467
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,554
Would you rather

468
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,620
wait here
for your federal prosecution?

469
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:09,675
Let's go.

470
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,343
I'll take him from here.

471
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,380
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

472
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:25,239
You were right about Jack.
He is working with somebody.

473
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,076
James Ricker,

474
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,411
ex-CIA Op.

475
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:34,290
He lives at a place on Mercer Street
under the alias Simon Strocker.

476
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,668
- Maybe he's still with the CIA.
- No, he was listed as deceased.

477
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,212
More than likely,
he's gone into business for himself,

478
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,424
dealing arms or intel.
In any case, he's not going to be happy.

479
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,552
Wait a second.
Why are you telling me this?

480
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:49,889
I need you to talk to him.
Get him to tell us where Jack is.

481
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,392
Are you good with that, or not?

482
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,061
I want to expose this cover-up
as much as you. I'm in.

483
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,937
Good. Log sheets

484
00:30:58,062 --> 00:30:59,901
will show you
accompanying me to the UN.

485
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,109
I've secured you a separate vehicle.

486
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,622
Is there any more intel on Jack?
Has he resurfaced again?

487
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:07,323
Yeah, you could say that.

488
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,166
I just received word.

489
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,330
President Suvarov's plane
has touched down.

490
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,199
Tell Ivan to bring the car.

491
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:19,502
I want to be at the UN
when the president arrives.

492
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:48,709
Where's Novakovich?

493
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:51,283
- I'm not going to ask you again.
- 11th.

494
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,869
- 11th floor, suite 1170.
- How do I get up there?

495
00:31:54,402 --> 00:31:55,847
Secure elevator inside of garage.

496
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:57,623
- Where's your keycard?
- I don't have.

497
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,490
- Where is your keycard?
- I don't have one, I swear.

498
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,617
His personal guards have them
at elevator.

499
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:06,822
- How many?
- Two.

500
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:07,883
And upstairs?

501
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,761
One outside the suite, two inside.
Another by elevator.

502
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,929
Where else?

503
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,848
- Where else?
- That's all I know.

504
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:39,975
Do you really need an arsenal?

505
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,805
Better to have it than to not.

506
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,979
Besides, Ricker's a trained killer.

507
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,227
He's gone to a lot of trouble
to stay off the grid.

508
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:47,149
Okay.

509
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:50,486
I also have to consider the possibility
that Jack's with him.

510
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:52,946
Listen, Chloe,

511
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,408
I can't be worried about Jack,
not after what you told me he did.

512
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,911
Obviously, Logan's
part of the conspiracy.

513
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,704
He terrorized a tunnel
full of peoples

514
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,247
with automatic weapon fire.

515
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,041
He shot Secret Service agents.

516
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:06,710
He shot to wound.

517
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,630
He's careless,
and he only cares about revenge.

518
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,799
Does that sound like
the man you know?

519
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,425
The man you're trying to save?

520
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,784
This is about exposing
the Russians' cover-up.

521
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,972
Not about Jack.

522
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,058
Are you sure about that?

523
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,880
Because if Jack's there,

524
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,755
and he makes any move
other than complete surrender...

525
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:28,732
I'm putting him down.

526
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,652
You still okay?

527
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:34,113
I don't have a choice.

528
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:39,159
Whatever happens,
call me at the U.N.

529
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,470
You got it.

530
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,095
You'll approach the rostrum

531
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,508
prior to the signing ceremony,
and take a seat here

532
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,000
in position three,
next to your mother.

533
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,225
I'm honored.

534
00:34:58,633 --> 00:34:59,888
But is that appropriate?

535
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:01,765
I may be her daughter,

536
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,101
but I don't have any
official role in government.

537
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:08,931
Excuse me.

538
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:11,759
Ms. Hassan, there's a call
on your father's secure line...

539
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:13,569
a woman wants to speak
with your mother.

540
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,903
She's in a meeting.

541
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,638
That's what I said,
but this woman is quite insistent.

542
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:19,536
- Who is she?
- She won't say.

543
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,327
We're done, Ms. Hassan.
I'll see you in the staging area.

544
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,495
Thank you.

545
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:24,953
Line two.

546
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,708
Hello. Who is this?

547
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:30,502
Is this Kayla?

548
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:32,852
- Who are you?
- Sorry...

549
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:35,090
I am Meredith Reed.

550
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:37,202
<i>I need to speak to your mother.</i>

551
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:38,969
I know who you are.

552
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,729
Why are you calling here?

553
00:35:40,854 --> 00:35:43,910
I know I'm the last person that either
of you wants to talk to right now...

554
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:46,143
You're right.
I'm hanging up now.

555
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,229
No, please, your mother needs to hear
what I have to say

556
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,106
before she signs the agreement.

557
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:55,068
What is it that is so important?

558
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:57,923
I'm sorry, I need to speak
to your mother directly.

559
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:00,324
Haven't you caused
my mother enough pain?

560
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:02,254
Leave us alone!

561
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:04,661
It's about the people
who really murdered your father.

562
00:36:06,722 --> 00:36:08,572
What are you talking about?

563
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:10,334
We know who was responsible.

564
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,961
What you don't know is,
those people were working

565
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,012
under the orders of Russian agents.

566
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:17,007
What?

567
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,679
<i>Hello?</i>

568
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:25,167
When your mother gets back,
have her call me at this number.

569
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,727
Can you take this down?

570
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:30,979
Go ahead.

571
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,330
It's 212-555-0121.

572
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:38,195
- I'll explain everything to her then.
- Wait!

573
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,788
Meredith Reed?

574
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,146
FBI. Get your hands
where we can see 'em.

575
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:52,229
What is this?
What is this?

576
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,332
You have no right to take that.

577
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,382
I haven't done anything wrong.
What is this?

578
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,640
- You're under arrest.
- I've done nothing wrong.

579
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,465
I've done nothing wrong!

580
00:37:19,257 --> 00:37:20,972
- Yes?
- Mr. Woods, ma'am.

581
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:27,186
I've just received word
from the FBI.

582
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,370
Reed is in custody,

583
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,622
and they've secured
a data card they found on her.

584
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,703
No one sees what's on it but me.

585
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,097
Understood.

586
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,603
- We'll take it from here.
- I'm riding with him to the hospital.

587
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:55,877
Give him some space.

588
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,028
Nova...

589
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,071
Novakovich.

590
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:07,261
Bauer knows.

591
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,495
Warn Novakovich
Bauer's coming after him.

592
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:12,915
- We gotta get going.
- Not yet.

593
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,396
Just do what you can for him here.
Understood.

594
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:52,686
Mr. Novakovich?

595
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,373
<i>Hello?</i>

596
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:58,043
It's Berkov.
We've been attacked.

597
00:38:58,543 --> 00:38:59,693
It was Bauer.

598
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:03,362
- Where's Novakovich?
- He's dead.

599
00:39:04,205 --> 00:39:05,486
Everyone is dead.

600
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,556
Berkov, did Novakovich
say anything to Bauer?

601
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:13,976
I need an ambulance.

602
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,614
Just answer my question.

603
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,312
What did Novakovich say to Bauer?

604
00:39:17,628 --> 00:39:19,731
Nothing.
Bauer just came in shooting.

605
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:22,306
But he was bleeding.

606
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:24,403
I think he was wounded
by one of the guards.

607
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:27,823
Sit tight,
an ambulance is on the way.

608
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:32,558
Go.

609
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:36,289
Novakovich is dead.

610
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,324
Bauer killed him,
killed all of his men...

611
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:42,192
I don't know
if Novakovich said anything to Bauer.

612
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:11,742
- Yes?
- <i>Yuri?</i>

613
00:40:12,398 --> 00:40:13,493
Charles Logan.

614
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:17,205
I thought you were going to be
at the heliport for my arrival.

615
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,473
Yes, well...

616
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,384
I ran into some trouble.

617
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:23,712
I'm afraid I have bad news.

618
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:28,720
It appears that Mikhail Novakovich
was just murdered by Jack Bauer.

619
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:29,688
What?

620
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:33,472
Jack Bauer learned
that Novakovich was responsible

621
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,052
for ordering and...

622
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:38,685
coordinating
Omar Hassan's assassination,

623
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,121
<i>as well as the rest
of Samir's activities.</i>

624
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:42,773
Where would he get that idea?

625
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:43,941
From me.

626
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:47,569
The lunatic was gonna kill me, Yuri.
What can I say?

627
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:49,242
Think of it as...

628
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:51,645
sacrificing a rook for a king.

629
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:54,159
Then Bauer has no idea

630
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,974
that Novakovich was operating
under my orders?

631
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:57,954
<i>None.</i>

632
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,415
According to a witness,

633
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,877
Mikhail didn't have a chance
to give you up, even he wanted to.

634
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,672
As far as Bauer is concerned...

635
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,439
the trail ended with Novakovich.

636
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:14,096
And he's being hunted by every
law enforcement agency in the city.

637
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:16,145
And I've heard that...

638
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,433
he's been wounded.

639
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:22,104
There is nothing more dangerous
than a wounded animal.

640
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,524
If you're so worried about Bauer,
you never should have given the order

641
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,900
to kill Renee Walker.

642
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,572
<i>That's what stirred up
the hornet's nest.</i>

643
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:34,210
If I had known that you were going
to find out about our activities

644
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:36,451
and use that information
to blackmail me

645
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,627
into signing
Taylor's peace agreement,

646
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:41,053
I wouldn't have bothered
with the woman.

647
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:42,833
Water under the bridge, Yuri.

648
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:46,223
I needed an opportunity
to put myself back in the game.

649
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:49,172
I'm sorry that it has come
at your expense.

650
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:51,850
You wouldn't begrudge an old friend

651
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,069
his second chance in the sun.

652
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,467
<i>All right, then, I will...</i>

653
00:41:57,592 --> 00:42:00,013
<i>I will meet you
at the United Nations...</i>

654
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,795
<i>as soon as I can.</i>
