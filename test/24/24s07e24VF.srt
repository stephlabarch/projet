00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:16,515
Before his death,
Jonas Hodges told us

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,640
that there were other parties
involved with him

5
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,608
in the creation of this bioweapon

6
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,605
The FBI has apprehended

7
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:25,900
Tony Almeida.
He is a key figure in this plot.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,445
Jonas Hodges was killed
outside FBI headquarters.

9
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:31,072
Ms. Taylor might be involved.

10
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:33,658
Olivia is capable of many things,

11
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,997
but I can't believe
committing murder is one of them.

12
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,245
I need you to access
the digital recording system.

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,040
To see if their conversation
was recorded.

14
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,211
What I can't live with
is that monster getting away with this.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,588
My operatives
are with your daughter.

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,997
In fact,
I'm looking at her right now.

17
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:51,676
You will help Tony Almeida escape

18
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,880
<i>or my people will murder
your daughter.</i>

19
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,354
- Don't move!
- Jack, why?

20
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:00,184
The people that are working with Tony
have operatives with Kim right now.

21
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,728
They threatened to kill her
if I don't break him out.

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,312
The people who are watching you
are our only lead to finding your father

23
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:15,199
That laptop has the camera
they were using to track me.

24
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,326
We may be able to back trace
to my father.

25
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:20,405
Your people are gonna be able
to launch the biological attacks,

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,077
just as they originally planned.

27
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:23,031
How?

28
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:25,418
We have Jack.
The pathogen's in his organs.

29
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,753
We'll be able to harvest
what we need from his body.

30
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:29,755
Tony believes in what we're doing.

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,872
Are you suggesting I meet with him?

32
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:35,052
I'll look Almeida in the eye,

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,139
and if, for any reason,
I don't like what I see,

34
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,182
I can't let him walk
out of that meeting alive.

35
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,174
- How much longer does he have?
- A couple of hours, give or take.

36
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,522
The pathogen could survive
up to two hours after death.

37
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,311
The only sure way to destroy it

38
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:51,569
is by exposure to extreme temperatures
above 500-degrees Celsius.

39
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,154
Get him ready to move.

40
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:20,027
Tell me if you need more people,
I will get them for you.

41
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:21,918
We don't need people
but to get lucky.

42
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:25,027
The transmitter node on the laptop
is encrypted with multiple relays.

43
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:28,230
- Can you source the transmission?
- I'm trying with a work-around.

44
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:30,483
Call me as soon as
you have something.

45
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,508
- They can't source the transmission?
- They're working on it.

46
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,479
Chloe and Janis are doing
everything they can.

47
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:38,083
Is there no other lead,
no other way to find my father?

48
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,409
This is a good lead.
We have it 'cause of you.

49
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,599
Yeah, except my father's dying.

50
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,955
And we don't know
how much time he has left.

51
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:36,938
Come in.

52
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,656
What are you still doing here?

53
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,729
Just finishing up
the conversation we started.

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,125
I told you to escort Ethan
to the gate.

55
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:55,779
Take him out of my office
and off the White House grounds.

56
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:56,904
No, ma'am,

57
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,335
I am not gonna do that.

58
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:01,816
I'm calling security.

59
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,275
<i>Having me dig up dirt
on Noah Daniels is one thing.</i>

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,150
<i>- This is a whole different animal.
- I'm aware of that, Martin.</i>

61
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:16,371
<i>I want this to happen.
I want this person taken care of.</i>

62
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,410
<i>It's Jonas Hodges.</i>

63
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:27,076
The digital card
you confiscated from me was blank.

64
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,499
I gave the real one to Agent Pierce.

65
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,710
How long have you known, Aaron?

66
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,250
I had my suspicions, ma'am,

67
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,659
but I was hoping I was wrong.

68
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,112
I'll wait outside, Sir.

69
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:59,832
- This doesn't tell the whole story.
- Sounds pretty clear to me.

70
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,574
Hodges is dead, you're responsible.

71
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,406
I know, but I tried
to stop it from happening.

72
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:07,282
Save it, Olivia!

73
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,662
You can't talk your way
out of this situation, not this time.

74
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:16,878
All right, Ethan...

75
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:19,545
You win.

76
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:21,976
I'll resign.

77
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,019
Come up with some excuse.
You could have your job again.

78
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,929
- Everything will go...
- This isn't about getting my job back!

79
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,748
It's about the truth!

80
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:34,435
The truth could destroy
my mother's administration.

81
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:38,605
I am fully aware of the implications
if this goes public.

82
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,820
You don't have
to spell them out for me.

83
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,736
Then what do you want?

84
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:50,942
For the president
to take the next step.

85
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,456
Whether she decides to prosecute this
or bury it, that's her call.

86
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:59,251
But she needs to know the truth.

87
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,086
I'll let you tell her yourself.

88
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,106
I can't believe you're doing this.

89
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,851
You're betraying everything
that you've ever worked for.

90
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,027
You think this country failed you,

91
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:20,689
I don't care what kind of ideology
you believe in now.

92
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,360
This is no way to fight for it.

93
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:24,902
What you're doing is wrong.
This is wrong, and you know it!

94
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,322
Damn it, Tony, look at me!

95
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:34,785
Please...

96
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:38,635
As someone
who was once your friend...

97
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,285
Let me die in peace.

98
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:45,297
Don't let them use me
to kill innocent people.

99
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,490
I have no intention of letting them
use you as a pathogen, Jack.

100
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,520
- I never did.
- I overheard you.

101
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,975
This was your idea.
You sold it to them.

102
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,019
It was just a play.

103
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
A play?

104
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,565
To get the man
who's coming here right now.

105
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,710
Took me three years to find him.

106
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:11,031
Took me another year
to get him to meet me face-to-face.

107
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:15,911
I had to prove myself to him
by taking down Jonas Hodges.

108
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,938
I had to convince him
that I was a true believer in his cause.

109
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,542
What are you talking about?

110
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:24,902
His name...

111
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:26,982
is Alan Wilson.

112
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,866
He was the man behind Charles Logan.

113
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:33,570
He's the one who ordered
the hit on David Palmer,

114
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,195
He had Michelle killed
to cover his tracks.

115
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,505
This is the man
who murdered my wife, Jack

116
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:42,600
Everything that you've done today
is for personal revenge?

117
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:44,696
- It's about justice.
- Justice.

118
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,220
You killed innocent people, Tony!

119
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:51,588
Ten times as many people would have died
if it hadn't been for me.

120
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,824
The deeper I dug to find the person
responsible for Michelle's death,

121
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,787
the more I kept running
into men like Jonas Hodges.

122
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,790
They're the ones with
the crazy ideology, not me.

123
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,917
I'm the one who had a plan
to bring them down.

124
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:07,629
I'd enlisted Bill and Chloe to help me
track all the elements of this group.

125
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,376
And when I finally got
what I wanted,

126
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,702
they would turn them in
and shut them down.

127
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,181
You screwed that all up,
didn't you, Jack?

128
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:19,178
You see...

129
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:23,346
I'm the one who saved lives today, Jack.
Not you.

130
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,650
I'm the one who helped you
recover the CIP device,

131
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,928
who warned you
about the White House attacks,

132
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:32,078
I'm the one who stopped Jonas Hodges
from launching those missiles!

133
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:34,308
You tell yourself whatever you want.

134
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,180
You launched a biological attack
on Washington Center Station,

135
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:38,794
If we hadn't gotten there in time,

136
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,996
thousands of innocent people
would have been killed!

137
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,030
I did what I had to do
to get Alan Wilson there.

138
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:46,747
And now...

139
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,213
he's gonna die.

140
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,174
You kill him,

141
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:56,064
and no one will ever know
the full extent of this conspiracy.

142
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,849
I'm not gonna kill him, Jack...

143
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:05,896
You are.

144
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,819
Damn you, Tony.

145
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,202
Damn you.

146
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,081
I'm sorry that it has to be you.

147
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,161
The truth is they wouldn't let me
within 50 feet of the guy.

148
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:24,706
You're the one he's coming for.

149
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:27,882
You're not honoring Michelle's life.

150
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,859
You are reveling in her death,
and she would despise you for this.

151
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,537
We're clear.

152
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,181
- When's Wilson coming?
- Soon.

153
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:09,413
He wants to see
Bauer's medical record.

154
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,002
It's right over there.

155
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,988


156
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:42,626
Wilson doesn't know about us.

157
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:45,733
And it's best to keep it that way,
at least for now.

158
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,707
Sure.

159
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:51,908
I understand.

160
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:56,526
He's here.

161
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:02,244
Ready?

162
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,028
Let's go.

163
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:07,206
Put your hands behind your head.

164
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,805
<i>We're all clear.</i>

165
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:53,685
Go ahead.

166
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,148
That's far enough for you.

167
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:10,704
This is Tony Almeida.

168
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:13,769
- I've been looking forward to this.
- Yes, I know.

169
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:17,115
Where's Bauer?

170
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,848
Right inside.
Second door on the right.

171
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:22,613
Need this.

172
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:30,853
So, Cara...

173
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:35,207
thinks you should be playing
a larger role in our organization.

174
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:38,001
- You've been an asset.
- Thank you, sir.

175
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:42,047
But I believe there's a lot more
I can bring to the table.

176
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,556
But first, I want to see
Bauer's pathology report.

177
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,013
I have it right here.

178
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,383
<i>This is the FBI!
You're surrounded!</i>

179
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,018
<i>- Lay down your weapons!</i>
- Fire at will!

180
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:07,219
<i>I repeat, lay down your weapons!</i>

181
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:30,220
Set us down!

182
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,989
I need you to get me
to that green van! Go!

183
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:35,484
Stay away from me, I'm wired with C4.
Tony's got the detonator.

184
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,828
Stay away!

185
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,775
Wait, I know this trigger mechanism.
I can disarm it.

186
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,974
Where's Kim?

187
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,149
She's safe.

188
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,193
She's the reason
we were able to find you.

189
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:49,094
Tony's been playing both sides
all along. You need to stop him.

190
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:51,675
He's trying to kill the man
who's behind this conspiracy.

191
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,225
His name is Alan Wilson.

192
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,612
He was responsible
for killing Tony's wife Michelle.

193
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:59,053
That's why he's doing this.
You want to end this for good,

194
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:01,174
you need to stop Tony
from killing him.

195
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,408
Otherwise, you're gonna lose any chance
of exposing the others.

196
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:05,439
You're clear.

197
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Let's go!

198
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:19,603
Woodside Industrial Complex.

199
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:22,348
We're at the southeast quadrant
on our way to the perimeter.

200
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,854
Call me when you have
an exfiltration point.

201
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,651
How did this happen?

202
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:30,044
- How did they track us?
- I don't know.

203
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:43,139
Thank God you're okay.

204
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:45,688
The extraction team will be here soon
but we gotta move.

205
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:08,774
It took me a long time to find you.

206
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:13,425
To peel back all the layers of people
you hide behind.

207
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,353
But I stayed patient.

208
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:22,146
Because ever since the day
you had her killed,

209
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,336
the only thing that kept me alive

210
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,397
was this moment right here.

211
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,545
You sound like you were involved
in some kind of a tragedy

212
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,383
but I had nothing to do with it.

213
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:43,163
See, Michelle and me

214
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,081
had gotten out of all this.

215
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,990
We made it out together.

216
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,930
And we were gonna start
a whole new life.

217
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,080
Until you came along

218
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,172
and took it all away

219
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,038
in a split second.

220
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,161
It wasn't just my wife you murdered.

221
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,357
She was carrying my son.

222
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:25,995
You killed my son!

223
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:27,248
My son!

224
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,026
And now,

225
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,259
I'm gonna kill you.

226
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,346
Tony, don't move!

227
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,659
Tony, don't move!

228
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:02,046
Get him out of here.

229
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:12,236
These people think they can take
everything away from us, Jack!

230
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,671
Somebody had to stop them!
And what'd you do?

231
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,589
You ran away!

232
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,508
That's right, you ran away, Jack!

233
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:20,677
You're one of them now!

234
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,137
Congratulations!

235
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:25,180
How would Teri
feel about that, Jack?

236
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,080
You lost your nerve!

237
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:32,063
You're a coward, Jack!

238
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,088


239
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,500
A lot of people died today
because of you.

240
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:19,152
Including someone close to me.

241
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,005
You will be charged with treason

242
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,743
and conspiracy to launch
terrorist attacks against this country.

243
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,246
The only way that I see you avoiding
the death penalty is by cooperating.

244
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,119
Tell me who else is involved
in this conspiracy,

245
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,420
and I'll make sure

246
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,836
that your cooperation
is taken into account by the grand jury.

247
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,012
How can I cooperate if I have no idea
what you're talking about?

248
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,641
It's not gonna work, Wilson.

249
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,482
Whatever this conspiracy is

250
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:56,272
that you think that I'm a part of,
I guarantee

251
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,635
you won't find a shred of material
evidence connecting me to it.

252
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,062
In the eyes of the law,

253
00:22:04,527 --> 00:22:06,532
- I'm an innocent man.
- You son of a bitch!

254
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:09,971
Anything else you need to say,

255
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,596
- you can say to my attorneys.
- Ma'am.

256
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,124
They're almost ready to take Bauer
to the hospital.

257
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:16,575
You wanted a heads up.

258
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,271
I give you Hydromorphone
to make the ride easier.

259
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:33,482
It'll make you sleepy,
but it'll break the pain.

260
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:34,707
No, not yet.

261
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,310
Please.

262
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:48,150
- Could you give us a moment?
- Dr. Macer wants you at the hospital.

263
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:49,871
It's all right, she can wait.

264
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,793
What happened?

265
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:00,795
He's denying everything.

266
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:03,589
Claims that we don't have a case
against him.

267
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:06,054
Is he right?

268
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:07,714
Maybe.

269
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:12,087
Which means he has absolutely no reason
to tell us who else is involved in this.

270
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:15,632
But I can make him talk.

271
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,889
If we don't find these people,
one day they'll launch another attack,

272
00:23:20,014 --> 00:23:23,818
and I can't live with myself knowing
I could have done something to stop it.

273
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,701
I don't know what to do.

274
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:36,039
I can't tell you what to do.

275
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,023
I've been wrestling with this one
my whole life.

276
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,635
I see 15 people held hostage
on a bus,

277
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:45,757
and everything else
goes out the window.

278
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,676
And I will do whatever it takes
to save them,

279
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,152
whatever it takes.

280
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,427
I guess maybe I thought...

281
00:23:58,402 --> 00:23:59,752
if I save them...

282
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,030
I'd save myself.

283
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:07,445
Do you regret anything
you did today?

284
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:18,484
Then again,
I don't work for the FBI.

285
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,125
I don't understand.

286
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,498
You took an oath.

287
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:27,245
You made a promise
to uphold the law.

288
00:24:29,998 --> 00:24:33,129
When you cross that line,
it always starts off with a small step.

289
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,488
Before you know it, you're running

290
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:37,854
as fast as you can
in the wrong direction to justify

291
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,044
what you started in the first place.

292
00:24:40,722 --> 00:24:43,872
These laws were written
by much smarter men than me.

293
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:47,823
And in the end, I know that these laws
have to be more important

294
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:51,093
than the 15 people on the bus.
I know that's right.

295
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:52,661
In my mind,

296
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,865
I know that's right.

297
00:24:57,905 --> 00:25:00,790
I just don't think my heart
could ever have lived with it.

298
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,110
I guess the only advice
I can give you is...

299
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:13,261
... try to make choices
that you can live with.

300
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,333
I don't know what to say.

301
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:37,874
Don't say anything at all.

302
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,890
Mr. Bauer, we really need to go.

303
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,164


304
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,082
What are you doing out of bed?

305
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:34,569
What's going on?

306
00:26:34,877 --> 00:26:37,327
Olivia wouldn't say
until you got here.

307
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,644
You'll understand when I tell you.

308
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:50,816
It's gonna be hard enough
to say once.

309
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:53,991
I'm listening, Livy.

310
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:56,273
What's this about?

311
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:01,968
Jonas Hodges.

312
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:06,666
He's dead because of me.

313
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:12,696
Don't tell me you were the one
who leaked the information.

314
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:15,066
It's worse than that.

315
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:19,578
Talk to us.

316
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,186
He killed Roger.

317
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,210
Hodges killed my brother.

318
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:37,655
And then you agreed
to put him into witness protection.

319
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,617
And the thought of him getting away
was too much for me.

320
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,350
So I called Martin Collier.

321
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:52,475
He had once...

322
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:56,269
told me he knew someone
who could do this kind of thing.

323
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,033
You're saying...

324
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,046
Collier hired someone
to kill Jonas Hodges?

325
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:09,520
I did.

326
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,356
I tried calling it off,

327
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:16,603
but it was too late,
and everything was happening so fast.

328
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:20,573
Who else knows about this?

329
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:28,216
He has a recording
of my conversation with Martin.

330
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:32,100
He's agreed not to turn it over
to the attorney general.

331
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,605
He says he'll respect whatever
you decide to do with the evidence.

332
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:43,471
- Mom, say something.
- How could you do this?

333
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,220
How could you do something
so stupid?

334
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:49,560
I'm sorry!
I tried to call it off, I swear!

335
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,207
It doesn't matter, darling,
it happened!

336
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:55,132
For God's sake, Allison,
stop yelling at her.

337
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,818
Hodges killed our son.

338
00:28:58,542 --> 00:28:59,904
I know what he did.

339
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:01,453
Then you know

340
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:04,659
if anyone deserves to die, it's him.

341
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:09,494
All you should be thinking about now
is how to protect our daughter.

342
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,363
Protect her?

343
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:14,696
How?

344
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,879
Destroy that recording.

345
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:19,762
And cover up a murder?

346
00:29:21,322 --> 00:29:24,040
Henry,
I can't just disregard the law!

347
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:26,474
Allison, spare me your sanctimony.

348
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:28,599
You're Olivia's mother.

349
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,686
I'm also the president
of the United States.

350
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:35,504
And our family's already paid
a steep enough price for that.

351
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,362
What are you saying, Henry?

352
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:44,049
You know exactly what I'm saying.

353
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:47,790
Your job cost our son his life.

354
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:52,595
That is a cruel thing to say.

355
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:57,335
I couldn't have done anything

356
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,339
- to prevent Roger's death.
- But you can do something about this.

357
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:04,557
For God's sakes, Allison...

358
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:07,873
We've already lost one child.

359
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,312
Sorry, Madam President,
but there's some news

360
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,231
from the Bureau you need to hear.

361
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:21,657
Good news.

362
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:28,179
I'll be down in a moment, Tim.

363
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:31,894
Yes, ma'am.

364
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:39,018
Go, Allison.

365
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:42,934
But so help me...

366
00:30:44,772 --> 00:30:46,260
destroy that recording...

367
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,064
and save what's left of this family.

368
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,747
Dad, what did I do?

369
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:28,468
We're going to figure this out.

370
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:31,078
I'm sorry.

371
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:35,537
We'll figure it out.

372
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,441
He's a high-value suspect, make sure
you restrict access until I get there.

373
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,586
<i>Agent Walker's bringing him back
now.</i>

374
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,904
- What's their ETA?
- About 10 minutes.

375
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,572
I'll be there in 20,
have transfer papers in order by then.

376
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:54,784
Excuse me, Chloe?

377
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:58,666
I've got to work on transfer papers,
so we'll have to schedule debriefing

378
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,544
- for later.
- I can come back later, or tomorrow.

379
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:02,996
You staying in town?

380
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,630
I want to be here for Jack.

381
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:09,969
I'd like to thank you
for all the help

382
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,062
- you gave me today.
- Yeah, it was interesting.

383
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:16,987
Given what you have to work with,
you're doing a pretty good job.

384
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:21,272
I'll take that as a compliment.
Thank you.

385
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:24,324
Good.
That's what it was meant to be.

386
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,176
Because the pathogen was weaponized,

387
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:02,601
the disease is at an advanced stage.

388
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,734
I'm sorry, Mr. Bauer.

389
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,403
All I can do is administer morphine,

390
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,310
which will induce a coma,
but you won't feel any pain.

391
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:13,535
No morphine.

392
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:14,783
Not yet, please.

393
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,330
Excuse me Dr. Macer,
Mr. Bauer has a visitor.

394
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:24,251
All right.

395
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:31,318
He'll see you now.

396
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,033
I'll be outside.

397
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,444
Thanks for coming.

398
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:53,503
I was surprised to get your call.

399
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:56,672
I'm dying.

400
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:02,104
I know.

401
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,184
I made so many mistakes.

402
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,377
And I always thought that
I would have the time to correct them.

403
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:19,043
You've the time.

404
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:21,165
Right now.

405
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,730
You don't know what I've done.

406
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:31,777
We live in complex times.

407
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:35,564
Nothing is black and white.

408
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,129
But I do know this.

409
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:42,219
I see before me a man,

410
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:44,857
with all his flaws,

411
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,349
and all his goodness.

412
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,155
Simply a man.

413
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,230
Let us both forgive ourselves
for all the wrongs that we have done.

414
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:25,289
Thank you.

415
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:37,785
It's time.

416
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:04,119
Olivia, come and sit down.

417
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:05,906
I can't.

418
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:50,196
I never imagined that this job

419
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:53,919
would be so hard on both of you.

420
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:57,471
I had no idea

421
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,466
of the price this family would pay.

422
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,842
And for that, I am so sorry.

423
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:09,764
But I have

424
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,822
a sworn duty

425
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:14,393
to enforce the Constitution.

426
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:20,069
And failing to honor that oath
would be the worst kind of hypocrisy.

427
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:24,575
I love you

428
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,372
more than anything in this world.

429
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:30,301
And I will do everything I can
to help you through this.

430
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,585
But as president,
this is what I have to do,

431
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:39,047
no matter how much
it breaks my heart.

432
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,662
Agent Pierce will remand you

433
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,390
to federal custody.

434
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,417
I am escorting you
to the Justice Department,

435
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:11,872
where you will be held
until formal charges

436
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,390
have been issued.

437
00:38:31,365 --> 00:38:32,715
I'm sorry, honey.

438
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:48,975
If you'd like to talk later...

439
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:58,829
As much as I wanted
to cover this up,

440
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:01,481
I couldn't.

441
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,693
You don't have
to explain yourself to me.

442
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:06,752
I understand completely.

443
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,655
Henry doesn't.

444
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,492
He'll come around.

445
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
In time.

446
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,789
I don't think he will, Ethan.

447
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,402
I really don't.

448
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:30,883
I've lost my family.

449
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:35,450
I've lost everyone.

450
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:41,379
Not everyone.

451
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:48,128
Then you'll take back
your letter of resignation?

452
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:50,935
If you want me to.

453
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,550
I do.

454
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:58,163
I need your help,

455
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,165
I need it now.

456
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:03,768
The FBI has taken a man
into custody.

457
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:05,593
His name is Alan Wilson.

458
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,015
Woods is on his way
to pick up Wilson,

459
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,643
you need to sign the documents.

460
00:41:47,459 --> 00:41:48,609
What's wrong?

461
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:53,073
What's going on?

462
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:55,708
- Get out of here.
- Excuse me?

463
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:58,056
- I said get out of here.
- What are you doing?

464
00:41:58,827 --> 00:41:59,850
Get out.

465
00:42:00,278 --> 00:42:03,687
Absolutely not. I'm staying right here
until Wilson is transferred.

466
00:42:05,428 --> 00:42:06,231
Fine.

467
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,758
What are you...?

468
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,027
- What are you doing?
- Put your hands over your head.

469
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,397
I said do it now, Janis!

470
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:17,025
Secure your hands to that pole.

471
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:19,122
- Now!
- Okay.

472
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:21,745
Just calm down, all right? Just...

473
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:26,186
Renee, please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

474
00:42:27,743 --> 00:42:30,023
You've done your job.
You arrested him.

475
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,299
Let the courts take it from here.

476
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,667
Stop this now,

477
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:35,895
before it's too late.

478
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:41,056
Don't throw away your career.
This is absolutely insane.

479
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,483
Larry would not have wanted this.

480
00:42:52,898 --> 00:42:55,148
Don't dishonor his death like this.

481
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,072
Daddy.

482
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:42,285
- I'm too late.
- He's still alive, Kim.

483
00:43:43,427 --> 00:43:44,996
We induced a coma to help

484
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,372
ease him through
the harsher symptoms.

485
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,777
My name is Gohar.

486
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:53,402
I'm a friend.

487
00:43:55,053 --> 00:43:56,048
A friend?

488
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,156
We spent the last
few minutes talking,

489
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,721
and I can tell you he's accepted
what is happening.

490
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:06,889
Maybe he has.

491
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:10,661
But I haven't.

492
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,983
The stem cell treatment
you told me about. Can we still do it?

493
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:17,570
As I told you, it's experimental
and the odds of success

494
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,532
- are very low.
- Just tell me if it's too late to try.

495
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,051
Then I want to do it.

496
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:26,395
- The risks...
- I understand the risks.

497
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,909
And I know my father didn't want me
to take that chance,

498
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:30,684
but it's my choice now,

499
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:32,460
I made up my mind.

500
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:42,487
This is Sunny Macer.

501
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:44,675
I need immediate access
to a surgical suite.

502
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,000
Have Dr. Rosen call me right away.

503
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:21,899
I'm sorry, Daddy.

504
00:45:25,925 --> 00:45:28,025
But I'm not ready to let you go.
