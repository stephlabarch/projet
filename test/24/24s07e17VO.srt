1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,556
Previously on 24

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Livy, it could take weeks to
find ethan's replacement.

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,660
In the meantime, i'm going

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,570
To need a provisional
chief of staff.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,430
I would like that to be you.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,370
I have larry moss
calling for you.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,940
Ma'am, we have evidence

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,440
juma allowed starkwood to use

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,700
Sangala as a base to
manufacture biological weapons.

10
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,770
Are you saying these
weapons are on us soil?

11
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:32,905
We suspect they're at the
starkwood headquarters

12
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:33,107
In virginia.

13
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,003
And you're not suggesting
that starkwood intends

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,882
To use those weapons to
attack this country?

15
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:39,152
Given their actions today,

16
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:41,120
We need to move on
starkwood immediately.

17
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:42,523
They're coming

18
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,791
And they'll be coming with
everything they've got

19
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:47,631
And the only thing that's
going to stop them

20
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,760
Is getting these
weapons ready to deploy.

21
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:52,360
Tell me what the fbi knows.

22
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:53,570
I don't know anything,

23
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,732
Mr. hodges.

24
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,640
Get him out of here

25
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,972
And do what you have to do.

26
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,540
I'm not spending
the rest of my life

27
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:05,042
In prison because jonas
hodges has lost his mind.

28
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,910
- You know where the weapons are?
- Yes.

29
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:08,613
Where's jack?

30
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,550
He managed to
secure the weapons,

31
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:12,280
But starkwood got him back.

32
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:13,920
Jack was exposed.

33
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:16,272
There has to be something
that you can do to help him.

34
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:17,420
there's no cure.

35
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:18,882
We got a location
on the weapon.

36
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:21,180
We're getting ready to
stage a raid on the compound

37
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:22,182
I wantto go.

38
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:24,661
I'm sorry. i can't allow it.

39
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:26,122
I'm the only one who's
seen the canisters.

40
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:27,690
I know exactly what
we're looking for.

41
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,093
But you're sick.
we have no idea

42
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:30,932
When you're going to
start showing symptoms.

43
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:32,003
You're right.

44
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,063
Where are the damn weapons?!

45
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:41,781
He played me.

46
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:43,783
Little old seaton
bought us some time.

47
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:46,071
We're going to do a point by point
search Of this entire compound.

48
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:47,553
Of this entire compound.

49
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,081
There are biological
weapons on this facility.

50
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,623
We're not going
anywhere without them.

51
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,402
You try to advance any farther,

52
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,671
You will be fired upon.

53
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:05,671
The following takes place
between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m.

54
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,981
I count three
platoons at least.

55
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:16,453
Everything mil-spec.

56
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,321
Yeah. they were waiting for us.

57
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:21,292
This was one big trap.

58
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,621
Renee, we would really use
those satellite overheads.

59
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:24,893
Copy, larry.

60
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:26,662
- What have we got? - Nothing.

61
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:27,933
The subnet's been crashing.

62
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:29,433
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
here we go.

63
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:31,433
I've got sat five
retasting now...

64
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:32,802
Somebody talk to me.

65
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,073
What are you seeing?

66
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,831
Larry, you've got
hostiles on all sides.

67
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,442
Damn it. find me an opening.

68
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:38,301
I'm looking,

69
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,660
- But there's no way through.
- Okay, heads up.

70
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,172
Is everybody seeing this?

71
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:43,370
Larry?

72
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:45,583
Yeah.

73
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:46,950
Yeah. we're seeing it.

74
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:00,862
It's hodges.

75
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:04,732
The men are at the ready, sir.

76
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,130
I appreciate your presence.

77
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,072
Where else would i be?

78
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,603
Who's in charge here?

79
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,473
I am.

80
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:13,843
Agent moss.

81
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,882
You need to move your men
and allow us to proceed.

82
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,641
I want you off our property

83
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:20,881
And i want you to
release my man.

84
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:22,851
You have no right to
take him hostage.

85
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:25,722
I have an order from the
president of the united states.

86
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:28,221
To search this building.

87
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:32,020
For weapons that do not exist.

88
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:34,331
Have you looked?

89
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,331
Are there weapons of
mass destruction?

90
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,260
Are there weapons of any kind?

91
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,501
Is there anything
in here at all?!

92
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,372
Agent moss,

93
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:52,512
Who dreamed up this charade?

94
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:54,081
Give me a name.

95
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:55,973
Let's get to the
bottom of this.

96
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:59,452
You want to talk to me,
mr. hodges?

97
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,590
Get these guns off my head.

98
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:04,520
You think you have
a gun at your head?

99
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:05,993
You know what i've got?

100
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,791
I've got the united states
government sending swat teams

101
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,003
And attack helicopters in
the middle of the night.

102
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:15,870
I've got a government that i
served faithfully for 30 years

103
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,341
Dreaming up bs accusations

104
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:21,813
So politicians too cowardly
to show their faces

105
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,043
Can dismantle my company.

106
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:25,581
That's what i've got.

107
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:31,623
You've got five minutes

108
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:34,622
To get these-these
helicopters flying out of here

109
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,793
With all of you on board.

110
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,190
You don't want to do this.

111
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,890
Five minutes.

112
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:43,180
And i want my man back.

113
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:51,972
Renee, you get that?

114
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:53,073
Yeah, we did.

115
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,211
- And what options do we have?
- In five minutes?

116
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,031
I know there's no time to
bring in more tac support,

117
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,340
So give me something else.

118
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:02,382
All right, larry, give me a second.
stand by.

119
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,550
That's it.

120
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,721
I want to show you something.

121
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,582
Hodges just gave us five
minutes to clear the base.

122
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,400
We lost that situation.
we were outmaneuvered

123
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:12,852
But i think i found
us a new way in.

124
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,662
Look. these are
senator mayer's files.

125
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:17,521
This is douglas knowles.
he's the chairman of starkwood.

126
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:18,550
He was actually helping

127
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:19,922
The senator with
the investigation.

128
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,600
He is the one who brokered the
deal to open the company's books.

129
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,261
What, another insider?
didn't we just get burned?

130
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:25,401
Just listen.

131
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,512
Knowles was loyal to
hodges for almost 20 years

132
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:29,000
And now he's
secretly helping the

133
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:30,203
senator take down
the starkwood.

134
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:31,340
He's scared of something.

135
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,183
This man wants to help us.

136
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:34,651
It's worth a shot.

137
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:36,611
Yeah. make the call.

138
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,621
Knowles.

139
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:47,430
Mr. knowles,
my name is jack bauer.

140
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,190
I got your number
from senator mayer.

141
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:50,253
Senator mayer is dead.

142
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:52,750
Yes, sir, i know.
i was with him when he was killed

143
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:53,790
By one of your employees.

144
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:56,835
A man named john quinn.

145
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,817
You have no idea how much i
was hoping someone would call.

146
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,943
I'm sorry, sir.
i don't understand.

147
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,110
Things are very out of control.

148
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:08,632
Are you aware of what's
happening on your base?

149
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,683
I'm watching it
with my own eyes.

150
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:11,953
The fbi is pinned down.

151
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,752
They say they're
looking for bioweapons.

152
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:15,523
Sir, jonas hodges
is  in possession.

153
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:17,462
Of a military-grade bioweapon.

154
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,033
A prion variant developed in
africa with general juma.

155
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,131
Well, it's not where
they think it is.

156
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,503
They're all standing in
front of an empty hangar.

157
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,661
The fbi was deliberately
led to the wrong location

158
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,490
By a man named seaton,
but i promise you, sir,

159
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:29,873
The weapon is on your base.

160
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,372
I was contaminated when trying
to intercept the canisters.

161
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:33,731
They were ferried
back to starkwood

162
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:35,173
Approximately 90 minutes ago.

163
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:37,382
90 minutes ago jonas
was handing down

164
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,040
His new strategy to the board.

165
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:42,651
Stonewall the government,
no cooperation whatsoever.

166
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:44,683
I can't believe
this is happening.

167
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:45,822
Sir, this is happening

168
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,280
And i promise you the
weapons are on your base.

169
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,323
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

170
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,592
I think i might.

171
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,330
Mr. knowles,
i want to put you in touch

172
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:55,581
With one of my
men in the field.

173
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,360
- Can i call you right back?
- Yes.

174
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,762
Thank you. go.

175
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:03,173
Some of the men were unhappy
drawing down on federal agents.

176
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:05,240
It's understandable.

177
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:08,272
I had hoped not to
include the rank and file.

178
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:10,412
You can count on them.

179
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:13,742
Let's show our guests the door.

180
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,183
Let's move!

181
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:20,091
Into position.

182
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,730
Jack, i'm on comm.

183
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,463
You're on with me
and agent walker.

184
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,290
Hodges' men have
repositioned themselves.

185
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,971
Okay, we're going to
have to move fast.

186
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:35,323
Larry, i want you and your men

187
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:36,761
To pull out on
hodges' timetable.

188
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:38,560
Tony, you're going to need to
find a way to stay behind.

189
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:39,662
We're going to get your vectors

190
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,660
over to a man that we
contact inside starkwood.

191
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,030
His name is douglas knowles.

192
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,571
He believes he knows
where the weapons are.

193
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:46,542
Isn't this how we
got into this mess?

194
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,613
Almeida and some supposedly
friendly contact?

195
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:49,553
Knowles is chairman

196
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:51,213
Of the starkwood board,
but he was cooperating

197
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:52,970
With senator mayer's
investigation of the company.

198
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:54,392
Larry, he is all
that we've got.

199
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:58,120
All right, i got 400 eyeballs
trained on me right now.

200
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,923
How the hell are we supposed
to get almeida to stay behind?

201
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:02,723
Larry, i need you and your
men to create a diversion

202
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:03,763
To cover tony's escape.

203
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,161
Look, we need to
make this work.

204
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:07,222
If you all get on those
helicopters together,

205
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:09,270
We are going to lose
this weapon for good.

206
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:15,741
Larry, are you on
board with this?

207
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,013
We got to go.

208
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:20,981
Larry, we need to know,
are you on board?

209
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,812
I'll do what i can.

210
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:27,183
Take his bag.

211
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,193
All right, let's go.

212
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,361
We're standing down.
you're coming with me.

213
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:32,793
Hey, wait a minute.

214
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,130
This wasn't part of the deal.

215
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,950
What deal?as far as I
could tell,he couldn't

216
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,893
- care about you£¬one way or the other.
- Moss.

217
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,632
You take these
handcuffs off of me

218
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:41,120
Or it's going to
get really ugly.

219
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:47,171
Soldier!

220
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,510
Get the hell out of here, Moss.

221
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:55,682
You don't want to test us.

222
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:58,583
Let's go!

223
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:39,993
- Don't move. - No!

224
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:41,261
Doug Knowles.

225
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:43,561
- Jack Bauer sent me.- Come on.

226
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:54,013
That street has
security cameras.

227
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,211
I'll take you to
a restricted area.

228
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:57,613
It's on the east perimeter.

229
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:59,610
There's a good chance
the weapons are there.

230
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,152
The place is crawling.

231
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,140
I don't know how we're
going to make it.

232
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:04,820
I'll take care of that.

233
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,022
Jack, I'm with Knowles.

234
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:10,323
I'm going to need satellite
support on the east perimeter.

235
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:14,701
Jack, I need support.
do you copy?

236
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,352
Jack, Raines, anybody

237
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:18,500
Copy, Tony.

238
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,211
Come on, let's go.

239
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:22,472
I've got you just
off the landing pad.

240
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:24,201
No hostiles in your
immediate vicinity.

241
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:25,363
Proceed at your own discretion.

242
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:26,371
Copy that.

243
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,243
Which way?

244
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:29,100
Come on.

245
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,240
Jack.

246
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:35,952
You all right?

247
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:37,581
Yeah, I'm fine.

248
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:40,711
Tony and Knowles have connected.
We're good.

249
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,283
It's time to call the
White House with an update.

250
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:44,362
Okay, good.
I'll be right there.

251
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:04,413
Madam President,
excuse the interruption.

252
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:05,943
Jack Bauer is on line seven.

253
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,922
Mr. Bauer,
tell me you have the bioweapon.

254
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,053
Madam President,
I'm afraid that's not the case.

255
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:16,111
Our search was stopped
by armed mercenaries

256
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,022
On Starkwood's base.

257
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,710
Agent Moss and his men
were forced to withdraw

258
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,951
From a firefight they most
certainly would have lost.

259
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,881
Are you saying Hodges
men were ready to fire

260
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:24,430
On federal agents?

261
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:25,961
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

262
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,001
My god!

263
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:29,241
Who does he think he is?!

264
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:31,660
Madam President,
despite the setback,

265
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:33,532
I am confident the
weapons are still there.

266
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:35,213
I reached out to
Starkwood's chairman.

267
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:37,542
He's willing to cooperate.
He's with Tony Alameida now.

268
00:11:37,717 --> 00:11:39,742
They are moving towards
a secure area on the base

269
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:41,603
Where we believe the
weapons are being held.

270
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:41,893
Very good.

271
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:43,703
Tim, what's our troop status?

272
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:43,950
Mobilizing.

273
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:45,871
The Secretary of Defense says

274
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,113
They're still
several hours out.

275
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,780
At which point we have
a war on our hands

276
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:50,120
Against 1,500 mercenaries

277
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:51,790
Armed with bioweapons.

278
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,223
Madam President,
I do believe that a surgical air strike

279
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:55,770
Will work as long
as we can pinpoint

280
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:57,251
The exact location
of the weapon.

281
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,232
And you can do that?

282
00:11:58,406 --> 00:11:59,602
Yes, I believe we can.

283
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,212
Mr. Bauer,
you've seen the canisters

284
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:02,892
Containing the bioweapons,
you know what

285
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,191
They look like,
is that correct?

286
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,273
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:07,672
Then we'll need you to
verify the canisters

288
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,912
Once Almeida has located them.

289
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:10,880
No more mistakes.

290
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,703
We're gonna need
visual confirmation

291
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,352
From you, Bauer-- eyes on.

292
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:17,352
Jack, we have got to
get this part right.

293
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:19,080
I understand. anything else?

294
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:26,920
Jack, I have been told that you
were exposed To the pathogen.

295
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:28,131
How you doing?

296
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,050
Right now I'm fine,
Madam President.

297
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,432
Thank you for asking.

298
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,530
Thank you for your service.

299
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:36,402
I'm not giving up on you.

300
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:38,003
Keep me informed.

301
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:39,470
Yes, ma'am.

302
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:41,640
Let's go.

303
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:52,652
I don't have a lot of time.

304
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:53,473
What's going on?

305
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,043
That's what i've been
trying to ask you.

306
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:56,023
I called three times.

307
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:57,560
It's kind of crazy
here right now.

308
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,250
Unless it's urgent,
I gotta call you back.

309
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:01,023
I'm hearing rumors
that the joint chiefs

310
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,363
Have been called in.

311
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:04,211
It's not a big deal.

312
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:06,120
They're just doing
a final assessment

313
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:07,421
Before lowering
the alert level.

314
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,700
Olivia, don't do this.

315
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,032
What?

316
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:11,370
I'm telling you the truth.

317
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:12,602
Really?

318
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:15,003
Because I've got a source
in the port authority

319
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,960
Container yard who's
using terms like "weapons

320
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:19,101
Of mass destruction," so
naturally I'm wondering

321
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,782
If that's why the joint
chiefs are having a meeting.

322
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,253
Look, I can't talk about it.

323
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,420
It's obviously a question
of national security.

324
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,652
But you have my word I'll
tell you soon as I can.

325
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:30,090
I want to know now.

326
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:34,490
I just gave you
a big story, Ken.

327
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:36,432
You'll have to wait.
I gotta go.

328
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,061
Don't hang up on me, Olivia.

329
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:41,233
That'd be a big mistake.

330
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:43,931
What's that supposed to mean?

331
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,870
You want me to say it,
fine, I'll say it.

332
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:48,930
Think how your mother
would feel when she hears

333
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,660
That you forced out
her chief of staff

334
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,211
So you could take
over his position.

335
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:56,083
He was incompetent.

336
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,751
Yeah, well, it won't play
that way on the morning news.

337
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:00,680
So, talk to me.

338
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,720
Now.

339
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,220
I can't talk here.

340
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,993
I'm in the Roosevelt Continental,
room 1271.

341
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,361
You've got half an hour.

342
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,410
Agent Pierce,
please get a car ready.

343
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:23,240
I have to make a quick run.

344
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,210
All right, Jack, we're here.

345
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,172
Knowles says there's
been increased activity

346
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,612
In this area for
several days now.

347
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm looking at about a
half a dozen buildings.

348
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:37,593
Could be any one of them.

349
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:38,410
Copy that, Tony.

350
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:40,381
Hold on,
we're getting infrared up now.

351
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:43,230
I'm counting seven buildings
in your immediate vicinity.

352
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,352
The building directly
southeast of your current

353
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:49,903
Position is showing
no infrared signal.

354
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:51,882
I'm guessing they're
using a blackout shield.

355
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,360
All right,
we'll try there first.

356
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,172
You see any patrols
coming our way?

357
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:56,973
Negative, you're clear.

358
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,513
Okay, let's go.

359
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,281
Jack, Knowles' key
card isn't working.

360
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,262
We're gonna need
electronic support here.

361
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:20,851
There should be an
r-6 interface module

362
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,252
On the back of
your comm device.

363
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:22,293
It's a card key.

364
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:24,593
Yeah, I know what that is,
thank you.

365
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,342
I'm plugging in now.

366
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:32,311
Okay, we're up.

367
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:33,741
Cormac z series.

368
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,582
We're looking at
a five digit key

369
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:38,421
Protected by an
aes block cipher.

370
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:41,152
Running combinations.

371
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,653
Okay, Tony,
you've got a vehicle coming your way.

372
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,890
It's east of you
about a hundred yards.

373
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,091
Take cover down there.

374
00:15:50,636 --> 00:15:51,563
How much longer?

375
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:53,420
How much more time do you need?

376
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,403
I only have two
out of five digits.

377
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,573
We're pretty exposed here.

378
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:00,173
Jack?

379
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,192
It's all right, I'm fine.

380
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:05,013
Come on.

381
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:11,911
Stand down out of here

382
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,420
Two more numbers, Tony.

383
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,032
What are we gonna do?

384
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:25,930
We still got two digits to go.

385
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,401
Move in for a closer look.

386
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,002
We are not gonna make it.

387
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,102
Sit tight.

388
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,570
Doug, where you-- doug!

389
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:49,722
Hold your position.

390
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:51,792
May I see some id?

391
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:54,061
Doug Knowles.

392
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:58,681
Dame it.

393
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:01,353
One to go.

394
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:05,841
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.

395
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:07,403
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base

396
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:09,763
Cleared of all
nonessential personnel.

397
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,412
Nonessential personnel?

398
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,442
I'm chairman of the board.

399
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,941
I realize that,
but we're dealing

400
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,602
With a heightened
security situation here.

401
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:19,180
So, I need to know what you
were doing in this area.

402
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,580
Jonas called a late night

403
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:23,393
Board meeting,
that's what I'm doing here.

404
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,622
Sir, that meeting ended
nearly 12 hours ago.

405
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:28,863
We got it; we're in.

406
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:31,432
I don't have to explain myself to you,
you know.

407
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:34,030
I'm sorry, sir, but you do.

408
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,023
Sir, I don't believe
you're hearing me.

409
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,801
No, I don't think
you're hearing me!

410
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,640
Look, I built this company!

411
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:42,571
And I don't need you telling me

412
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,710
Where I can and cannot walk!

413
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,381
Understood?!

414
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,143
You're gonna have to
come with me, sir.

415
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:49,951
Right this way.

416
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:55,553
I'm in.

417
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:56,572
But they got Knowles.

418
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:58,382
Do you think he's
gonna say anything?

419
00:17:58,498 --> 00:17:59,462
I don't know.

420
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,091
But I better get in and out

421
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:02,961
As fast as possible
just in case he does.

422
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,743
Okay, Tony,
the president needs a visual

423
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,423
On the weapons before
she'll launch an attack.

424
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:07,460
She needs your eyes

425
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,632
On the canisters and a
confirmation by jack.

426
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,102
Copy that.

427
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:13,901
I'm moving.

428
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:14,971
Good.

429
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,343
Jack?

430
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:20,342
Stay here, i'll be right back.

431
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:25,320
Jack! jack?!

432
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,180
jack!

433
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,690
Jack?!

434
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,591
Jack?

435
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,161
Get me the medic!

436
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:44,892
Yes, sir.

437
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,590
We just found mr. knowles alone

438
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,341
Just outside the
restricted zone.

439
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,400
Did he have an explanation?

440
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, sir,
he said he was walking.

441
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:55,831
Walking.

442
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,503
Should i take him to stokes
for interrogation, sir?

443
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:02,470
You're suggesting what, soldier,
that we strap him down,

444
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,510
Extract a confession,
because he was walking?

445
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,680
He's the chairman of the board.

446
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:10,251
I was just requesting
instructions, sir.

447
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:11,851
What you'd like done.

448
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,193
I'd like you to take
him to his office.

449
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:15,690
Make sure he's comfortable.

450
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,192
And stay with him
until i arrive.

451
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,663
Yes, sir.

452
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:21,092
Will that be all?

453
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:22,331
Call zone nine,

454
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:23,830
Have them double down security.

455
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:26,733
Let's make sure that mr.
knowles was in fact alone.

456
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:27,902
Yes, sir.

457
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,511
How much longer?

458
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,121
Half an hour.

459
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:46,451
Good.

460
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,223
I'll need to know
the minute it's done.

461
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,721
Yes, sir.

462
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:59,730
Aaron, i'd like you to wait in the hall,
if that's okay.

463
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:03,441
Ms. taylor, you tasked me
with handling your security.

464
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,601
I can't allow you to
enter a hotel room

465
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,770
I haven't vetted.

466
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:12,311
Aaron, i appreciate
the concern.

467
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:15,411
But you can see
the door from here,

468
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,282
I have you on speed-dial,

469
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,322
And i can scream very loudly
when the occasion demands.

470
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:23,490
I just need two minutes
to wrangle a reporter.

471
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,790
Really, i'll be fine.

472
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:28,431
All right,
i'll be here if you need me.

473
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,710
- Want a drink? - No.

474
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,583
I assume you don't
mind if i do.

475
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:54,993
It's been a day.

476
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,360
I gotta tell you.

477
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:00,962
I don't like being threatened.

478
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:02,290
It was unfortunate.

479
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,600
I apologize.

480
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,833
We've known each other
a long time, ken.

481
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:07,402
I thought we had
an understanding.

482
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:08,872
We do.

483
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,440
And i want to keep it that way.

484
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:14,741
We both do. am i right?

485
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:20,281
Okay, so, i told you,
i have this source.

486
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:22,781
Cop,out at the port
authority container yard.

487
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:24,122
Okay.

488
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:26,332
He told me he saw these
professional assassin types

489
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:29,080
Get into an intense firefight
out there a couple hours ago.

490
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:31,533
According to him,
someone hijacked a wmd

491
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:33,160
out to god knows where.

492
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:35,862
That's true.

493
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:37,331
Yeah.

494
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:39,001
Yeah, i want to
know all about it.

495
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:46,471
Look, if you think all you've
got to do is nod your head

496
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,922
Confirming what i already know,
then we've got a problem.

497
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,181
It's national security, ken.

498
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:52,482
I can't tell you.

499
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:54,381
I'm saying you can.

500
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:57,552
If this story breaks,
it would create a panic.

501
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:58,730
People would be hurt.

502
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:01,161
If you knew what it was,
you'd understand why

503
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,181
It's got to stay a secret.

504
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:04,761
Right, exactly. i'd understand.

505
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:08,032
Have a little faith, okay?

506
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:13,901
All right. there is a bioweapon
in the container yard.

507
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,870
That's what they
were fighting over.

508
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:18,203
It was developed by
starkwood in africa.

509
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:20,341
-Starkwood? -Right.

510
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:23,342
They moved it to their base
about 30 miles from here.

511
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:28,182
So it's there right now.

512
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:34,023
So this is what the joint
chiefs are discussing,

513
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:35,420
What to do about that.

514
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,823
Olivia...

515
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:48,832
The president
ordered an air strike

516
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:54,073
As soon as the exact location
of the canisters was known.

517
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:59,040
So you see why you
can't run with this?

518
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:02,312
Really, ken, you can't.

519
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:04,072
A lot of lives are at stake.

520
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:06,480
The entire plan
depends on surprise.

521
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:08,122
You get that, right?

522
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:16,462
Maybe you're right.

523
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,730
Maybe i need to
kill this story.

524
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,982
Thank you.

525
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:26,910
What i mean is maybe
somebody could convince me.

526
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,141
What are you saying?

527
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:34,453
You know what i'm saying.

528
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,612
You're very beautiful when
you get all patriotic.

529
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:37,880
I ever tell you that?

530
00:23:38,057 --> 00:23:38,980
That's over. we agreed.

531
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:40,291
You agreed.

532
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,890
Really, i don't
want to do this.

533
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,361
Ken...

534
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,163
Then say no.

535
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:09,681
This is pandopamine which
should control the shaking.

536
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:11,153
Here, apply pressure.

537
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:13,152
You can give yourself
an injection

538
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,152
Once every two hours.

539
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,293
More if needed.

540
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:17,890
You think i'll need more?

541
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:19,263
In all likelihood, yes.

542
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:22,560
The onset of symptoms so
soon after exposure suggests

543
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:24,700
The bio-agent is more
virulent than we thought.

544
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:28,500
All we're doing here is
just masking the symptoms.

545
00:24:28,678 --> 00:24:29,403
I understand.

546
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,931
There's something you may
want to consider, though.

547
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:33,743
What's that?

548
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:35,871
Bryden university has
been funding some studies

549
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:36,770
On prion diseases.

550
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,192
The work is purely experimental

551
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:40,143
At this point,
but it does suggest treatment.

552
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:41,251
That's good news.

553
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:43,283
I don't want to get
anyone's hopes up here.

554
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:45,520
We're talking a slight chance.

555
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:47,171
A possible treatment
using stem cells

556
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:48,482
From a genetically
compatible donor.

557
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:50,090
An immediate family member

558
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:51,722
Would make the best
donor candidate.

559
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:52,862
I saw your file.

560
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,833
It says you have
a daughter, right?

561
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,763
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

562
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:59,130
- Jack, if there's a chance.
- Mr. bauer...

563
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:01,301
Doctor, thank you for
everything you've done.

564
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:03,643
Excuse me.
i need to get back to work.

565
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:09,440
Jack...

566
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:11,802
This is none of your business.

567
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:13,792
It's my business when
you're having a seizure

568
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,940
- In the middle of the fbi.
- You heard the doctor.

569
00:25:16,118 --> 00:25:17,571
The medication will
mask the symptoms.

570
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,080
Why won't you even
talk about this?

571
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,120
- Talk about what? -
The experimental procedure.

572
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:22,753
Because there's
nothing to talk about.

573
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,561
She's your daughter,
and you're not even gonna let her know?

574
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:26,631
That's right.

575
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:28,833
So you're just not
even gonna try?

576
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,251
Renee, i know you're
trying to help,

577
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:33,353
But you don't know what
you're talking about here.

578
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,001
My daughter and i,
we don't talk, okay?

579
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,641
So, please, just let it go.

580
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:43,010
It should be her choice.

581
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:45,210
Well, it's not.

582
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:49,111
I'm the one who's dying.
it's my choice.

583
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:57,023
No sign of the target yet,
but tony's working on it.

584
00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:58,522
You look better.

585
00:25:58,697 --> 00:26:00,261
Thanks.

586
00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:03,030
Tony, can you hear me?

587
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:04,432
Jack, you okay?

588
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,060
Yeah, i'm fine.

589
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:09,403
Okay, tony, we're seeing new
activity outside the building.

590
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:10,872
Two vehicles, eight hostiles.

591
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:12,503
Looks like a security detail.

592
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,012
You think knowles gave him up?

593
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:16,330
Tony, they're moving straight
for your point of entry.

594
00:26:21,557 --> 00:26:22,811
Eight hostiles and closing.

595
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:23,922
Yeah, i hear them.

596
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,021
You want to regroup?

597
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:28,050
No, i want to get
this over with.

598
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:31,350
Clear. Move.

599
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:41,033
Clear. Right there.

600
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:50,070
Two three, we're clear.

601
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:14,681
I haven't seen you here before.

602
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:17,750
They just sent eight
of us over here, sir.

603
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:19,410
Why, is something wrong?

604
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,920
No, sir.
just, you know, precautions.

605
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:25,450
Right, right.
can't be paranoid enough.

606
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:35,663
I'm in the main building.

607
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:37,201
Copy, we're with you.

608
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,802
Tony, it's jack.

609
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:40,893
I've got you at 125 feet msl,

610
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:43,662
Approximately 40 feet underground.
is that correct?

611
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:45,573
That's right.
i'm four floors down.

612
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:47,483
We've got no information
on any kind of

613
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:49,282
subterranean floors
in that building.

614
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:50,713
Believe me, they're here.

615
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:54,483
Epoxy-hardened walls,
poured concrete ceilings.

616
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:09,001
I have a visual on the weapon.

617
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:12,102
Sending images for
verification now.

618
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:14,470
Copy that.

619
00:29:27,427 --> 00:29:28,632
Okay, those are the canisters.

620
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:29,800
I'll notify admiral smith the

621
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,891
target is located and confirmed

622
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:33,552
Tony, those are the canisters.

623
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,861
Jack, it looks like
they're transferring

624
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:39,482
The pathogens from
the canisters

625
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,531
Into some sort of
delivery system.

626
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:43,162
It's on the move.

627
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:44,500
Copy that. it doesn't matter.

628
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:45,992
Renee's phoning in
the coordinates.

629
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:47,370
Everything's gonna be dust
in the next ten minutes.

630
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:49,502
- Get out of there now.
- Copy that.

631
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:51,342
Withdrawing.

632
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:04,382
Okay, men.

633
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:15,161
You want to explain
this, jonas?

634
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:18,302
I'm arrested by our
own security force.

635
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,910
Held captive in my own
office like a prisoner.

636
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:24,141
They won't allow me a phone call,
even to you,

637
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:26,572
To find out what the
hell is going on!

638
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:30,142
Well, that's a lot
of complaints, doug.

639
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:31,712
You done?

640
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:34,681
You were supposed to
be home hours ago.

641
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:36,851
Why'd they find you
snooping around?

642
00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:39,521
I saw the FBI raid.

643
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:41,420
They say we have bioweapons.

644
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:46,392
Which they did not find.

645
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:48,133
That's not the point.

646
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,100
Is it true?

647
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:54,701
Remember when I first brought
you out here 20 years ago?

648
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:56,042
There was nothing here.

649
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,970
Nothing.

650
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,871
And out of the damn mud,

651
00:31:00,045 --> 00:31:02,580
We built this place,

652
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:05,712
The largest private army in the
hemisphere, maybe the world,

653
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:09,451
And we pulled america's
ass out of the fire

654
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:11,890
Again and again and again.

655
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:13,651
Answer the question!

656
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:17,390
I am.

657
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,530
Every day, we've done things

658
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:23,100
That the government itself
could not or would not do.

659
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:23,911
"get this done,"

660
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:25,681
That's what they said,
"here's your mission."

661
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:28,371
Nobody asked how anything
was gonna be done.

662
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,972
Nobody wanted to know.

663
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:35,241
All anyone wanted was results,
and we delivered.

664
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:37,083
No one's questioning that.

665
00:31:37,258 --> 00:31:38,950
No one's questioning that?

666
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,852
You're not insane, are you?

667
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:44,120
The senate, the committees,
the president.

668
00:31:44,296 --> 00:31:47,023
Every chattering
nonentity in washington

669
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,361
Is out there with their
standard operating procedures

670
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:52,601
Saying, "how was this done?
How was that done?"

671
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:56,930
Tearing at us, trying to bring us down,
every one of them.

672
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:01,201
I kept this country strong.
I kept it safe.

673
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,702
And I will not be
persecuted for that.

674
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:09,010
Jonas, you cannot start
a war against the people

675
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,611
You're supposed to protect.

676
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:13,682
We were at war, doug,

677
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:16,252
The moment they decided
to dismantle us.

678
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:18,993
And as for particular weapons,

679
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:21,621
As for your question,
let me rephrase it.

680
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:24,561
Are we prepared to
defend ourselves?

681
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,232
We are.

682
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:29,303
Jonas...

683
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:34,673
You can't take on the
federal government.

684
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:40,241
Yeah, well,
you never were one for thinking big.

685
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,140
20 years

686
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:45,253
I treated you like a son.

687
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:47,080
20 years.

688
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:51,222
A little loyalty...

689
00:32:51,397 --> 00:32:54,451
Wasn't that the
least I deserved?

690
00:33:44,116 --> 00:33:45,411
Yes.

691
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:49,042
Sir, we just got an alert from
one of our radar intercepts.

692
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:51,381
There's a squadron of F-18's

693
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:54,811
Heading our way out
of virginia beach.

694
00:33:54,987 --> 00:33:56,022
Sir?

695
00:33:56,188 --> 00:33:57,352
What's the eta?

696
00:33:57,528 --> 00:33:58,891
Less than ten minutes.

697
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:01,221
- What's our readiness?
- how many?

698
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:04,593
We have three loaded.

699
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:06,562
Place the call to
the president.

700
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:09,960
I'll be there momentarily.

701
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,783
You probably think I'm the
scum of the earth right now.

702
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,953
All I care about is that you
don't run the starkwood story.

703
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,191
You're a real sport.

704
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,560
Taking one for the
team like this.

705
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:46,201
Look at me.

706
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:51,502
You won't run it, right?

707
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:56,860
I'm sorry, livy.

708
00:34:57,447 --> 00:34:58,593
What?

709
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,120
I have to run it.

710
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,491
Breaking something this big

711
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:05,323
Will put me over
the top in new york.

712
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:08,890
I'll make sure nobody knows
any of it came from you.

713
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,891
You lying son of a bitch.

714
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,730
Come on, please.

715
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:15,753
I'm did what I needed
to do to get ahead--

716
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,402
Just like you.

717
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:19,903
There's no comparison.

718
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,802
Running that story
will harm the country.

719
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:24,702
I've been in washington
a lot longer than you.

720
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,411
You'll see,
this is how the way the game is played.

721
00:35:27,577 --> 00:35:30,743
Actually, ken,
this is how the game is played.

722
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:34,813
What do you mean?

723
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:54,202
You run that story,
or ever try to blackmail me again,

724
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:55,940
And I'll make sure
everyone knows

725
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:58,070
Just how you get your leads.

726
00:35:58,246 --> 00:36:01,412
I think your wife will be
especially interested.

727
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:03,743
From everything you've told me,

728
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,613
That's gonna be
one nasty divorce.

729
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,982
You bitch

730
00:36:08,157 --> 00:36:10,780
Find a new beat, ken.

731
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:13,071
I don't want to see you
around the white house again.

732
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:19,430
Sorry, I've got to take this.

733
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:30,940
Hi.

734
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,640
Where in the world are you?

735
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,473
I'm sorry.
I had a meeting on k street.

736
00:36:34,648 --> 00:36:36,341
I had to run interference
with a reporter.

737
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:37,982
Are the press on to this?

738
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:39,550
Not anymore. I took care of it.

739
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:40,602
I need you here, livy.

740
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,341
We've had confirmation
on the bioweapons,

741
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,451
And the air strike
is happening now.

742
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:45,950
I'll be there in five minutes.

743
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,033
Where are we, admiral?

744
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:01,973
The f-18's have been loaded
with bunker-buster ordinance

745
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:05,103
And will be in range
in seven minutes.

746
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:07,340
What's the risk of
the pathogen spreading

747
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,610
To the surrounding areas?

748
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:09,442
Minimal.

749
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,502
We're using white
phosphorous charges,

750
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:12,780
Which burn at 5,000 degrees.

751
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:15,051
More than enough to
incinerate the pathogen.

752
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:16,722
And that's been
confirmed by the CDC.

753
00:37:16,888 --> 00:37:18,452
It has.

754
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:27,231
Weapons are ready?

755
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:28,630
Yes, sir.

756
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,670
The call to the president?

757
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:34,931
The call is in process.

758
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:38,873
It's an historic
day, gentlemen.

759
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,143
A great day for starkwood.

760
00:37:45,956 --> 00:37:48,951
Too bad mr.
knowles can't be joining us.

761
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:04,561
Roger, I need 9,000 feet

762
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:06,633
Msl and weapons
control status, over.

763
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:10,430
Weapon's control
status,yellow tight.

764
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:11,840
Fighters entering the ip.

765
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:13,541
Engage airspace
coordination area.

766
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:15,813
- Roger that. - stand by.

767
00:38:15,985 --> 00:38:18,110
Madam president,
command and control is reporting

768
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:20,180
That a phased
array radar system

769
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:22,010
Is active inside the
starkwood compound.

770
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:24,380
Meaning what exactly?

771
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,091
They know we're coming.

772
00:38:26,258 --> 00:38:30,292
Is there any evidence of an
antiaircraft artillery threat?

773
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:34,990
Intelligence is indicating no
such capability on the ground.

774
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,533
Madam president,
there's a phone call for you.

775
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:39,431
It's jonas hodges.

776
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:45,912
Put him on speaker.

777
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,140
Ma'am, he's requested
a private conversation.

778
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:50,032
He says he's established
a proprietary line

779
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:52,240
In the ops room.

780
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,380
A proprietary line?

781
00:38:54,555 --> 00:38:55,953
How did he manage that?

782
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,183
I have no idea.

783
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:26,281
Hello.

784
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:29,023
Madam president,
let me begin by saying

785
00:39:29,188 --> 00:39:31,482
That I am truly sorry
it's come to this.

786
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:35,860
At you turn your planes
around immediately.

787
00:39:36,026 --> 00:39:39,862
You're in no position to
issue ultimatums, mr. hodges.

788
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:42,662
Well, maybe I am.

789
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,733
You remember several years ago,
madam president,

790
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:48,370
Starkwood was
deployed to Pakistan.

791
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:50,440
Oh, I remember it very well.

792
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:51,871
I fought that deployment.

793
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:53,370
And you lost.

794
00:39:53,547 --> 00:39:54,673
You'll also recall

795
00:39:54,848 --> 00:39:57,643
That we requisitioned a
missile system at that time--

796
00:39:57,817 --> 00:39:59,183
Python fives.

797
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,712
Well, three of those missiles

798
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:02,252
Are now loaded
with the pathogen

799
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:05,350
And aimed at cities on
our eastern seaboard.

800
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:10,620
You're bluffing.

801
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:14,232
As a sign of good faith,

802
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:18,631
I'm willing to show you that i'm...
that i'm not bluffing.

803
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:24,043
You see that?

804
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:26,442
Madam president?

805
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,580
You call this good faith?

806
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:38,850
You are waging war on
your own country, jonas.

807
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:41,422
Well, of course,
I wouldn't see it that way.

808
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:45,022
What do you want?

809
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:47,933
Well, we can have
that conversation

810
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:50,133
A little later on
at the white house.

811
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:53,632
You think we're going to just
sit down and discuss this?

812
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:56,003
Yes i do, in the oval office,

813
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:57,371
In confidence,

814
00:40:57,546 --> 00:40:58,671
Within the hour.

815
00:40:58,848 --> 00:41:01,941
But in the meantime,
I think it is

816
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:03,113
To both of our advantage

817
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,312
That the american
people do not know

818
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,613
The exact circumstance
of this stand off.

819
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:10,321
So you will keep this
conversation to yourself,

820
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:12,181
And turn the planes around.

821
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:15,050
And if you don't comply,
madam president,

822
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:19,490
I will have no choice but
to launch those missiles.

823
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:22,863
Mr. hodges...

824
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:25,933
And remember,
i can detect any action you take

825
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,401
Against our facility.

826
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:30,771
You have 30 seconds.

827
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,372
Mr. hodges...

828
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:34,313
Mr. hodges!

829
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,473
Abort the air strike,
admiral smith.

830
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,670
Madam president...

831
00:42:06,845 --> 00:42:08,210
Just do as I say.

832
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:14,682
Ma'am, with all respect...

833
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:17,823
Damn it, admiral,
abort the air strike immediately!

834
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:20,091
This is admiral smith.

835
00:42:20,256 --> 00:42:21,952
I have an abort order
from the president.

836
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:23,321
Take fighters off target.

837
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:24,692
Take fighters

838
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:25,891
Off target.

839
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,560
Stand by for confirmation.

840
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:34,562
Roger that.

841
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:39,402
We're standing down,
madam president.

842
00:42:39,606 --> 01:25:15,610
