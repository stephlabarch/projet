3
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,066
Vladimir attacked you, you defended
yourself. That's what happened.

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,701
- I don't know.
- I do.

5
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,067
If anybody else ask you questions,
I'll be right there to answer them.

6
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:29,640
You were implying something about Dana,
I want to know what it is.

7
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:32,428
I think she went to meet some guy.

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,076
- Take a look.
- You think you can find her?

9
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:40,329
You promise me I do this thing for you,
and then you'll leave me alone.

10
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,541
<i>That's not gonna happen. </i>

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,789
It's a sweet operation
that we got going here.

12
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,358
You getting the access codes,

13
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>- and us pulling the jobs.
- You can't do this to me.</i>

14
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:56,365
You know who I am?

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,512
All I know is that there's a man
in the Russian syndicate

16
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:01,477
who's been trafficking
weapons-grade uranium.

17
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,938
- Who do you work for?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,149
Work on him,
until he's ready to talk.

19
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,510
It's over, you know that, right?

20
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:25,474
You want to know where the rods are?
I will tell you.

21
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,295
But I want full immunity.

22
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,678
- Command, are you seeing this?
- Where the hell are the rods?

23
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:38,764
<i>We picked up trace radiation signatures.
The rods were here.</i>

24
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,832
I told you, they were there.

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,353
- I had two of my men guarding them.
- <i>We found their bodies, both shot.</i>

26
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,920
I wasn't sure I believed
that you would betray your father.

27
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,278
You were upset,
now I've gotten them for you.

28
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,626
- When will you get here?
- <i>Less than five minutes.</i>

29
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:56,782
Just have my money ready.

30
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,214
<i>- CTU. O'Brian.</i>
- It's Jack.

31
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,788
<i>Do you have Hastings there?</i>

32
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:56,679
- Are you ready to trace the call?
- Yes.

33
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:59,807
As soon as Bazhaev gets his son
on phone, we can begin to triangulate.

34
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,132
Okay, hold on.

35
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:13,317
Farhad, where are you?
You're late.

36
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,201
It's me, your father.
Don't hang up. Stay on the line.

37
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,113
Please.

38
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,008
I know you have the rods.

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,786
- I wanted you to know.
- The police know, too.

40
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,039
- They're here.
- You told the police?

41
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,365
Of course not.

42
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:29,739
It was Vladimir's buyer...
he's a Federal agent.

43
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:31,906
Just so we're up front,
I'm here with your father.

44
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,462
I'm Jack Bauer. I work with CTU.

45
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,674
Do what you want.
I don't care.

46
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:38,884
Maybe you don't but your father

47
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,352
cares about you.

48
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:43,055
He negotiated immunity for you.

49
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,558
<i>All you need to do
is bring the fuel rods in,</i>

50
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,398
<i>and you can put the rest behind you.</i>

51
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:48,973
<i>It's the only way you'll be safe.</i>

52
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:51,897
Safe? Did my father tell you
about my other brother?

53
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:54,817
<i>- What he did to him?</i>
- Oleg was dying, you know that.

54
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,402
We could have saved him.

55
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,012
<i>He would be alive
if not for your precious deal.</i>

56
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,917
You are right,
maybe you are right, I don't know,

57
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,069
but... that doesn't bring Oleg back,

58
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,968
and I cannot bear
to lose another son.

59
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:07,204
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

60
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:09,456
- I'll be fine.
- No, you won't be.

61
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,892
You won't be anything.

62
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,017
It's over.

63
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,741
Federal agents are here
going through everything.

64
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,935
The entire city is under guard.

65
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,973
If you don't bring the rods in,
they will hunt you down.

66
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,276
They will kill you.

67
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,451
I won't be able to protect you.

68
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:28,104
I don't want to see you hurt.

69
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,856
If I hand over the rods,
how does this work?

70
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,234
Tell us where you are,
we'll bring you in.

71
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:38,922
Just like that?

72
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,392
After everything we've done?

73
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,740
Yes, I told you...
They have given us immunity.

74
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,681
Please, Josef, please.

75
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:49,067
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

76
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,249
<i>Are you there?</i>

77
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:55,503
- Yes, I'm here.
- You need to bring him in now,

78
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,858
before Farhad gets there.

79
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,006
Did you hear that?

80
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:00,508
<i>You need to move.</i>

81
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,673
I'm on my way.

82
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:09,791
I'll call you
to let you know where to meet me.

83
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:10,893
Careful.

84
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,233
- Sounded like shots fired.
- You need to help him!

85
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,277
- Where is he?!
- I don't know.

86
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:20,899
Did you get a trace on that call?

87
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:24,824
It looks like he was in central Queens
near Flushing Meadow Park.

88
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,371
I want units combing that area.
Bring your suspect back to CTU.

89
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,445
Copy that.

90
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,670
Get him ready for transport now.

91
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:36,998
Is he dead?

92
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:40,923
We need to hurry.
The boat is waiting for us at the port.

93
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,801
- The port may not be the right thing.
- What do you mean?

94
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,094
The authorities know.

95
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:47,072
We need a new plan.

96
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,533
Did you get that?

97
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:59,003
Yes. We're trying to get
an I.D. off the voice print.

98
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:01,068
So far, no luck
locking down a location.

99
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,762
Copy that.
We're on our way back now.

100
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,000
<i>Hurry.
Take the van and get the rods...</i>

101
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,503
We've got a match for the voice
at the end of the call... Farhad Hassan.

102
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:21,297
So, he got his fuel rods.

103
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,602
Any I.D. on the other man weeard?

104
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:24,727
No, sir.

105
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:27,303
Mr. Hastings, Rob Weiss for you.

106
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,556
Tell him I'll be right with him.

107
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,620
Give me an ETA on Bazhaev.

108
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,581
- Yes, sir.
- Start the interrogation

109
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,300
as soon as he gets here.

110
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,614
Jack, it's Chloe.
Hastings wants your ETA.

111
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,780
- He's anxious to interrogate Bazhaev.
- I'm about 15 minutes out.

112
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,978
But I wouldn't count
on getting anything from him.

113
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:55,122
If he could have told me how to get
to them, he would have.

114
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,125
Jack, I heard about
what you went through.

115
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:00,165
<i>Are you okay?</i>

116
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:03,024
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

117
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,424
How's Renee?

118
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:07,677
Pretty worried about you.

119
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,579
<i>They've still got her in medical.</i>

120
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,910
- Could you patch me through to her?
- Hold on.

121
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,357
<i>Rene, I have Jack.</i>

122
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,090
How are you?

123
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:29,699
- I'm fine. What about you?
- We had a line on the fuel rods.

124
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,034
We lost it.

125
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,788
<i>- What's the plan now?
- It's Hastings' call.</i>

126
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,082
I'm bringing the prisoner,
then I'm out.

127
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:40,901
They ask you about what happened,
about Vladimir?

128
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,308
- Yes, Chloe did.
- Chloe did the debrief?

129
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,663
I mean...

130
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:48,482
I wouldn't really call it a debrief.
We talked...

131
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,094
mostly and...

132
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,763
<i>- I wrote a statement.</i>
- You explained it was self-defense?

133
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,057
- Like we agreed.
- <i>That's how it happened.</i>

134
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,976
You've got to stick with that.

135
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,061
Yeah, I'm gonna try.

136
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,151
I know this is hard for you,

137
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,274
but you did nothing wrong,

138
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:06,441
<i>you need to start believing that.</i>

139
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:15,253
I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just gonna say it,

140
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,622
I need to make sure
that I'm not misunderstanding...

141
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>- When you say that I "have you"...</i>
- I meant it like it sounded.

142
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,983
What do we do now?

143
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:27,548
We'll figure it out.

144
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:32,011
I'll be in in 15 min.

145
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,781
<i>- Rob, it's Brian.</i>
- I got a flash from your office

146
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,280
how the immunity
the president authorized played out.

147
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:56,196
It's not good.
Really not.

148
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,645
Now, as I understand it, Bazhaev's son
swiped the rods before we got there.

149
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,087
- That's correct.
- And now the son is dead.

150
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,421
- Do we know who has the rods now?
- Apparently, it's Farhad Hassan.

151
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,594
- And where is he?
- <i>We're looking.</i>

152
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,384
Meaning you have no idea.

153
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,194
<i>I pushed the president
to resurrect CTU with you at the helm.</i>

154
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,902
<i>Now, you tell me you can do the job,
I believe you.</i>

155
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:19,170
- I can do the job
- Good to ear it.

156
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:21,706
When things
get this colossally screwed up,

157
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:23,567
people look for someone to blame.

158
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,479
- So what are you saying?
- I don't want that person to be you.

159
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:30,769
I put you there, you're my guy.

160
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:33,234
If you fail, I fail.

161
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,865
And that cannot happen.

162
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,785
Are we on the same page?

163
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,413
What have you got in mind?

164
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:45,940
<i>She killed one of our main leads,
that's correct?</i>

165
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,211
He was a psychopath.

166
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,260
<i>- She was defending herself.
- She stabbed him 15 times.</i>

167
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,602
<i>- Are you saying it was murder?
- That's for lawyers to decide.</i>

168
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,542
She put her life on the line
when she didn't have to.

169
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:01,251
- I'm sure that will weigh in her favor.
- You know what a conviction would mean.

170
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,949
- She'd go away for years.
- Someone has to pay for this.

171
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,188
So you tell me,
who do you want that to be?

172
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:11,877
I'm sending someone over from Justice.
Kristin Smith.

173
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,807
<i>She'll take care of everything.</i>

174
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,361
What do you need from me?

175
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,910
Just open the door
and get out of the way.

176
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,283
We did a sweep, sir.
No trace of any hazardous materials.

177
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:39,090
- Fine. Finish up, get back to base.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,048
- Find Dana yet?
- I think so.

179
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,996
I'm tracking her phone.

180
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,691
Send them to my PDA.

181
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,567
Are you sure that's a good idea?
There could be a reasonable

182
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,136
<i>- explanation...</i>
- You stuck your nose in all this.

183
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,957
Just do it.

184
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,148
- Coordinates are on your phone.
- Thanks.

185
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:05,289
- I'm sending everyone back to CTU.
- What are you going to do?

186
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,814
I'll be there within the hour.
If Hastings asks,

187
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,983
<i>just tell him
I'm following up a lead.</i>

188
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,724
I know Dana means a lot to you,
but do you really think

189
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:16,046
- this is worth going AWOL over?
- She's my fiancee, Arlo.

190
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,429
Jim, I'm taking your vehicle.

191
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,860
Find Owen,
have him take SWAT back to CTU.

192
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:30,444
- Say I'll be right behind them.
- No problem, sir.

193
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:45,330
Is Dana back yet?

194
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:47,747
I don't think so.
Do you need her for something?

195
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,850
Do I need her for something?

196
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:53,320
Yes, Arlo,
she's my chief data analyst.

197
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:55,195
I need her to do her job.

198
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:58,934
You track her down,
and you let me know when you find her.

199
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:01,528
Kristin Smith
from the Justice Department is here.

200
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:03,224
Thank you.

201
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,476
- Rob Weiss brief you?
- Yes,

202
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,216
I have to interview Renee Walker.
I read her statement.

203
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,750
Did it appear to you
that she's guilty of murder?

204
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,888
Mr. Weiss warned me
you might have issues with this.

205
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,622
With hanging a brave woman out to dry?
Yes, I do.

206
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:32,765
There are major discrepancies between
her statement and the forensic evidence.

207
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,996
All I'm asking her to do
is to set the record straight.

208
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,861
I feel it would be prudent
to restrict

209
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,322
- surveillance access to this interview.
- Fine.

210
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,755
I would also like a video record of it
in the event of legal proceedings.

211
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:48,786
Can I ask you to provide that?

212
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,402
Right this way, please.

213
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,276
This is a transcript
of your statement.

214
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,326
You should review it
before you sign it.

215
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,726
- How far out did Jack say he was?
- 15 minutes.

216
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,772
This is Kristin Smith from Justice.
She needs to talk to Renee,

217
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,567
- if you'll excuse us, Chloe.
- Talk to her about what?

218
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:20,610
Now.

219
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,327
Thank you.

220
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:39,867
What's she talk to her?
She was about to sign her statement.

221
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,548
- I already debriefed her.
- She needs to fill in details.

222
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,665
- I already did it.
- I know that you protect her.

223
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,054
- I respect that.
- Than let me sit in.

224
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,222
Why?

225
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,033
Was your debrief
not a full and honest?

226
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,156
We've nuclear materials
in the hands of terrorists.

227
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:57,688
I need you back at your desk
focused on that.

228
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:00,887
Yes, sir.

229
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:14,664
Where are we?

230
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,610
A staging area.

231
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,067
It belongs to a businessman
who supports us.

232
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,492
I don't want to delay too long.

233
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,591
We need to find another way
to get the rods out of the country.

234
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,324
You heard what the American said
to Bazhaev's son.

235
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:30,930
- They know what we doing.
- So we need to move quickly.

236
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:33,391
The Americans are not stupid.

237
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:37,117
If we go near any airfield
or harbor now,

238
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:40,273
the radiological detectors
will spot us.

239
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:11,804
Who are they?

240
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:14,309
These are men I've recruited.

241
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,434
- Our men.
- What are they doing here?

242
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:19,353
To unload the rods.
We need to get rid of the van.

243
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,091
And then what?

244
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:22,857
You should rest.

245
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,317
I don't need to rest.

246
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,193
I need to know what we're doing.

247
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,358
We can't get the rods
out of the country.

248
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,162
Let's use them.

249
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:37,889
Use them?

250
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:38,914
How?

251
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,182
As a weapon.

252
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,089
A radiological bomb.

253
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,774
We'll show the Americans
how strong we are.

254
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:48,716
Show them?

255
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,678
Are you out of your mind?

256
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,400
If we use the rods against them,

257
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,357
they will destroy our country.

258
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,852
They'll bomb us, invade.

259
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,188
And if we do nothing,
they'll do it anyway.

260
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:05,876
That's what this peace treaty
with your brother is all about.

261
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:09,193
They're trying to turn us
into another corrupt,

262
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,566
Mid-East regime
with your brother as dictator,

263
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,407
kept in power by American guns

264
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:14,686
and money.

265
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,453
Isn't that
what we came together to prevent?

266
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,466
Is there no other way?

267
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:34,946
America will always be our enemy.

268
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,392
Remember...

269
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:44,480
even a giant can be toppled
by a single stone.

270
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,797
We need to make them fear us.

271
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,207
I'm with you.

272
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:44,206
<i>You said in your statement
that you killed Vladimir Laitanan</i>

273
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,250
<i>in self-defense.</i>

274
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:48,031
Is that correct?

275
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:49,712
Yes, it's in my statement.

276
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:54,011
What I didn't see was any mention
of your history with Laitanan.

277
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:56,594
You did have a history.

278
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,679
I worked an undercover operation

279
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:01,223
with the FBI.
Laitanan was the target.

280
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,783
During the course of that operation,
you had to get close to him.

281
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,109
He became obsessed with you.

282
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:09,771
He tried to rape you.

283
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,985
But you were able to stop him.

284
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,100
I fought him.

285
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,490
Put me in the hospital
with two broken ribs.

286
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,116
That's in there, too.

287
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:22,406
You were able
to fight off a stronger, violent man.

288
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:24,809
It's impressive.

289
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:29,755
But this time when he attacked you,
you didn't fight him off.

290
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:31,894
I couldn't.

291
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,757
His hands around my neck
trying to strangle me.

292
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:37,807
I understand.

293
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,508
You thought
he was going to kill you.

294
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,056
You were in fear.

295
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:50,523
What happened next?

296
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,190
He was choking me.

297
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:57,738
I stabbed him.

298
00:19:58,355 --> 00:19:59,655
In self-defense?

299
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:05,055
You stabbed him in self-defense...

300
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,129
15 times.

301
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,770
15 times.

302
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:12,837
The first blow alone

303
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,306
could have stopped him,

304
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:16,477
<i>but you didn't stop.</i>

305
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:22,650
Look at me, Renee.

306
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,977
You were an investigator for the FBI.
One of the best they had.

307
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,394
Put yourself
on my side of the table.

308
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,146
Look at what I'm looking at.

309
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:36,912
There's a dead body.

310
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:41,571
On the one hand,
you saying you acted in self-defense.

311
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,001
On the other, I have these.

312
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:47,304
Evidence of a sustained
and furious assault

313
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:49,165
with clear intent to kill.

314
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,405
As an investigator, you know
which version is true, don't you?

315
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:57,398
I acted in self-defense.

316
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,505
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

317
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:07,771
You used an operation

318
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:10,295
of unparalleled importance
to seek revenge

319
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,755
against a target without any regard

320
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,107
- for the final outcome.
- He attacked me first.

321
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:17,401
I'm well aware of your sacrifice

322
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,223
<i>in service to this country,</i>

323
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:23,053
<i>but I do not think
that it is fair or right</i>

324
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:24,848
<i>that CTU should be taken down</i>

325
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,094
because you used this operation
to seek out your own vendetta

326
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:29,569
against Laitanan.

327
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:33,668
I looked at your file.

328
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,085
This isn't the first time
you lost control.

329
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,299
You almost killed

330
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,556
Alan Wilson.

331
00:21:43,756 --> 00:21:46,179
That's why you got fired
by the FBI, isn't it?

332
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:55,982
I can see what this is doing to you.

333
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,429
It is tearing you up inside.

334
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:02,733
Let it out.
Tell me the truth.

335
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,638
You killed Laitanan

336
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:08,411
because the thought of him
touching you again was intolerable.

337
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,658
Do the right thing here.

338
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,712
That's what happened, isn't it?

339
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:28,855
Is that right?

340
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:44,822
Put him into holding.

341
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,199
- No phone calls.
- I would like to see my son's body.

342
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:48,826
We haven't found him.

343
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,635
- What's wrong?
- It's about Renee.

344
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,581
She's being questioned again.

345
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,914
- You already completed the debrief.
- I did. Hastings ordered it.

346
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,377
He called in some woman
from the Justice Department.

347
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:02,305
- Where's Renee now?
- She's in medical.

348
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:04,756
Can you get eyes in that room?

349
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,877
He cut off all access.

350
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,570
What is going on?

351
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:11,934
They're setting her up to take the fall
for the failure of this mission.

352
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:29,314
Sorry. No one's...

353
00:23:37,274 --> 00:23:39,127
They're setting you up.
Don't say nothing.

354
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,795
- Too late.
- What you're doing?

355
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,213
Get out of here.

356
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,299
How dare you?

357
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,969
After everything she sacrificed.

358
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,916
After everything she's lost.

359
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:52,303
Have you no decency?

360
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,619
This is over.

361
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:01,837
Hands in the air.
Do it now!

362
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:06,049
You better put that down
or you're going to get hurt.

363
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:10,525
It's all right.
Go.

364
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:16,648
Hands in the air.

365
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:35,725
Do you have what you need

366
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:37,731
to turn the rods into a bomb?

367
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:40,894
We're gathering materials.

368
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,952
Must be difficult
at such short notice.

369
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,875
Explosives, no.

370
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Detonator?

371
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,066
We're working on it.

372
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,058
I might know somebody.

373
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:56,732
A professor in the city.

374
00:24:57,174 --> 00:24:59,092
With expertise in electronics.

375
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:01,598
- You sure he can be trusted?
- Yes.

376
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:03,001
He will help.

377
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:04,879
He will do whatever I ask.

378
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:07,214
But still...

379
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:09,841
I will bring this up very carefully.

380
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:12,762
I need to talk to him in private.

381
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:16,387
Very well.

382
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,328
There's a phone in the office.
Ali will take you.

383
00:25:46,574 --> 00:25:48,024
What is the target?

384
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,257
Is that decided?

385
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,528
So many targets in New York.

386
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:57,622
It will be hard to choose.

387
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,405
It was Farhad.
He escaped.

388
00:26:32,143 --> 00:26:33,143
Find him!

389
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:34,924
Now!

390
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:55,858
Cuffs off.

391
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,835
Give us the room.

392
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:04,790
Sit down.

393
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,875
I'll stand.

394
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,462
This is the new CTU.
You hang your own.

395
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:11,943
If you mean Renee Walker,
we're asking some questions.

396
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:15,009
- Standard procedure.
- It's a debrief, which completed.

397
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:18,471
But instead, you've got some hack
from Justice trying to initiate

398
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,973
- a criminal prosecution.
- We're establish the facts.

399
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,600
You're trying to save your ass.

400
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:27,002
I was there when you askeher
for her help.

401
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:29,357
And she gave it to you,
and we acquired the target.

402
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,777
This is how you pay her back.

403
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:35,310
I'm not going to let you do this.

404
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:38,646
- I'll call the White House first.
- They knows.

405
00:27:38,771 --> 00:27:40,242
Rob Weiss sent that woman.

406
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:42,745
Maybe I wasn't clear.
I'd call the president.

407
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:44,789
Good luck, I think the president

408
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:46,942
takes murder pretty seriously.

409
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,919
My recollection?
She prosecuted her own daughter.

410
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,442
I'm not asking.

411
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,067
Sit down.

412
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,563
- Sorry.
- We're busy.

413
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:12,400
I've got Farhad Hassan on the line.

414
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,152
The voice prints match.

415
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,148
- Can you tell where he is?
- No. He's on a secure line.

416
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:19,853
Can I just put him through?

417
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,329
Mr. Hassan.

418
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,170
<i>This is Brian Hastings,
director of CTU.</i>

419
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,042
There are people chasing me.

420
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,795
- They've the rods.
- I thought you had the rods.

421
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:35,852
No more.
They turned against me.

422
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,467
They have their own plan...
an attack on New York.

423
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:41,345
An attack on New York?
When, exactly?

424
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:42,668
<i>Soon.</i>

425
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:43,669
Very soon.

426
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,135
- Who are these people?
- IRK operatives working in USA.

427
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,227
I need names.

428
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,563
Just get me out of here.

429
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:52,860
<i>I'll tell you everything I know.</i>

430
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:55,108
We'll get you out.
I give you my word.

431
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,437
Now, where are you?

432
00:28:57,464 --> 00:28:59,248
Forest Hills.

433
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,013
Some kind of boat warehouse.

434
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:04,416
Hurry. I'm injured.

435
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,413
- They're hunting me.
- Hold on and keep this line open.

436
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:11,042
- What do you want?
- Pinpoint his location and get me Cole.

437
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,919
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

438
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,670
His team came back.
He didn't.

439
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,568
Owen said he was following a lead.

440
00:29:16,784 --> 00:29:19,306
All right. Get me Owen.
Tell him he's going to be leading.

441
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,781
- Owen? Are you sure?
- Just do it, Chloe.

442
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:31,049
They'll take you down
and process you.

443
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,314
I want you out of this building.

444
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,170
Fine.

445
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:06,697
Come on.
What's the hurry?

446
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:09,255
What's the hurry?
Your friend's a total freak show.

447
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,041
I know, but come on.

448
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:12,166
Don't go.

449
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:13,698
I'll make it up to you.

450
00:30:14,474 --> 00:30:16,649
At least let me give you
a ride back into town.

451
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:17,929
We'll walk.

452
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,935
Night, ladies!

453
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,282
- Gonna take a leak.
- All right.

454
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:11,321
Why are you here?

455
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:14,999
You're asking me that?
We're in an operation. You can't leave.

456
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:16,572
I can explain.

457
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:18,009
You can explain later.

458
00:31:18,134 --> 00:31:20,061
Right now,
I'm taking you back to CTU.

459
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:21,519
We can deal with this

460
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:24,133
- after we secure the materials.
- It's not what you think.

461
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:27,261
- What do I think?
- I am not sleeping with him.

462
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,971
Save it.
I saw the pictures.

463
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:30,306
What pictures?

464
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,349
Get in.

465
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,684
- I am not leaving!
- Why the hell not?

466
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:35,991
Because if I leave,
this will never end.

467
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:37,271
What will never end?

468
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,446
- You do not understand.
- Then make me understand, damn it!

469
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:42,652
I can't.

470
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:43,884
Try.

471
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,071
We don't have a lot of time.

472
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:19,738
So you better start talking.

473
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:25,688
My name is not Dana Walsh.

474
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:29,485
It's Jenny Scott.

475
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,821
- You find Farhad?
- Still looking.

476
00:32:55,946 --> 00:32:57,446
I injured him badly.

477
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,820
He won't get far.

478
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:01,071
We don't know
who he might have contacted.

479
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,483
I'll be traveling with the rods
to a secure location.

480
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,359
Do you want me to come in?

481
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:06,727
You stay here,

482
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:08,389
and you find him.

483
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:29,634
It's a six-acre warehouse complex
in Forest Hills.

484
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:31,883
Farhad is in one of these buildings.

485
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:33,908
The rods must be there, too.

486
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,724
Drones are airborne,
but they won't have eyes for 12 minutes.

487
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,428
- And the police?
- They're redirecting their resources,

488
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:42,159
but it's a big area,
it's gonna take a while to cordon off.

489
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,528
You wanted to see me, sir?

490
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,707
In the absence of Agent Ortiz,

491
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:49,158
I assume you're ready
to take charge of the operation.

492
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:51,886
- Three units standing by.
- All right. I'll walk you out.

493
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:54,617
- There's a lot of pressure on you.
- I can handle it, sir.

494
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,619
Talk me through it.
What's the attack grid?

495
00:33:56,821 --> 00:34:00,221
Our working theory's that the materials
are still in the proximity of Farhad.

496
00:34:00,346 --> 00:34:03,261
Teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked
with locating and securing the rods.

497
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:06,634
- What about Team Charlie?
- They're responsible for the evac.

498
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,721
A standard urban search-and-rescue...
we're in, we're out.

499
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,060
Nothing standard about it.

500
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:14,821
Wait here.

501
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:24,146
You've got something to say.

502
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,446
Think about it.

503
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:28,690
The people that are chasing Farhad
know they've got a big security problem,

504
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:30,583
so by the time your men get there,

505
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,533
those fuel rods will be long gone.

506
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:34,552
You're down
to one team covering Farhad?

507
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:36,993
- What if they run into resistance?
- What if they do?

508
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,478
At that point, you shoot
at people with a intel value

509
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:40,913
than the man you'll save.

510
00:34:41,136 --> 00:34:44,259
Agent Owen knows the priority
is to take all hostiles alive.

511
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:46,794
Under fire?
No assignment's more difficult.

512
00:34:47,143 --> 00:34:48,838
Agent Owen has my full confidence.

513
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:53,676
If that were true,
you wouldn't be talking to me.

514
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,471
You offering to bring in Farhad?

515
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:02,476
If you drop the criminal investigation
against Renee Walker.

516
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:05,924
Look,
I know you don't want to prosecute her.

517
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:07,857
I can be your out.

518
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,611
I hear what you're saying,
but I can't help you, Jack.

519
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,327
I've sat in that chair before.

520
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:19,370
The chair you're sitting in now.

521
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,162
I know what it's like.

522
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,832
There's a lot of demands on you,
many of them unreasonable.

523
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,370
But the people that last here,
the ones that mattered...

524
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,297
they knew when to say no.

525
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:34,008
It's the White House,
you don't say no.

526
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,183
You are the head of CTU...

527
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,638
you have more juice than you think.

528
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:40,765
Especially
with a nuclear weapon in play.

529
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,688
If we do this, Jack,
it's not for one rescue operation.

530
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:50,767
It's still this whole thing
is over and done.

531
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:54,884
You want Renee freed up,
you're not in and out anymore.

532
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:57,392
I want you in with both feet.

533
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,290
Deal.

534
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:08,229
Deal.

535
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:16,479
I found an NYPD evidence warehouse
in Queens

536
00:36:16,604 --> 00:36:19,863
with $120,000
from a drug bust just sitting there.

537
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:24,016
It was only a matter of getting them
in and out between patrols.

538
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:27,520
Wait,
you actually committed a robbery?

539
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:32,184
Put yourself in my place, Cole.

540
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:35,718
Kevin was going to tell Hastings
I'm a convicted felon.

541
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,758
He was going to ruin my life.
What would you have done?

542
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:39,883
Not this.

543
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:45,037
Kevin promised...
that if I went along,

544
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:47,200
he would never bother me again.

545
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:49,076
Let me guess.

546
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,960
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain.

547
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,821
That's why you're here, isn't it?

548
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:00,972
What do you mean?

549
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:03,306
What's in your hand?

550
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:17,403
- You were going to kill them.
- I don't know.

551
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,405
You were going to shoot them
in cold blood.

552
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,960
Cole, listen to me.

553
00:37:22,383 --> 00:37:23,644
I was wrong.

554
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:26,095
I see that now, but I was scared.

555
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,633
I thought
that I was doing this for us.

556
00:37:29,758 --> 00:37:31,167
For us? Are you crazy?

557
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,389
I love you, Cole.

558
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:41,306
Don't say another word.

559
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,474
Not one more word.

560
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:47,415
Cole, where are you going?

561
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,098
Stay in the truck.

562
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:51,494
Cole, don't do this.

563
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,777
Please, I am begging you.
This is my problem, not yours.

564
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:58,945
Stay back.

565
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:01,591
What?

566
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,463
Go for it.

567
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,756
I have to deal with one of you.

568
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:23,678
You got the wrong address.

569
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:25,203
Do I?

570
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:26,722
I don't think so.

571
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:31,852
- You should tell us what you want.
- Shut up and listen.

572
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:34,272
Come on.
Let's just get out of here.

573
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,989
I thought you looked familiar.

574
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:46,023
Looky here, Nick.

575
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:47,926
It's soldier boy.

576
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:50,024
No kidding.

577
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:51,915
You know,

578
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:55,610
it's a shame that you and I
can't go grab a beer sometime.

579
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:57,321
You know, just the two of us.

580
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,698
I'm sure
we'd have a lot to talk about.

581
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,508
I said shut up.

582
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:05,469
The way I see it,

583
00:39:05,786 --> 00:39:07,586
you guys have two choices.

584
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:08,846
One:

585
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,621
you go back to prison for grand larceny
and aggravated assault.

586
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,229
I go back to prison,
she goes back to prison.

587
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,774
I think
she's prepared to live with that.

588
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,219
Choice number two:

589
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,588
I let you walk.

590
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:26,282
You keep your 100 grand...

591
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,100
or what's left of it...

592
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,739
and you go back
to wherever it is you came from.

593
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:34,373
That's it?

594
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:35,625
That's it.

595
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:39,337
But if I ever see you
in this city again...

596
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:42,590
if I even hear about you
crossing the state line,

597
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:45,468
I'll skip the formalities

598
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:47,554
and kill you myself.

599
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,391
Do we have a deal or not?

600
00:39:58,494 --> 00:39:59,694
We got a deal.

601
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:02,423
Better be sure.

602
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:06,392
I don't want to see
either one of you ever again.

603
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,247
- What are you doing?
- Going after him.

604
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:29,566
Why?

605
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,528
We get rid of him,
we're right back in business with her.

606
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:33,838
Come on, man.

607
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:36,310
We got what we came for.

608
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,162
We got more.

609
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,357
Now, let's just...
let's not push our luck.

610
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:42,678
All right?

611
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,310
Come on, all right?

612
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:46,239
We're just getting started.

613
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,523
We're done.
You got me?

614
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:06,998
What you did back there,

615
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:09,838
- I'll never forget it.
- Let's just get back to CTU.

616
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:11,304
Cole, I'm serious.

617
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Thank you.

618
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:04,375
I'm sorry.

619
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:09,753
I shouldn't have come back.
