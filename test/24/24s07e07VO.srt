1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,700
Previously on 24

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,260
That was Bob Cornell at NSA.

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,260
They've detected
another firewall breach.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,400
There's been another attack?

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,160
Not yet,but they believe the
CIP device is being utilized.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,930
We have to assume Dubaku is
initiating another attack.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,500
- Madam President.
- What is it,Tim?

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,930
I've just been forwarded
a scrambled call.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,200
It's from colonel Dubaku.

10
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:34,770
He's demanding to
speak with you.

11
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:36,085
The deadline for your forces

12
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,757
To begin their
withdrawal has passed.

13
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:38,983
Go to the window.

14
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,153
See what you have done.

15
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:43,680
Comply with my demands
within the hour,

16
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:45,913
Or 10,000 more
Americans will die.

17
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:50,752
She's on her way up.

18
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,351
I'll call you when it's done.

19
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:54,880
Mr. Taylor,are you okay?

20
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:08,451
Audio forensics cleaned
up the recording.

21
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,653
Walker is extraneous.

22
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,483
Kill her before you get here.

23
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,013
Larry,I don't think
it's worth it.

24
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,050
There's nothing here.

25
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:17,113
All right. Fine,

26
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,550
Help Janis coordinate with NSA.

27
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:19,683
I'm sorry about renee.

28
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:20,880
She was a good agent.

29
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:23,181
We don't know that
she's dead yet!

30
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:24,983
I've devoted my
life to the Bureau

31
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,480
And you just expect
me to believe

32
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,301
That the entire government's
been corrupted.

33
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,582
Not all of them.

34
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,680
But until we find out
who,we can't trust anyone.

35
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:34,143
And the four of you really
think you can stop this?

36
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:36,052
We have to.

37
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:37,681
It's as simple as that.

38
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:39,503
Dubaku wants you and your wife.

39
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:40,453
That's the deal.

40
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,580
You're asking us
to risk our lives

41
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:44,513
To be delivered into
Dubaku's hands.

42
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,151
Listen to him,Ule.

43
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,112
But how can we trust this man?

44
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:49,151
Because

45
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:51,311
He has no reason to lie.

46
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,511
How are you doing,Tony?

47
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:53,551
All right.

48
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:54,812
Where's Emerson?

49
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:55,811
He's dead.

50
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:56,982
You want Matobo or not?

51
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,080
You got what you came for.

52
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:09,252
Now,get the hell out of here.

53
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:10,710
Did everything go smoothly?

54
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,710
We have the Matobos,that's
what matters.

55
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:15,083
I heard about the
planes on the radio.

56
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:17,450
The White House still
has not complied.

57
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you intend to do?

58
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:20,880
Exactly what we promised.

59
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:21,913
We're ready,sir.

60
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:23,210
Where's the target located?

61
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:24,910
Kidron,Ohio.

62
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:26,950
- Population? - 30,000.

63
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:28,213
Casualties will be high.

64
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:30,783
Begin.

65
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,880
Larry.

66
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:45,983
We think this is the truck
the Matobos were abducted in.

67
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:48,401
Where was this image taken?

68
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:49,403
Near Northwoods Airfield.

69
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:50,550
Were you able to track it?

70
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:51,583
Not beyond this sector.

71
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,542
But they were heading
east on Mckinley Avenue.

72
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:54,773
All right.
Make sure the vehicle i.d.

73
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,510
Is disseminated to
all search teams

74
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:58,052
- And local agencies.
- Yes,sir.

75
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,783
- Larry,I think I found something.
- Yeah?

76
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,452
I've been working NSA,trying
to back-trace the CIP attack

77
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:04,810
That took down the two planes.

78
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,551
And I found a code fragment

79
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,883
Which I think could be residue
from the CIP intrusion.

80
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,942
I'm running a pattern
match right now.

81
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:11,901
With any luck at all,

82
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,441
We may be able to anticipate
where in the infrastructure

83
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:15,551
They're targeting next.

84
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,611
And I need Sean.

85
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:18,313
Janis,I don't want
to waste personnel

86
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,421
On some wild-goose chase.

87
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:21,472
Dubaku's threatened to
kill 10,000 more Americans

88
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:22,611
in the next 30 minutes.

89
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:23,511
I understand that,

90
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:25,671
and I will drop it the
minute it feels cold.

91
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,743
All right,I'm going to brief the
White House. Keep me in the loop.

92
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,813
Sean.

93
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,983
Are you sure he's up to
running this operation?

94
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:38,983
- Larry's fine. - Is he?

95
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:41,313
You're the one who told
me about him and Renee.

96
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,310
This has got to be
hitting him pretty hard.

97
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,982
If I don't think
Larry can do his job,

98
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,381
I'll let you know,all right?

99
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:50,513
In the meantime,I need you
to open up a fresh socket.

100
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,883
You've reached
Agent Brian Gedge.

101
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,011
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

102
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,911
Agent Gedge,

103
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,310
I expected to hear
from you by now.

104
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,481
It's urgent that I speak
with the first gentleman

105
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:20,983
as soon as possible.

106
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:24,681
Call me back,Agent Gedge.

107
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,410
This is extremely important.

108
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:28,452
Yes?

109
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,110
Larry Moss with the FBI.

110
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,381
Where are we,Larry?

111
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:32,441
We've I.D.'d a vehicle

112
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:34,643
that we believe was used
in the Matobos' abduction.

113
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,103
We're still trying
to track it down.

114
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:37,621
And how long is
that going to take?

115
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,971
I wish I could tell you,sir.
I don't have a time frame.

116
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,881
That's not good enough,Larry.

117
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,651
Unless you get some results,we're
going to get hit again.

118
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,281
A lot of people
are going to die

119
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:47,610
if you don't find Dubaku.

120
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,952
With all respect,sir,

121
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,711
I don't need to be
told what's at stake.

122
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,311
We're giving everything we can.

123
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:54,012
One of our agents
has given her life.

124
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,683
Yes,I was told about that.

125
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:58,783
I'm... I'm sorry.

126
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,710
I'll call you the minute
we have something.

127
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,781
We'll be waiting.

128
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,310
God....

129
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:14,710
The Matobos have been
taken into a building.

130
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:16,213
546 Adams.

131
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:18,421
- Okay,pull up the stats
on that address.  - On it.

132
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:21,653
It's the Ritter
building,four stories high.

133
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:22,961
The building is two years old.

134
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:24,903
- Give me the security specs.
- Give me a minute.

135
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:27,380
We're coming up on it.

136
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:30,481
I'm going to need your help.

137
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:56,282
I see you've chosen a target.

138
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,283
The Boyd Chemical
Plant near Kidron,Ohio.

139
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,010
The CIP device has enabled us

140
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,881
to take control
of the main tank.

141
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:05,310
We're about to cause the
primary safety valves to fail.

142
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:15,452
Do you remember the last
time we saw each other,Ule?

143
00:06:16,986 --> 00:06:19,950
It was at a state dinner
in your residence.

144
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:23,115
We shared an excellent
bottle of wine.

145
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,787
I offered my hand in friendship

146
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,613
and you... slapped it away.

147
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,553
You gave me an ultimatum...

148
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,580
to be the puppet
for your military.

149
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:34,681
You could have had a long
and prosperous career

150
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:35,812
as prime minister.

151
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:37,902
But now you're going
back to Sangala

152
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,183
as a traitor to your people.

153
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:40,950
I am prime minister.

154
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:42,780
I was elected by the people.

155
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:44,811
It's you and Juma
who are the traitors.

156
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:52,450
No.

157
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,612
We brought order to Sangala,

158
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,783
but you are trying to destroy

159
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:58,553
everything that we've built.

160
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,652
You'll be taken back
to Sangala,Ule,

161
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:07,013
And you will give General Juma

162
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,313
the names of all your
fellow traitors.

163
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,351
I will never do that.

164
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,313
Never.

165
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:21,352
Hmm...

166
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:24,480
Believe me,you will.

167
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:27,553
Take them.

168
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:36,683
Any response from
the president?

169
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,412
Not yet.

170
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:40,351
But once she sees
dead Americans

171
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:43,713
lying in the street,she
will be less stubborn.

172
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,960
I'm inside,Jack,approaching
the front desk.

173
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:00,011
Copy that.

174
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,913
Are the Motobos still
on the third floor?

175
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:04,952
Affirmative,Jack.

176
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,050
They're being moved.
I'm just not sure where yet.

177
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,063
Copy that.

178
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:17,951
Good afternoon.

179
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,941
I'm Agent Walker with the FBI.

180
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,443
I don't have an appointment.

181
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:24,040
But I'm here to see Mr.
Roane of Roane and associates.

182
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:26,053
- I'll let them know you're here. -
Actually,I don't want to be announced.

183
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,633
I'm here on official business.

184
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:28,441
All right.

185
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:30,070
So as far as you're concerned.

186
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:32,090
I was never here,understand?

187
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,091
Yes,ma'am.

188
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:38,950
Past security.

189
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,912
Heading toward the elevator.

190
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,083
We're on our way to
the service entrance.

191
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,962
Chloe,I'm on the third floor.

192
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,093
Law firm is on your left.

193
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,021
On your right is a suite
of offices where Matobo's

194
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:00,932
being held.

195
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:01,952
I see it.

196
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,060
Stairwell's down the
hallway to your left.

197
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,072
Agent Walker,we're at the door.

198
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:34,040
There's one guard outside
the suite,probably armed.

199
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,921
Bill,take the third floor.

200
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:43,043
Wait for my signal.

201
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:49,033
Go on.

202
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:03,933
Chloe,we're on
the fourth floor.

203
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,512
In what used to be
the computer room.

204
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:07,650
- What now? -
In the center of the room.

205
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:09,063
There are two removable panels.

206
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,052
This should give you
access to the crawlspace.

207
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:13,023
Copy that.

208
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:29,062
Okay,we're clear. Let's go.

209
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:50,041
We're in.

210
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,982
I should never have allowed
you to come with me.

211
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,983
It was a mistake.

212
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,043
It was not your decision,Ule.

213
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:14,942
We will be all right.

214
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:18,063
Jack Bauer will be here soon.

215
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,442
Okay.

216
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,063
We're at the heating unit.

217
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,290
Okay,Jack,there's an airduct

218
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,041
leading off that unit.
Do you see it?

219
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,923
Yeah.

220
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,412
Follow that for about 30 yards

221
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,042
until you see an
electrical junction.

222
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,952
Make a left,then
another 20 yards

223
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,072
you'll come to the vent.

224
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:39,922
This will give you a view
of the entire floor.

225
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:40,942
And the Matobos?

226
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:42,961
They've been moved
into a adjacent room.

227
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,071
Just off the main area.

228
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,091
Okay,copy that.

229
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,933
Come on.

230
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:49,973
The entire NSA has been
combing the firewall.

231
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:52,402
Searching for the next
CIP device breach.

232
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:54,033
If this were
something,don't you think

233
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,043
They'd already know about it?

234
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:57,030
I can live without your
negativity today,Sean.

235
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:01,042
There it is again,that
same code fragment.

236
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,403
"Kidron,Ohio." What's
in Kidron,Ohio?

237
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,000
Any sensitive installations?

238
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,021
Something Dubaku
might want to hit?

239
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:08,931
I don't know.

240
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:10,910
Homeland has a high-value

241
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:13,042
target database.
I'm cross-checking it now.

242
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:16,991
Okay. Okay,nothing
in Kidron itself.

243
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,421
But in the neighboring
county there's...

244
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,072
- Boyd chemical. -
Boyd chemical. What do they make?

245
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,072
Insecticide. Please
get me that number.

246
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,920
Hello?

247
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,970
This is Janis Gold at FBI.
I need to speak

248
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:37,090
to your plant
manager immediately,please.

249
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,911
Ma'am,as I just stated
I'm with the FBI.

250
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,923
Does that sound vaguely
important to you?

251
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:45,012
Now,connect me to John Brunner.

252
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:52,032
FBI? Uh,yeah,put her on.

253
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:54,980
This is John Brunner.

254
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:55,983
Hello.

255
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,091
Mr. Brunner,this
is Janis Gold,FBI

256
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:00,012
D.C. Bureau.

257
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,283
What can I do for you?

258
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:02,781
We've been tracking
some possible

259
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,041
Breaches in the
government firewall.

260
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:06,082
The firewall's designed
to protect installations

261
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,202
- Like yours... -
I know what it does,honey.

262
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:10,111
Um,we have tracked

263
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,082
And isolated one
of these breaches

264
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:13,251
In the Kidron area.

265
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,880
I need to know are
you experiencing

266
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:16,413
Any problems right now?

267
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,783
As a matter of fact,we're
dealing with one right now.

268
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:21,412
- What is it? -
Three of our safety valves just failed

269
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:22,713
On the primary storage tank.

270
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,701
We're having trouble
resetting them.

271
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:27,113
- What's in that tank?
- Methyl isocyanate.

272
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:29,613
It's concentrated
insecticide,highly toxic.

273
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:31,501
Can you...
what the hell is this all about?

274
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,552
Mr. Brunner,I have reason

275
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,473
To believe that this
is a terrorist attack

276
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,610
On your facility.

277
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:39,912
Terrorist attack?

278
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,352
Yes,sir,I need you to initiate

279
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:42,780
On-site emergency procedures

280
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,110
And stay on this line.

281
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:46,251
Shut down the tank.

282
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:47,881
- What's going on?
- Do it! Do it!

283
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:48,982
My authority.

284
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:53,211
- Damn. - What is it?

285
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,661
- It's not responding. -
What do you mean? Try it again.

286
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,411
Nothing.

287
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:04,150
Pressure in the
primary tank is rising.

288
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:08,381
- Son of a bitch.
- Mr. Brunner?

289
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,552
We cannot shut down
the primary tank

290
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,350
And the pressure is building.

291
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,410
If we cannot stop
this,we are looking

292
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,613
At atmospheric release.

293
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,611
Okay.

294
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:19,782
Get Larry.

295
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,650
Dubaku has targeted
that facility.

296
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:23,313
We need to alert the president.

297
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:28,513
Mr. Brunner,you need to
expel your people right now.

298
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:44,013
All right,Agent
Moss,keep me apprised.

299
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:45,650
I'll speak to the president.

300
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,670
I just received an
interagency alert.

301
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,951
The FBI just discovered
Dubaku's next target.

302
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:51,081
A chemical plant,yeah.

303
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,983
I just got off the
phone with Larry Moss.

304
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:54,411
I need to brief the president.

305
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,552
Has the first gentleman
spoken with the president?

306
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,210
Not yet.

307
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:00,611
I talked to Agent
Gedge 40 minutes ago.

308
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,051
Mr. Taylor is the only person
who can talk the president

309
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,720
Into withdrawing our
troops in Sangala.

310
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:06,670
And that is our best way
to prevent this attack.

311
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:07,810
I know we need him.

312
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:09,283
I'm waiting for a call back.

313
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:11,981
The middle section's still bothering me;
read it again.

314
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:14,451
"Colonel Dubaku and the
Juma regime have killed

315
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:16,350
"countless thousands
of their own people,

316
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,213
"and now hundreds of
our fellow citizens.

317
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:20,713
They deserve your prayers
and your outrage."

318
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,101
I think the word "outrage"
might be too strong

319
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:24,613
If you're trying to convey

320
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:25,751
Calm authority.

321
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:26,962
"outrage" is the only word

322
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,240
To describe how I'm
feeling,and how every person

323
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,572
In this country
will be feeling.

324
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:32,250
The American people
deserve the truth.

325
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,153
Dubaku's already
killed 300 Americans.

326
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,610
God knows what else
he has planned.

327
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,052
Come in.

328
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,081
Could you excuse us,Angela?

329
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:53,180
What is it?

330
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:55,153
The FBI believes
they've detected

331
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,831
Where the next attack
will take place.

332
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:01,152
Dubaku's infiltrated
a chemical plant

333
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:02,713
Just outside of Kidron,Ohio.

334
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:04,883
He's causing the pressure
on the facility's

335
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:06,383
Primary tank to go critical.

336
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:08,482
If the tank erupts,over
3,000 gallons

337
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:11,172
Of methyl isocyanate will be
released into the atmosphere.

338
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:13,150
Given the prevailing winds,

339
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:15,582
A very large,very toxic cloud

340
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:16,910
Will sweep into town.

341
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,650
Methyl isocyanate

342
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:20,281
is a concentrated insecticide.

343
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,681
Even brief exposure
causes severe lung damage

344
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,682
and chemical burns of the skin.

345
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,740
What's our time frame?

346
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,072
The tank could rupture
in less than 15 minutes.

347
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,713
They've begun evacuating?

348
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,651
We've already contacted
emergency responders

349
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,720
on the ground in Kidron.

350
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,572
It's just not enough time
to get everyone out.

351
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:38,751
Kidron's population's
just over 30,000.

352
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,411
This projection says that

353
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,410
we could lose over 50%?

354
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:48,680
Oh,dear lord...

355
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:51,610
Right now,our only
chance of stopping this

356
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,551
is finding Dubaku
and the CIP device.

357
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:03,110
- You ready? - Yeah.

358
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,950
Quietly.

359
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:06,282
Jack,I just intercepted

360
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:09,251
an FBI alert identifying
Dubaku's next target.

361
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:10,983
A chemical plant
near Kidron,Ohio,

362
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,150
12 minutes from going critical.
There are 30,000

363
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:15,350
people in that town,Jack.
We have to hurry.

364
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:17,150
We'll do as fast as we can.

365
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:20,051
Give me the scope
out of the bag.

366
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:40,953
Turning scope over
to night-vision.

367
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,013
I don't see Dubaku.

368
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,952
We've got Nichols.

369
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:51,882
Three men with
automatic weapons.

370
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:54,583
Three more over at the control
station,most likely armed.

371
00:17:54,758 --> 00:17:56,413
Copy that.

372
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,911
That's Dubaku.

373
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:02,112
We got Dubaku.

374
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:03,512
Chloe,are you seeing this?

375
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:05,582
Yes. The control station
looks like an S-DART

376
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:07,540
It's a really
powerful processor.

377
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:10,250
- It could be driving the CIP device.
- Copy.

378
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:12,681
NSA's classified
infrastructure team

379
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:15,253
- is trying to plug the firewall breach.
- Any luck so far?

380
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:17,340
- None so far,but they're staying on it.
- They have less than

381
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:18,872
- ten minutes left. -
They're aware of that,sir,

382
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:20,612
but they're doing
what they can.

383
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:21,782
Not now.

384
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,110
What's going on at the plant?

385
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,152
I'm on with them now.

386
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:27,512
John? Did you try

387
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:29,251
flashing the memory cards?

388
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:30,680
Three times,honey.

389
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:32,751
We're not in control of
the computer system.

390
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,181
I've already told my people
to get the hell out of here.

391
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,780
Normally,I don't allow people

392
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:38,980
to call me "honey," but we
can discuss that later.

393
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,752
Yeah,well,it sounds like
you need to lighten up.

394
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,351
Good,good.

395
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:45,782
I'm heading to the
primary tank room.

396
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:47,351
I'm going to try to manually

397
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,070
release some of the pressure.

398
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,382
That's not going to stop it.

399
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:52,513
No,but it might buy us

400
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:55,211
a few more minutes so
people can evacuate.

401
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:57,550
I've got a thousand
workers at this facility.

402
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,652
And I am responsible

403
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,813
for their safety.

404
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:04,382
Now look,I need you
to stay on the phone.

405
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,353
- I'm going to need some help.
- Absolutely.

406
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:08,210
- What can I do? -
I don't have access

407
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:10,252
to the override schematics.

408
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,553
See if you can pull up

409
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,553
the operating procedures
for tank one.

410
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:16,182
Yeah,yeah,yeah. I got it.

411
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:18,182
- I got it right here.
- All right.

412
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,250
Now look for the
emergency valve

413
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:22,183
release sequence.

414
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:23,710
Okay.

415
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:25,951
Uh,valve release.
I have it right here.

416
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:29,253
What i need you to do is...

417
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:32,113
This,wait,this procedure
is going

418
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,452
to release the chemical right

419
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,713
into the primary tank room
where you are right now.

420
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:37,852
I know that.

421
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:39,583
I have respiratory gear on.

422
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,010
I'll be okay,just
give me the sequence.

423
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,081
But how long will
that protect you?

424
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:46,813
Don't worry about it,honey.

425
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:50,750
Uh,okay.

426
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:53,352
- Are you looking at the routing board?
- I am.

427
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:54,710
Go ahead.

428
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,750
Set the bus switches

429
00:19:56,918 --> 00:20:00,082
To this sequence
from left to right.

430
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:01,312
Two. Two.

431
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:03,312
Eight. Eight.

432
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:05,353
Seven. Seven.

433
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:06,653
Four. Four.

434
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,581
Three. Three.

435
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:10,811
Done.

436
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:12,750
The secondary flow valve

437
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,453
Should be behind you
and to your right.

438
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:18,413
I need you to turn
that clockwise please.

439
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:29,110
All right. All right,I got it.

440
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,581
Okay,that's one valve down,

441
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:32,911
Three more to go.

442
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:47,711
Pressure inside the tank
is approaching 400 psi.

443
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,410
How long before
the tank ruptures?

444
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,982
Seven minutes.

445
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,181
We've got a problem.

446
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:53,951
- What is it? - An alert.

447
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,212
Our hidden surveillance
camera on the roof.

448
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:58,552
Almeida and Bauer.

449
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,811
When was this taken?

450
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:01,252
20 minutes ago.

451
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:04,210
I thought you killed
Almeida and Bauer?

452
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:05,682
Damn it! You said this location

453
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:07,872
- Was kept secret from everyone!
- It was.

454
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:09,233
Then what are they doing here?!

455
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:10,901
- I don't know. -
How did they find us?!

456
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:11,981
I don't know!

457
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,752
600 psi and rising.

458
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,050
Disengage the CIP module.

459
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,213
Begin the offload.

460
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,980
What are you doing?
We're almost there.

461
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:30,882
We will continue this attack
from another location.

462
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:34,280
Let's finish this.

463
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:35,350
We can handle them.

464
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:37,213
We need to get out of here now.

465
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:40,951
The CIP module's
disengaged,starting off load.

466
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:42,813
Hey,what the hell is that?

467
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:44,281
What the hell is that?!

468
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,913
What's the matter?

469
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:50,410
The firewall breach
just closed.

470
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:52,410
What?!

471
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:53,683
What are you talking about?

472
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:56,483
No CIP intrusion,the
firewall is secure.

473
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:58,850
How? NSA?

474
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,113
I don't know.

475
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,451
Bring the CIP module.

476
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:03,781
Get Motobo and his wife!

477
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,153
Bill,we should go

478
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:08,171
With the second option
on the assault.

479
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,641
Two-prong attack. You and Tony
come through the main entrance.

480
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:12,110
- We'll go in from here.
- Copy.

481
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:15,112
Give me the C4 out of the bag.

482
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:40,550
Go!

483
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:49,413
Move.

484
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:51,852
Move!

485
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,511
Get the CIP device!

486
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:30,613
Clear!

487
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,351
All clear over here!
Get Dubaku?

488
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:37,913
Negative!

489
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,113
Jack,I've got the CIP device.

490
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:43,852
It's been destroyed.

491
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:45,982
Jack,it's Renee.
The Motobos are safe.

492
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:47,253
I'm taking them to the van.

493
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:48,680
Copy that. I want you

494
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,550
And Bill to do a sweep.
See if you can find Dubaku.

495
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:53,952
I'll cover the south side.

496
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,060
John? John,are you still there?

497
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:10,101
Yeah.

498
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:10,993
John,listen to me.

499
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,490
The terrorists are
out of the system.

500
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:15,002
Please tell me what is
happening right now.

501
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:23,262
Automatic shutdown
mode has kicked in.

502
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:25,060
Pressure's dropping.

503
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:28,462
I think we're
gonna be all right.

504
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,901
Okay,that's great.

505
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:32,503
Now you...
you gotta get out of there right now.

506
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:40,563
John?

507
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,162
I can't make the door...

508
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:46,760
I'm sending the rescue team.

509
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:48,101
A rescue team is on its way.

510
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:49,761
John,please stay with me.

511
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:51,663
Stay with me.

512
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:19,063
Have they found Dubaku?

513
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:20,460
Still searching.

514
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:23,001
First responders are
five minutes away,Jack.

515
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,160
Copy that.

516
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:34,533
Get up.

517
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:38,631
I said get up!

518
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,433
They're coming.

519
00:25:57,607 --> 00:26:00,262
Please don't make me do this.

520
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:03,300
I will go to your home,Michael.

521
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:05,261
I'll make you wife watch

522
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:06,433
As I kill your daughter,

523
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:07,663
And then I will kill her.

524
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,560
So do as I ask.

525
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,961
Save your family.

526
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:32,263
Let me see your hands!

527
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:33,801
It's Latham.

528
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:36,003
Where's Dubaku?!

529
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,402
I'm sorry.

530
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,100
Cover!

531
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,062
Tony! Bill!

532
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:52,533
Yeah! You all right?

533
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,932
Jack?

534
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:55,861
Jack?

535
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:58,533
Jack,can you hear me?

536
00:26:58,706 --> 00:26:59,661
Yeah,yeah,we're okay.

537
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:00,660
What happened?

538
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:03,401
Latham was wired
with explosives.

539
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:05,900
We still don't have Dubaku.

540
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:06,963
What?

541
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:08,960
The CIP device has
been destroyed.

542
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:10,731
I want you to stay
with the Motobos.

543
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:11,931
Make sure they're safe.

544
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:14,422
Jack the police
are almost here.

545
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:16,820
If you get arrested,this entire
operation goes out the window.

546
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,802
- You have to get out of there.
-  Copy that.

547
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:21,232
He's gone.
We need to get back to the safe house.

548
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:22,930
Let's go.

549
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:37,863
Sean,this says both NSA
and homeland have no idea

550
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:40,131
Why the breach at the
Kidron plan was stopped.

551
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:41,231
They're still looking.

552
00:27:41,336 --> 00:27:42,540
We're working on it here also.

553
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:44,450
Janis is coordinating with
a digital forensics team

554
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:45,790
That she sent over
to the plant.

555
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:47,863
This doesn't make any sense.

556
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:49,931
Why... Why would Dubaku
suddenly stop an attack

557
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,230
When he was minutes away from
causing mass casualties?

558
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:54,560
Maybe there was a malfunction
in the CIP device.

559
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,831
No,no,I don't want maybes,all right?
I want answers.

560
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,301
We're doing everything
we can,sir.

561
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:00,500
That's not good enough
right now,is it?!

562
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:02,961
I don't know what
else to tell you,sir.

563
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:05,301
I know you're
upset about Renee,

564
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:08,060
But getting angry at me is not
going to make it go any faster.

565
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:10,431
If you think I'm yelling at
you because of my history

566
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:11,941
With agent Walker,you
are mistaken.

567
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:14,123
There are thousands of
lives at stake here.

568
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:14,790
That's what concerns me.

569
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:18,830
Sorry,sir.

570
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:22,361
I want you and Janis
to work with NSA.

571
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:25,231
Find out where that CIP
device is being used.

572
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:28,131
If we find the
device,we find Dubaku.

573
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:43,963
I appreciate the call.
Thanks a lot.

574
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,930
Janis,Larry wants you
to interface with NSA.

575
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:49,132
See if you can back-trace that
CIP code fragment to its source.

576
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:50,761
I'll try.

577
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:52,801
Who were you talking to?

578
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:55,262
The head of the response
team at the plant.

579
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:56,701
What did he say?

580
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:57,631
Facility's clean.

581
00:28:57,807 --> 00:29:00,452
A trace amount of the chemical
was released,but not enough

582
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,323
To do any damage,and the
site has been secured.

583
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:03,403
That's good.

584
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:04,762
What about the plant manager?

585
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:06,033
John brunner.

586
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,530
Is he okay?

587
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,132
No.

588
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:10,701
Will you do me a favor?

589
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,131
It depends.

590
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:14,002
I'd like to track down Mr.
Brunner's family.

591
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:15,320
I was the last one
to speak with him,

592
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:17,800
And I feel they should
know how brave he was.

593
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,100
I'll see what I can find.

594
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:20,531
Thank you.

595
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:23,302
Janis,before you
start sending flowers,

596
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,782
You need to find out where that
CIP device was being used.

597
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:28,701
I know... I am on it.

598
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:47,462
Cleanup crews are
already on site

599
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:50,152
and we're continuing our
evacuation of a one-mile radius

600
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:51,432
around the chemical plant.

601
00:29:51,608 --> 00:29:52,701
Casualties?

602
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:54,162
There was,in fact,one casualty,

603
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:55,202
the plant manager.

604
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:56,960
13 other workers
are being treated

605
00:29:57,138 --> 00:29:59,400
for chemical burns and
inhalation of toxic fumes.

606
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,061
And there haven't been any other
intrusions in the firewall?

607
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,830
No,ma'am.

608
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:05,661
It appears the crisis
has been averted.

609
00:30:05,768 --> 00:30:06,971
Except that no one's been able

610
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:08,920
to explain how the
firewall break disengaged.

611
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:10,201
Not yet.

612
00:30:10,366 --> 00:30:12,903
The FBI has no idea how it happened...
It just happened.

613
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:15,260
And that's not an explanation.

614
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,691
Perhaps Dubaku was firing
another warning shot.

615
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,860
No,Dubaku's already
down two planes.

616
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:21,661
He's not afraid to
take more lives.

617
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:24,802
In any event,we
should be grateful.

618
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,263
I'm not one to accept good news

619
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:29,131
unless I know where
it comes from.

620
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:33,501
Until we have more answers,I
want to maintain alert levels.

621
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,630
Yes?

622
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:38,101
Madam president,I have
admiral Smith on line two.

623
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:41,500
Put him through. Thank you,Tim.

624
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,230
Admiral?

625
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:47,700
I've been trying to reach agent
Gedge,and he hasn't picked up.

626
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:50,160
Yes,I'm sure I have
the right number.

627
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:52,401
I just spoke to him
over an hour ago.

628
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,163
He said he was outside
Samantha Roth's apartment

629
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,703
waiting for the
first gentleman.

630
00:30:56,867 --> 00:31:00,031
Just find him.

631
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:04,062
I don't care who you
have to pull off shift.

632
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,501
Still can't reach Gedge.

633
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,100
The secret service doesn't
know where he is either.

634
00:31:09,438 --> 00:31:12,563
I need to tell the president.

635
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,782
Maybe you should hold off.

636
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,621
The domestic threat's
been lifted for now

637
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:17,761
and she's on the phone
with admiral Smith.

638
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:22,702
I can't authorize
the air strikes

639
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,701
until our post-invasion
plans are in place.

640
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:29,032
Finding a politically viable
replacement,until that happens,

641
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:32,430
you need to keep your
forces at full readiness.

642
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,963
The joint chiefs are
getting impatient.

643
00:31:35,136 --> 00:31:39,063
Madam president,we need to
talk about your husband.

644
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:44,362
His theory about
your son's death,

645
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,560
He hasn't let it go.

646
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:49,231
What are you talking about?

647
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:52,130
He's been harassing
Roger's girlfriend,

648
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:56,503
accusing her of complicity
in the death of Roger.

649
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,803
Henry and I went over it

650
00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,300
again and again with the FBI,

651
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:00,361
and he swore to me

652
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:02,160
he was past all that.

653
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,893
Well,he's found a private
investigator who's feeding

654
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,000
his conspiracy theory.

655
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,160
Taking advantage of him.

656
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:11,503
Please get henry on the phone.

657
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:14,430
I'm afraid I can't do that.

658
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:17,403
Henry's unreachable.

659
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:20,500
I don't understand.

660
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,000
Agent Gedge hasn't been
answering his phone.

661
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:26,761
Now,I wouldn't get
too worried yet.

662
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:30,231
You're telling me my
husband's gone missing?

663
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:34,432
Secret service has
put out an APB.

664
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:37,703
They're going to Ms.
Roth's apartment.

665
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:42,163
Whatever's going on,I will
find out soon enough.

666
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:51,103
This is a priority order
code Charlie zero Charlie.

667
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,960
We need an immediate
20 on Agent Gedge.

668
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,103
All available field
agents proceed

669
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:59,660
404 Wilkinson drive.

670
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,931
You're making a mistake.

671
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:16,393
Think about it.

672
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:17,263
Shut up!

673
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:18,893
You haven't killed anybody yet.

674
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:20,203
You don't need to do this.

675
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,802
Gedge's plan to frame
me is already blown.

676
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:27,232
If you kill me,

677
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:29,330
they'll know it was murder,

678
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:31,403
And they'll trace
it back to you.

679
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:42,200
Go ahead.

680
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,760
Where's agent Gedge?
I can't reach him.

681
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:46,862
Gedge is dead.

682
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:48,062
What happened?

683
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:50,432
Everything was going
according to plan...

684
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:51,763
But something went wrong.

685
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:54,003
Taylor killed Gedge;
I don't know how.

686
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:56,231
Where's Mr. Taylor now?

687
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:57,600
He's right here.

688
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,730
Don't kill him,bring him to me.

689
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:21,230
Prime minister
Matobo,ma'am,please come with me.

690
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:24,402
Chloe,pull up the Ritter
building on a satellite grid.

691
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:27,362
Look for any sign of
Dubaku leaving the site.

692
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:28,761
We've got to find him.

693
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:31,141
It's going to take me 20
minutes to task the satellite.

694
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:32,653
Then don't waste time
talking about it.

695
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:35,063
Pull up satellite
and traffic cams,

696
00:35:35,238 --> 00:35:36,903
street corners and
metro stations.

697
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:39,391
What's the priority?
I can only do one thing at a time.

698
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,930
- Satellite! - Fine.

699
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:42,431
Bill,we need to rethink this.

700
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:43,763
What do you mean?

701
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,202
You were set up to surveil
an undercover operation.

702
00:35:46,368 --> 00:35:47,363
Your cover's been blown.

703
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:48,663
The police are after us.

704
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,463
We are not equipped to look for
one man in a city of millions.

705
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:53,160
We need additional resources.

706
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:54,330
What are you suggesting?

707
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:56,662
It's time to contact
outside agencies.

708
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,400
- The government? - Yes.

709
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:01,751
I thought you said the
government couldn't be trusted.

710
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:02,890
Right now,we don't
have a choice.

711
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:03,830
It can't be trusted.

712
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:04,932
We can't trust anybody,

713
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:06,391
That's why we're
working on the outside.

714
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:08,200
President Taylor
can be trusted.

715
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,001
I'm not questioning
that,prime minister.

716
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,103
It's the people around
her who can't be trusted.

717
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:14,361
Mr. Buchanan,Jack's right.
We need help.

718
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:15,660
It's too dangerous.

719
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:17,663
We can limit the
flow of information.

720
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:19,750
Prime minister Matobo
can get us past

721
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:21,991
The president's outer circle...
that way,we can at least

722
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:23,251
explain to her why
and what we're doing.

723
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:24,233
I think Jack's right.

724
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,011
We left a lot of clues
in that building.

725
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:27,450
We're vulnerable;
we can't do this

726
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:28,531
on our own anymore.

727
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:30,600
Am I supposed to remain
in hiding with you,

728
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,002
Pretend that my wife and I

729
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:34,060
are still being held
hostage or dead?

730
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:37,673
I need to return
to the white house

731
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:39,921
and help the president save
what's left of my country.

732
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:41,403
Let my husband do this.

733
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,360
Let him call president Taylor.

734
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:45,563
She will listen to him.

735
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:53,702
Bill,you want to find
Dubaku,make the call.

736
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,800
All right.

737
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:06,263
Get me the white house.

738
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:13,261
Representatives from
Boyd Chemical

739
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:14,863
have assured local authorities

740
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:17,003
that the immediate
crisis has passed.

741
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,102
However,this has done
little to calm the nerves

742
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:21,932
of the citizens of Kidron,Ohio,

743
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,601
many of whom have taken shelter
in neighboring communities.

744
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,561
Again,we have
confirmed one fatality

745
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:28,933
inside the plant itself.

746
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:30,561
13 others,all Boyd employees,

747
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:32,920
are being treated at
local medical centers...

748
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:34,460
Yes?

749
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:37,362
Madame president,I have prime
minister Matobo calling for you.

750
00:37:37,537 --> 00:37:38,400
Matobo?!

751
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:39,401
Yes,ma'am.

752
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:40,731
You're tracing it?

753
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:43,230
We tried,madame president,but
it's a secure line.

754
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,131
Put him through.

755
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:47,331
Prime minister?

756
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:48,803
Yes,madame president.

757
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,003
Are you all right?

758
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,830
Thank God my wife
and I are both fine.

759
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:52,902
We were rescued.

760
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,400
By whom?

761
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:55,603
Where are you?

762
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,360
In a safe place.

763
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:01,530
Madame president,you
need to listen to me.

764
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:04,830
The people who rescued us,they
have acquired the CIP device.

765
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:06,300
It has been destroyed,

766
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:09,663
and your country is no longer
under immediate threat.

767
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:12,961
Who are these people,and
tell me how this happened.

768
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:15,101
I will tell you
everything in person,

769
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:17,362
But,uh,this must
happen privately.

770
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:18,661
I must speak to you alone.

771
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,630
Why alone?

772
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:23,502
They will bring me to
you,Madame President.

773
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,301
We will arrive in ten minutes.

774
00:38:25,466 --> 00:38:27,132
I'll be waiting for you.

775
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:31,662
They tried to trace the
call,but the line held.

776
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,332
- Ethan,I need to see you right now.
- Be right there.

777
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:46,460
Yes,Madame President?

778
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:49,530
I just spoke to Prime
Minister Matobo.

779
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,262
What?!

780
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:52,433
He's safe.

781
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:54,032
How? What happened?

782
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:55,652
He'll let us know
when he gets here.

783
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:58,023
He's on his way now.
He wants a private meeting.

784
00:38:58,137 --> 00:39:00,162
Bring him in through
the south entrance,

785
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:02,361
and keep this to as
few people as possible.

786
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:04,531
All right.

787
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:11,833
Jack,I've mapped a route
for you to the white house.

788
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,011
It's mostly side streets,

789
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,491
but there will be
fewer traffic cams.

790
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:16,062
Okay,good. Send it to my phone.

791
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:17,503
We're ready. Let's go.

792
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,961
As soon as we set the vehicle
in front of the building,

793
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:21,500
Agent Walker will
move Mr. Matobo.

794
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:23,002
Jack... Jack!

795
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,500
What?

796
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,332
I'm not going.

797
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:29,352
What are you talking about?

798
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:31,323
If the government gets
their hands on Tony,

799
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:32,501
they'll arrest him.

800
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:34,101
I already told you

801
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:36,933
I did some pretty bad things
before I teamed up with Bill.

802
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:39,062
Tony,take it from me...

803
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:41,162
you need to deal with
the consequences.

804
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:42,960
And believe me,I will.

805
00:39:43,136 --> 00:39:44,860
But not yet.
Not till we get Dubaku.

806
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:46,331
I'm working on a lead.

807
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:48,503
I've got a guy on
Emersons crew

808
00:39:48,665 --> 00:39:50,432
who might have some
intel we can use.

809
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:51,703
Let him do this,Jack.

810
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,563
He's the reason
we got this far.

811
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,431
Fine.

812
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,860
But you give me your word
as soon as this as over,

813
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:02,162
you turn yourself in.

814
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:03,533
We'll stand behind you.

815
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,663
All right,you have my word.

816
00:40:10,105 --> 00:40:12,333
Good luck. Be careful.

817
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:06,103
- Hey. - Hey.

818
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:08,002
I was on my way to
work,so I thought

819
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,131
I'd stop in and see you.

820
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:10,832
I tried calling you earlier.

821
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,302
I'm sorrym,I've been busy.

822
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:14,463
Are you all right?
You look exhausted.

823
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,762
It's just been a long day.

824
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:19,062
Well,I hope you're still
coming over for dinner.

825
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:20,761
I'm making lasagna.

826
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,931
And my sister promises not to
give you any more dirty looks.

827
00:41:25,968 --> 00:41:27,261
You haven't forgotten,have you?

828
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:28,662
No. No.

829
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,932
It's just that I've got
some business to attend to.

830
00:41:31,037 --> 00:41:33,103
Samuel,you work too much.

831
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:35,001
Every time you come
into the diner,

832
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,532
you're always on the phone.

833
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,760
I have to,Maria,

834
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:39,832
So that,one day,I can
finally take you away

835
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:41,563
from that awful place
that you work in.

836
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,530
Well,we met in
that awful place.

837
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:44,800
Don't forget that.

838
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:48,061
- I'll see you later. - Okay.

839
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,002
Go ahead.

840
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,700
Have you got Mr. Taylor?

841
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:07,902
Yes. I'm about
three minutes away.

842
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:10,900
There's a Korean grocer
opposite my building.

843
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:13,202
One of my men will
meet you out back.

844
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:14,400
Bring Taylor inside.

845
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,561
What are you gonna do to him?

846
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,403
Just make sure you
weren't followed.
