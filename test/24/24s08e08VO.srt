3
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:16,049
Our security police have completed
their initial sweep of the capital city.

4
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:19,334
65 known members of the opposition
have been arrested and are interrogated.

5
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:22,647
Have you learned anything?
Were anyone working with my brother?

6
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:23,772
It's too early.

7
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:25,858
Your father is a great man,

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,151
but Farhad's betrayal
has changed him.

9
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,002
What can we do?

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,366
The president says
you may be involved.

11
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,551
He's ordered me to detain you.

12
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:37,036
I'll talk to him.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,455
President Hassan's crackdown

14
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,944
isn't just a response
to the attempt on his life.

15
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,753
There are
unsecured nuclear materials in play.

16
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:49,715
CTU is running an undercover operation
to retrieve them as we speak.

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,168
I've got something.
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

18
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:55,513
A local vice group

19
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,431
just impounded $120,000.

20
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:59,141
I help you do this

21
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,291
and you never call me again.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,426
That's beautiful, man.

23
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:05,101
Absolutely beautiful.

24
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,357
It's a cop.

25
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,317
You're going
to have to slip past him.

26
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,261
- I'm at the warehouse...
- Nick!

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,321
Stop him!

28
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,415
I hear there are materials for sale.

29
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:17,743
Talk straight. What materials?

30
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:19,203
Nuclear rods.

31
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:21,414
Nobody deals in nuclear rods,
nobody.

32
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,581
We've a problem.

33
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,792
Vladimir Laitanan knows about
the fuel rods.

34
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:28,040
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.
Somebody knows something.

35
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:32,299
No one knows, there's no one left.
It's over! What is wrong with you?!

36
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,250
Stop, stop.

37
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:43,812
- They're Russians.
- What are you doing?

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,020
I let them take me.

39
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,615
Tell CTU
to start tracking me from the air.

40
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,483
They'll lead us
to what we're looking for.

41
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,193
I'm unarmed, don't shoot.

42
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,619
We can do business.

43
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:55,740
Where's Jack?

44
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:59,577
The Russians took him. He said
you'd be monitoring him from the air.

45
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,559
We haven't seen anything.

46
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:02,991
<i>Where is he?</i>

47
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,229
Where are you?

48
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,106
Jenny girl!

49
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,066
You would call me
when you got clear.

50
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:33,027
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I forgot.

51
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,651
We got caught up
celebrating our score.

52
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:37,740
<i>Celebrating?</i>

53
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,159
You put a police officer
in the hospital.

54
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:42,776
That wasn't me, that was Nick.

55
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,081
Why do you got
to focus on the negative?

56
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:48,066
We're flush 120 grand.

57
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,962
Why don't you come down here,
have a drink, celebrate with us?

58
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,732
We're at a club
in Jersey City called Starlight.

59
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:56,383
We'll work out your cut.

60
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,303
What cut?
I don't want anything from you.

61
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,487
We're done.

62
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,723
I want you to put my key

63
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,992
in my mailbox

64
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,310
and get out of my life
like promised.

65
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,274
That's not going to happen.

66
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:14,860
What?

67
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:17,728
This is a sweet operation
that we got going here.

68
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:20,130
You getting the access codes

69
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:22,322
- and us pulling the jobs.
- Wait.

70
00:03:23,714 --> 00:03:24,870
We had a deal.

71
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:28,916
You promised me I do this for you
and then you leave me alone.

72
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:32,194
I know and I meant that.

73
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,757
but things change, okay...

74
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:38,851
We can get rich off of this.

75
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,594
You can't do this to me.

76
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,106
Jenny, please...

77
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:45,622
Look, bitch,

78
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,613
you're in this up to your neck.

79
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:49,770
Want your boss
and your boyfriend finding out

80
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,680
you're not who you say you are?

81
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,909
You're gonna be
our golden goose, okay?

82
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,442
What are you doing?
We got a situation.

83
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,288
You need to be on the floor.

84
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:12,126
I heard you, I will be right there.

85
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:13,836
Who was that on the phone?

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,467
None of your business.

87
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:16,881
Actually, it is.

88
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,634
When you sneak away to make phone calls,
making me cover for you,

89
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,721
it becomes my business.
Who was that?

90
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,739
- Kevin?
- How the hell would you...

91
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,476
Are you spying on me?

92
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,986
You want to step out on your fiancé,
it's fine with me.

93
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:35,912
- I've got no love for the guy.
- You don't understand.

94
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:39,111
- I am not cheating on Cole.
- Whatever you want to call it,

95
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,586
tell to your boyfriend
what's going on,

96
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,741
or I will.

97
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:48,444
Our undercover operation
just went south.

98
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:49,914
What's happened?

99
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,355
Jack Bauer was grabbed
by an unknown group of armed Russians.

100
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,857
We think they're the ones
in control of the nuclear rods.

101
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,282
- Are we tracking them?
- We can't.

102
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,640
They're took Bauer through
an underground access.

103
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,835
Without aerial support,
the best we could do

104
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,680
was track them to a drainage junction
near Avenue Y and Ocean.

105
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,091
They must have had a vehicle.
Jack's cell phone was trashed.

106
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:12,770
There has to be something
to help us ID the vehicle.

107
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,617
Tire treads,
transmission fluid, oil residue?

108
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:16,761
There's nothing,

109
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:19,109
- the trail's gone cold.
- What about Walker?

110
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,040
<i>Did she saw these people?</i>

111
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,279
I don't know.

112
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:25,139
Frankly,
she's pretty messed up right now.

113
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,952
- <i>Blaming herself for Jack</i>.
- She should.

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,454
She crippled this operation
when she murdered her contact.

115
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,602
Without Vladimir Laitanan,
we have no lead

116
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,959
to finding Bauer
or the nuclear materials.

117
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,587
Get her back to CTU for debriefing.
I want to know what happened.

118
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,050
You might want to consider
running a psych eval on her.

119
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,412
Count on it.

120
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,596
You were supposed to be
coordinating with NSA,

121
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,081
monitoring chatter.

122
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,643
- I had to take care of something.
- What was so important?

123
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,630
It's my fault.

124
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,232
I asked her to recover a datalog

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,891
I deleted from archives.
I didn't have clearance.

126
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:03,654
I'm uplinking to NSA servers now.

127
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:08,867
All right.

128
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,035
Get on it.

129
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,246
Roll back any chatter
within the last 20 minutes.

130
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,275
Right now that's all we've got.

131
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:17,910
Let me know if something turns up.
I need to brief President Taylor.

132
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,422
Thank you.

133
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,383
Thank me by putting aside
whatever it's that's bothering you

134
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,510
and helping me find Jack.
He's my friend

135
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,840
and he's in trouble.

136
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:44,950
Take him down the hall.

137
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,526
- Where is Vladimir?
- Dead.

138
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,330
So are his men.

139
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:57,913
The German said
they tried to rip him off.

140
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,920
Did he also say how he knows
about the fuel rods?

141
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:29,782
Who are you?

142
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,867
Ernst Meier.

143
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,787
I've been looking for you
to make you an offer.

144
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,208
- You know who I am?
- No.

145
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:40,150
All I know is that there's a man
in the Russian syndicate

146
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,350
who's been trafficking
weapons-grade uranium,

147
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:44,600
specifically U-235 fuel rods.

148
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,465
After the business with Laitanan,

149
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:48,715
these men brought me here,

150
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,773
so I'm just assuming
you're that man.

151
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,381
Where did you get this information?

152
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,350
I represent a consortium
of priva interests.

153
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,977
They intercepted communiqués
within the Islamic republic.

154
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,167
From whom?

155
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,400
Farhad Hassan,

156
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,823
or someone in his camp.
You're doing business

157
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:09,279
with the wrong people.

158
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,450
Who are these people,
the ones you work for?

159
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:17,215
I'm sure you can understand
I'm not at liberty to say.

160
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,800
You should be more concerned
about the deal that they offering you.

161
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:32,094
I'm not interested in your offer.

162
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:33,895
250 million dollars,

163
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,765
half of which
is ready to be wired to you.

164
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,727
The other half you'll receive
upon final acquisition of the rods.

165
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,071
You pose a problem for me.

166
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,166
You show up out of nowhere,

167
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,410
knowing far too much of my business,
yet I've never heard of you.

168
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:59,455
You've never heard of me
because I'm good at what I do.

169
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,553
What I'm concerned about...

170
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,890
is that you're a cop.

171
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,682
I killed 3 people
back at that garage.

172
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,090
Laitanan, I stabbed in the eye.
You really think I'm a cop?

173
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,622
As a child, I saw KGB

174
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:16,305
throw an entire family
off the roof of a building,

175
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:18,941
two of them small children.

176
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,275
I know what cops are capable of.

177
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,355
So I ask you again.
Who do you work for?

178
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,233
I'm sorry, I can't ll you that.

179
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:30,569
Dimitri, work on him

180
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,254
until he's ready to talk.

181
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:35,801
No, we can make a deal.

182
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,086
We can still make a deal!

183
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,549
You've buried your brother's body?

184
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,341
It's Oleg's necklace.

185
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:09,066
You gave it to him
at his confirmation.

186
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:12,945
Keep it.

187
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,159
To remind you of him.

188
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,020
I'm glad you're back.

189
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,644
We may have a problem.

190
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,541
What is it?

191
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:27,776
There is a man down the hall

192
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:29,796
who claims to be an arms broker.

193
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,214
He knows about the nuclear rods.

194
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:36,394
- How could he?
- He says there was a leak

195
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,815
from Farhad's people,

196
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:39,542
but I wonder.

197
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,670
Until I know for certain
who and what this man is,

198
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:47,187
I've stopped the transport of the rods,
redirected to our weigh station

199
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,746
off the Wantagh Parkway.

200
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:51,066
I'm sure
Farhad can't be happy about that.

201
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:54,012
I haven't told him yet.

202
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,242
Perhaps we should tell him together.

203
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:05,773
- How long do you hold him off?
- That depends.

204
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:06,832
On what?

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,373
On how long it takes Dimitri
to break this guy.

206
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,231
Okay, Mr. Policeman.

207
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,518
I'm not a cop.
I swear to you.

208
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,145
Please, don't do this.

209
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,985
Tell me what you know.

210
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,347
We are exhausting
all efforts to ascertain

211
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:55,881
who took Bauer and where.

212
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,383
Until any progress is made,
we just have to hope

213
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:01,847
<i>that Jack can find some way
of salvaging the operation on his end.</i>

214
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,805
What makes you think
he's still alive?

215
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,683
Only the fact that he wasn't killed
at the point of abduction.

216
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,852
I need a realistic assessment.

217
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,355
What are the odds
of finding and securing

218
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,607
these nuclear weapons
within the next hours?

219
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,733
I can't answer.

220
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,403
The longer we're out of touch
with Bauer, the less likely our chances.

221
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:20,349
All right, Mr. Hastings.

222
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,408
Continue to coordinate with my office.
I want updates

223
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,400
- every 30 minutes.
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

224
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,417
I just spoke to General Wasim.

225
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:30,965
He's worried.

226
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,925
Your brother's crackdowns
back home are intensifying.

227
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:37,739
Everyone is being arrested.
Our window of opportunity is closing.

228
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,051
- Why didn't the general call me?
- <i>Perhaps he's losing confidence</i>

229
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,761
in your ability.

230
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:45,418
This is my mission.
My plan!

231
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:46,748
Of course.

232
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:48,850
But we're running out of time.

233
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,911
If your brother dismantles
the opposition,

234
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,716
we'll no longer be able
to reconstitute our nuclear program.

235
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,591
- He won't succeed.
- At this rate, he will.

236
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,986
How much longer must we wait
for the delivery of the uranium?

237
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:01,718
Not long.

238
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,115
The rods should be arriving
within the hour.

239
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,658
Have your men ready.

240
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,399
I'll call you back.

241
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,331
Yes? What is it?

242
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,293
There is a man downstairs who's shown up
to outbid you for the fuel rods.

243
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:18,463
Is this some feeble attempt
to renegotiate terms?

244
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,257
Not at all.
This man, Meier,

245
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,385
claims someone in your organization
tipped him off to our deal.

246
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,091
That's not possible. He's lying.

247
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,139
At any rate,
in light of his appearance,

248
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,266
I'm halting delivery
for the time being.

249
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:32,035
- What? You can't do that.
- It's already done.

250
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,818
I can't take the risk
that we may be exposed.

251
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,851
The longer you delay, the more time
my brother has to crush his enemies.

252
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,902
If he manages to purge
everyone in the military

253
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,362
who opposes him,
the uranium is worthless to me.

254
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,835
That's your concern.

255
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,574
Mine is to make certain this Meier

256
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,827
is not a policeman.

257
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,618
One of my men
is interrogating him now.

258
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,029
That could take hours, even days.

259
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,154
Not days.

260
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,232
I can promise you that.

261
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,461
You promised
to assassinate my brother, too.

262
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,551
Your failure to eliminate him has put me
under enormous pressure, and now,

263
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:03,084
because of your people's inability
to maintain secrecy,

264
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,259
you break our agreed timetable
to suit your needs.

265
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,223
Don't speak to my father that way.

266
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,684
We've honored
every agreement we made

267
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,836
with you,

268
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,562
and shed a lot of blood for it.

269
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:17,689
My father's allowed you to stay here

270
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,485
and hide from the Feds
at great personal risk to our family.

271
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,697
Tell him to put the gun down.

272
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,713
We're not taking
any more of your demands.

273
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,703
Throw him out of here.

274
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:35,415
Let his own people shelter him
if he thinks we're such fools.

275
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:38,752
I'll drive him there myself
if that's what it takes.

276
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,550
It would seem
you have used up our hospitality.

277
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:48,221
Perhaps it's best you join your men
at the rendezvous point

278
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,896
to wait for delivery.

279
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,268
And when will that be?

280
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,054
When I think it's safe.

281
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,679
Not a moment before.

282
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:09,133
Make sure he gets where he's going.

283
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,976
Still got men at the scene.

284
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:40,377
In the meantime, I'll work out
the aerial sweep protocols with Arlo.

285
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,399
What are you doing to find Jack?

286
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,083
Everything we can, Ms. Walker.
Come with me.

287
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,137
Have you checked all the...
the traffic cams, subway routes?

288
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:51,605
You have all this technology...
comm surveillance, satellite tracking.

289
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,036
We're using everything
at our disposal.

290
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:57,831
Then how come you haven't found him yet?
Why don't you have any leads?

291
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,083
The best lead we had is dead.

292
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,098
I know about your suicide attempt.

293
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:06,006
You should have been honest with me.

294
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:08,884
Now O'Brian
will take your statement.

295
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,942
I want to know every detail
about every event

296
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,055
leading up to the death
of Vladimir Laitanan.

297
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,606
When she's done,
take her to medical.

298
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,866
I've ordered
a full psych evaluation.

299
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,455
You can write your statement here.

300
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,422
Hastings blames me
for what happened to Jack.

301
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:45,797
And he's right.

302
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,456
No, he's not.

303
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,382
He shouldn't have said that.

304
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,377
The only reason that Jack was part
of this operation was because of me.

305
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:58,624
So whatever they're doing to him
right now, it's because of me.

306
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,104
I have to find him.

307
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,372
Renee, I know how you must feel.

308
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,175
Just...

309
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,370
Just take one thing at a time.

310
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,915
We have to deal with what you did.

311
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,787
So write your statement.

312
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:20,168
Ill check back with you.

313
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,177
Do you have some time?
I need to talk to you.

314
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,311
Can it wait?
I need to review these protocols

315
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,066
before Arlo distributes them.

316
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,307
I've got it covered.

317
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,685
Go talk to your girlfriend.

318
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:53,308
What's up?

319
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,662
You all right?

320
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:55,887
No, I'm not.

321
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,684
I have a big problem.

322
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:02,484
And it's the reason
why I've been acting kind of weird

323
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:03,998
the past few days.

324
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:12,007
If you're calling off the engagement,
you couldn't have picked a worse day.

325
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:15,907
No, I would never do that.

326
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Good.

327
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,055
So what's bothering you?

328
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,858
There are things about my past
that I haven't told you.

329
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:26,487
I'm listening.

330
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:34,735
I'm sure I haven't told you
everything about my past either.

331
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,666
I don't care what happened
before I met you.

332
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,910
All that matters is now
and what we have to look forward to.

333
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:45,331
I think that's all
that matters, too.

334
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,649
So what are you so worried about?

335
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:51,921
I don't want to lose you.

336
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:54,758
I'm not going anywhere.

337
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:57,969
Excuse me.

338
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,909
Mr. Hastings needs to see you.

339
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,585
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- No. Go.

340
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,769
- Hastings can wait.
- So can this.

341
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:07,844
Talking to you has helped.

342
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:09,773
I think I know
what I need to do now.

343
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:12,072
You sure?

344
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:18,031
Maybe later you tell me
what this is all about.

345
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,801
Who do you work for?

346
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,643
Who else knows about the fuel rods?

347
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:50,836
Everybody has a limit.

348
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:52,690
Don't worry,

349
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:54,749
I'll find yours.

350
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,823
You're working with the police.

351
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,032
Admit it!

352
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,410
Tell me and the pain will stop.
Who else knows?

353
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,157
I told you...

354
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm not a cop.

355
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:12,919
Please.

356
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,438
I'm just a businessman.

357
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:16,506
Please.

358
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,258
Who do you work for?

359
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:22,028
I'm an independent contractor.

360
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,313
I couldn't even tell you
if I wanted.

361
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:25,438
Please.

362
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:27,874
We'll see.

363
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:37,589
Wake up.

364
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:40,697
I said, wake up.

365
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,250
I told you
I didn't want to be disturbed.

366
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,154
<i>Your daughter is still demanding
to see you, Mr. President.</i>

367
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,872
She refuses to leave.

368
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:06,908
Very well. Send her in.

369
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:13,751
Kayla, my love,

370
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm in a crisis,
so unless it's an emergency...

371
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,575
It is an emergency.

372
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,673
We need to talk about
you having Tarin arrested.

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,250
Tarin has been taken to the embassy

374
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:27,999
to help clarify a few questions,
strictly routine.

375
00:22:28,124 --> 00:22:30,473
I know you believe
he's been working against you.

376
00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:32,976
What I don't understand is why.

377
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,186
He refused to follow my orders.

378
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:40,544
You asked him to arrest
the family of one of your delegates.

379
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,669
A man you considered a friend.

380
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:45,844
Kayla, this is a matter of state,
it doesn't concern you.

381
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,569
It doesn't make sense.

382
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:49,380
Tarin was in the car with you...

383
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,996
if the assassination attempt successed,
he would've been killed, too.

384
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,540
The world is full of men
willing to die for their cause.

385
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,669
I know you consider Tarin a friend.
And your loyalty is commendable.

386
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,337
But trust me, I've my reasons.

387
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:03,965
We are more than friends.

388
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:05,574
We're in love,

389
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,261
and have been for almost a year.

390
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,975
You've been carrying on
with this man...

391
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:17,027
behind my back?

392
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:21,107
You say that, after driving mother away
with your infidelity.

393
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:26,561
Please, Father.

394
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:30,324
Don't let Farhad's betrayal turn you
against everyone who cares about you.

395
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,601
I can't think of a better way...

396
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:39,918
to completely infiltrate my life
and influence my judgment...

397
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:42,211
than getting close to my daughter.

398
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:44,012
It's not like that.

399
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,632
You're not to see that man again,
ever.

400
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:49,677
- Father...
- I'm done with this conversation.

401
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:51,949
I need to get back to my work.

402
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,885
What's happening to you?

403
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:20,933
Come on.

404
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,123
Damn it!

405
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,657
<i>I am holding the rods until Meier comes
clean about how he knew of the transfer.</i>

406
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:37,937
<i>If what Meier said is true
about the leak in Farhad's team,</i>

407
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:39,634
<i>it will be dangerous for us.</i>

408
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,007
<i>So we must unload the rods,
finish this.</i>

409
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:44,257
Let them be someone else's problem,

410
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,085
and we erase any evidence.

411
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:50,412
Once Dimitri is finished, I'm satisfied
the German is telling the truth,

412
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,289
I'm going to want
to hand off the rods to Farhad tonight.

413
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:06,480
Keep your men out of sight
along the perimeter.

414
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:09,400
Mikhail and his men
will stay with the cargo.

415
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,493
Check to see
if the rest of the street lost power.

416
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:24,758
Just us.

417
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,843
It's Meier.

418
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:28,543
Cover the exits.

419
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,579
Check the fuse box.

420
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:29,861
- CTU. O'Brian.
- <i>Chloe. It's Jack.</i>

421
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:31,901
Everyone's been looking for you.
Where are you?

422
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,726
I need you to trace this call
and send a Tac team immediately.

423
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,320
Trace the call.

424
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:23,733
We're sure NYPD's got
the perimeter locked down?

425
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:26,055
Everything in a block radius
is secure.

426
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:28,598
Our response team
will be there soon.

427
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:31,060
Where's Dana?

428
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,627
She logged out of the building
about 15 minutes ago.

429
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:37,024
Something about fixing a faulty relay
at our 17th Street station.

430
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,151
Why didn't she have
maintenance take care?

431
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,528
Good question.

432
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,155
She had to manually reboot
the firmware herself.

433
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:45,616
That's what she said anyway.

434
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:49,412
- Where are we with this man Bazhaev?
- It's coming through right now.

435
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,424
I've cross-accessed
interagency servers,

436
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,539
also Interpol and FSB.

437
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:57,253
I'm relaying intel as it comes in
to our response team and to Jack.

438
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,221
Good. Put it up on screen.

439
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,134
Okay, people.

440
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:05,428
We've ID'd the suspect
we have in custody.

441
00:30:06,257 --> 00:30:09,432
His name is
Sergei Petrovich Bazhaev,

442
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,892
Ukrainian national, 61 years of age.

443
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,438
Now, we believe he knows the location
of the unsecured nuclear rods.

444
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:19,316
Now, tactical is on its way
to transport him here for interrogation.

445
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,194
Agent Ortiz will coordinate operations
from here.

446
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,173
Is it true?
You found Jack?

447
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,669
He's okay.

448
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,884
If you're finished with your statement,
I need to take you to medical.

449
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:45,050
I want to be here
when Jack gets back.

450
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:47,516
I'll let him know where to find you.
Come on.

451
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,606
This should hold you for now.

452
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:53,435
But you have to go to the hospital.

453
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,020
Excuse me, sir.
They uploaded the suspect's file.

454
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,316
- How far out is CTU?
- They're about five minutes out.

455
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:05,747
It's all right.
I got it. Thanks.

456
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,547
Sergeant?

457
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:24,597
I need to speak with this man alone.

458
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,607
I knew you were a cop.

459
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:39,355
I should have trusted my instincts
and killed you on the spot.

460
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,857
You can add it
to your list of regrets.

461
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,070
CTU's already acquired
a great deal of intel on you...

462
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,219
Mr. Bazhaev.

463
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:53,786
It's over. You know that, right?
You're finished.

464
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,744
At the very least,
we've got you on kidnapping and murder,

465
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:02,435
before CTU rips this place apart
and uncovers your criminal activity.

466
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,733
Lucky for you, though,

467
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,008
I'm only interested in one thing,

468
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,386
the acquisition of those fuel rods.

469
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:11,856
So,

470
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,885
if you were to cooperate,

471
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:16,215
help me out there,

472
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:20,771
that would go a long way
to reducing a very long prison sentence.

473
00:32:23,482 --> 00:32:25,609
That offer extends
to both of your sons, too...

474
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,044
Josef...

475
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,417
and Oleg.

476
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,820
Oleg is dead.

477
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:35,581
He was exposed to the rods.

478
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,354
Became ill with radiation poisoning.

479
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,590
He was suffering,

480
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,086
and I shot him,

481
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,706
as if he was just a sick dog.

482
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:52,516
I murdered my own son.

483
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:56,095
For nothing.

484
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,322
You want to know where the rods are?

485
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:11,158
I will tell you.

486
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:12,656
But I want full immunity.

487
00:33:13,234 --> 00:33:15,982
Not just for me,
but for my other son, Josef.

488
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:17,620
I don't think I can make that.

489
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,106
Then we have nothing to talk about.

490
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:35,134
I'll see what I can do.

491
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:44,104
CTU. O'Brian.

492
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,336
It's Jack.
I need to speak with Hastings.

493
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:48,773
I think he's in a briefing
with President Taylor.

494
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:51,170
Even better.
See if you can patch me in, okay?

495
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,874
Mr. Hastings,
it's Farhad Hassan I'm worried about.

496
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,086
How do we know
he hasn't the rods already?

497
00:33:58,211 --> 00:34:00,961
Based on the intel we have,
the transfer hasn't taken place yet.

498
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,374
<i>Excuse the interruption.
Jack Bauer is on the line.</i>

499
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:06,746
- <i>He wishes to be conferenced in.</i>
- Put him through.

500
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:08,128
It's President Taylor.

501
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,048
<i>You're on with Mr. Hastings
and my chief of staff.</i>

502
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,332
CTU's been keeping me apprised
of your involvement in this.

503
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,211
I'm sorry that it's taken
this long for us to speak.

504
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:19,647
Please forgive me
for getting straight to the point,

505
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:23,587
but the man we have in custody,
Sergei Bazhaev, is willing to cooperate.

506
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:27,209
He said he would hand over the fuel rods
in exchange for full immunity.

507
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,774
Is that all?
Why don't he give him a parade, too?

508
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,252
You've been dealing with him.
Is there another way to get the location

509
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:35,039
of the nuclear materials out of him?

510
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:37,616
It says in his files that he did
12 years in a labor camp.

511
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:41,650
In the time frame that we have,
we're not gonna break him.

512
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:45,087
- I can see it in his eyes.
- Mr. Hastings, what is your assessment?

513
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:49,112
Well, at first blush, I'd say
an immunity deal is premature, but...

514
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:53,023
under the circumstances,
I'll defer to Jack's judgment on this.

515
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:55,649
Gentlemen, I have a peace deal
that's going to fall apart

516
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:58,474
at any moment
unless I can show President Hassan

517
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,452
we've stopped his brother from smuggling
those fuel rods out of the country.

518
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,394
Make the deal, Jack.

519
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,272
- He's going to want this in writing.
- <i>He'll get it.</i>

520
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,774
But in the interests of expediency,

521
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,772
<i>put him on the phone with me.</i>

522
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,533
The President wants to talk to you.

523
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,214
Tell me what's going on.

524
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:37,395
- What are you talking about?
- You're implying something about Dana,

525
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,677
I want to know.

526
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,569
When she came over before
and said she had to talk to you,

527
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,476
- what did she tell you?
- Nothing.

528
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,228
- She had a problem and she'd handle it.
- That's it?

529
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:50,522
Arlo, if you know something...

530
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:55,812
it's none of my business,
and I didn't want to tell you this,

531
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:58,238
but I think
she went to meet some guy.

532
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,202
You're out of your mind.

533
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,462
Take a look at this.

534
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,747
- Who is he?
- I checked with the gate.

535
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,587
They said his name is Kevin Wade.

536
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,715
Identified himself as a friend.

537
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,385
So he's a friend.

538
00:36:35,436 --> 00:36:37,653
Bazhaev's given up
the location of the nuclear rods.

539
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:41,198
I've already scrambled a NEST team.
Meet your tactical unit at the helipad.

540
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:44,236
The coordinates will be relayed
to you en route.

541
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:48,274
You think you can find her?

542
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:50,374
I could
if all the drones weren't committed.

543
00:36:50,763 --> 00:36:52,042
What about a cell trace?

544
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,970
Just do it.

545
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,990
I don't know where you are
or what you're doing, Dana,

546
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:31,121
but I need you to call me
as soon as you get this. It's important.

547
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:33,118
I love you.

548
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:43,635
Thank you, sir.
Sorry.

549
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,111
Don't worry about it.

550
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:04,931
Miss Kayla, no.

551
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,284
Get out of my way, Nabeel,
I want to see him.

552
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,101
Your father forbids it.

553
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,290
I'm doing my job.

554
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:15,125
A job that Tarin gave you.

555
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:17,744
He brought you
into my father's security detail,

556
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,421
and this is how you repay him?

557
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,367
You're his friend, Nabeel.

558
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:25,272
You know he's innocent.

559
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:29,679
- What would you have me do?
- Just let me speak to him.

560
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:31,372
A few minutes is all I ask.

561
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,082
I can't let you in now.

562
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:38,882
Tarin's going to be readied
for transport to our embassy in an hour.

563
00:38:39,189 --> 00:38:41,318
I will find a moment
you can see him before then.

564
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,832
Thank you, Nabeel.

565
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:47,115
Now go before we're both in trouble.

566
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,253
The NEST team's ETA
is two minutes from target site.

567
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,695
Now the HAZMAT crew will wait
for your signal to move in.

568
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:05,122
Be advised,

569
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:06,925
<i>the truck with the fuel rods</i>

570
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,500
<i>is being guarded
by two armed hostiles.</i>

571
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:11,680
We've a deal with their boss.

572
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:13,475
Why haven't they standed down?

573
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:17,366
Jack's understanding is that
these men are hard cases.

574
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:20,030
They won't roll over easily.
We cannot take the risk...

575
00:39:20,155 --> 00:39:21,566
they'll flee with the rods.

576
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,613
- Understood.
- <i>When you secure the nuclear materials,</i>

577
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,822
you'll transport them
to Fort Hamilton.

578
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,791
<i>We're clearing that air corridor
as we speak.</i>

579
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:36,667
Command, we see the truck,
but there's no sign of hostiles.

580
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,304
Approaching the weigh station now.
Stand by.

581
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:40,836
Set us down there.

582
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:09,993
Picking up trace radiation.

583
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,491
30 millirads. It's safe.

584
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,351
We're clear.

585
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,527
Command, are you seeing this?

586
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,930
I am.

587
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,156
Where the hell are the rods?

588
00:40:51,643 --> 00:40:53,493
We picked up
trace radiation signatures.

589
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,068
The rods were here.

590
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,704
Right now all we have are two bodies,
both shot.

591
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,483
You can have a good time.

592
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:31,738
It's okay to laugh once in a while.
You can be a happy person.

593
00:41:39,678 --> 00:41:41,429
- This is Bauer.
- It's Hastings.

594
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:44,084
Our team's at the truck stop.
The nuclear rods are not there.

595
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:45,306
What?

596
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:47,281
Hold on. Say that again.

597
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:50,117
<i>I said the rods are not there.</i>

598
00:41:51,017 --> 00:41:53,260
It's not possible.
Did your men go to the right place?

599
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,805
They went exactly where you sent them.
Now stop and tell us where the rods are.

600
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,074
I told you, they were there.

601
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:02,743
- I had two of my men guarding them.
- <i>We found their bodies, both shot.</i>

602
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:03,937
<i>Something else.</i>

603
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:07,011
Some kind of necklace hanging
on the inside of the truck's door.

604
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:08,775
Like someone wanted
to send a message.

605
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:10,652
- What kind?
- <i>A gold cross.</i>

606
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,265
What does that mean?

607
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:19,367
Josef.

608
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:25,500
I have the fuel rods.

609
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:27,115
Really?

610
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:31,006
I wasn't sure I believed
that you would betray your father.

611
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,616
You were upset
that he was holding up delivery,

612
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:35,491
now I've gotten them for you.

613
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:39,055
It won't take him long to realize,
so let's get this done fast.

614
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,433
You're worried he'll discover
you've replaced him.

615
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:44,478
I want my father to know.

616
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:48,190
- In fact, I made sure he will.
- When will you get here?

617
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:50,197
Less than five minutes.

618
00:42:50,498 --> 00:42:51,985
Just have my money ready.
