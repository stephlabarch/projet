1
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,378
Have you made the preparations?

2
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,596
<i>Are you sure you want
to leave now, Colonel?</i>

3
00:00:15,764 --> 00:00:17,715
Can't imagine General
Juma will be pleased

4
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:19,384
to learn that you're
abandoning your mission.

5
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:20,585
The mission is over.

6
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:22,387
You think I'm a fool,
Mr. Burnett?

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,005
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country,

8
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:27,158
the data file with all the
names and bank transactions

9
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:29,962
of all those involved will be
sent to the Justice Department.

10
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:32,690
When the car arrives,
we would like you to go with the driver

11
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:34,595
so that we could follow
you back to Dubaku.

12
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,437
You want her to go
to him and face him?

13
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,733
It's the only chance we
have of finding him before

14
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,273
he disappears forever.
I'll do it.

15
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:41,903
You keep her safe, you hear me?

16
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:43,201
We will.

17
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:46,370
Colonel!

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,342
FBI.

19
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:48,783
Go! Go!

20
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,950
I want the names of everyone in
the United States government

21
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:02,061
that you've been working with.

22
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,362
I have a list.

23
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:06,493
I found some kind of digital storage
device implanted under Dubaku's skin.

24
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:07,933
Can you upload
the files to FBI?

25
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:10,660
Marika didn't make it.

26
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:13,132
You killed my sister.
I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,871
What do you want from me?! I just
want to know that you feel something.

28
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,372
I want to know that you feel
the same kind of pain that I do!

29
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:21,640
Do you feel that?!

30
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,831
I'm working with FBI to
coordinate an interagency sweep.

31
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:27,582
We should start making
arrests within the hour.

32
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:30,150
What you have done here today
puts all of us in your debt.

33
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,851
There are a lot of people to thank,
including Jack Bauer.

34
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,060
What are you asking
me to do, Bill?

35
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,162
<i>I'm asking you to speak
to Senator Mayer.</i>

36
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:38,933
Jack Bauer helped
save this country.

37
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,002
He doesn't deserve to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

38
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,730
I'm going to the
White House. Sir?

39
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:46,530
President Taylor wants to speak
to me regarding Jack Bauer.

40
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:48,040
Grab your laptop, Ryan.

41
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:49,801
I want you there with me.

42
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:51,312
There's gonna be
another attack.

43
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,270
Here in D.C.

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,583
My source tells me that the
window opens at 1900 hours.

45
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:57,141
What's the target?

46
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>He doesn't know
the exact target,</i>

47
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:02,383
but it's definitely going to be
of high value and high impact.

48
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,722
He gave me the name of somebody who's
been involved in the planning. Who?

49
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:06,522
Ryan Burnett.

50
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:08,193
Senator Mayer's chief of staff.

51
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,091
<i>That's right.</i>

52
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:32,452
Hold on a second.

53
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,223
Go ahead.

54
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,383
Dr. Schonfeld, 305.

55
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:40,293
Dr. Schonfeld, 305.

56
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,292
ICU.

57
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:44,992
One moment, please.

58
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,561
Corinna, you got
a call on three.

59
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:47,762
Who is it?

60
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:49,502
Dr. May. He's got a question.

61
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,471
Doctors are so helpless.

62
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,472
Dr. May?

63
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,913
Hello?

64
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:02,842
There was no one there.

65
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,611
If he calls back,
tell him I'll call him back in a minute.

66
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:11,351
Code Blue.

67
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,993
Code Blue!
We have a Code Blue in the ICU!

68
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,362
Get Agent Walker
down to ICU now!

69
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,543
<i>Swift and decisive is how
the Pentagon describes</i>

70
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:23,503
<i>the U.S.
invasion now underway in Sangala.</i>

71
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:26,800
<i>"Sporadic resistance,
minimal casualties."</i>

72
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,103
<i>This in direct contrast
to assertions made</i>

73
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,111
<i>by Sangalese leader
Benjamin Juma</i>

74
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,273
<i>on state-supported
television.</i>

75
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:38,953
Our brave soldiers are beating back
the enemy all across Sangala City.

76
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,620
History is on our side,
my friends.

77
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:46,993
We survived their slave ships,
and we will survive their warships, too.

78
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:51,292
Declaring victory while his own
troops are fleeing the capital,

79
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,093
and his palace lies in ruins.

80
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,132
When do we think this was made?

81
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:59,071
My guess is these recordings were made
some time before the invasion, ma'am.

82
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,500
Which begs the question, John.

83
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,670
Where is he,
and why haven't we found him yet?

84
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:06,470
Special Forces teams all over
Sangala City are searching for him.

85
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:10,340
There is some intelligence to
suggest he may have fled the country.

86
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:15,121
Admiral Smith, you and I both
know that Juma must be captured.

87
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,151
He must be tried and convicted
of his crimes against humanity.

88
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,890
Otherwise, we've
as good as failed.

89
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,392
He can't go far, ma'am.

90
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:23,362
No country on earth
will grant him asylum.

91
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,693
Then find him, Admiral Smith.

92
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:28,463
Wherever he is.

93
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:34,003
General Juma?

94
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:37,502
Beautiful, isn't it?

95
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:38,943
Sir?

96
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,212
It's not a trick
question, Laurent.

97
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:43,112
<i>It is beautiful.</i>

98
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:45,282
Why not?

99
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,580
It is almost time.

100
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:51,153
The men-- are they ready?

101
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,793
Yes, sir.

102
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,421
Are they afraid?

103
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:58,121
I don't know, sir,
but some of them are praying.

104
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,432
It's good if they are afraid.

105
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,932
It means they will
fight bravely.

106
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:08,273
Have you heard from
my father yet, sir?

107
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:11,142
I thought he was supposed
to be meeting us here.

108
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:13,141
Don't worry, Laurent.

109
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:15,182
He will be here.

110
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:17,310
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,193
Yes.

112
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,391
Colonel Dubaku is dead.

113
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:27,620
Are you certain?

114
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,493
The dose I administered
was catastrophic.

115
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,691
His son just asked
me about him.

116
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:36,103
He must never know about this,
or about his father's cowardice.

117
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,363
He won't.

118
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,131
Then nothing will stand in our way, Udo.
But hurry.

119
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,572
The attack window is narrowing.

120
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:43,943
The timing must be precise.

121
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,710
Clear! Yes, sir.

122
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,412
Clear.

123
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:54,153
One more time at 360.

124
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,421
Clear.

125
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:58,851
Nothing.

126
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,221
Going again, Doctor?

127
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:05,832
No.

128
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,091
That's it, everybody.
I'm calling it.

129
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,532
Time of death: 6:06 p.m.

130
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,831
Dr. Stahl, what's going on?

131
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,172
A massive heart attack.

132
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,672
You said that he was stable,
that he was going to be okay.

133
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:15,743
So, what happened?

134
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:16,941
I'm not sure.

135
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:18,742
Maybe a preexisting condition.

136
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,353
The autopsy will tell us.
Excuse me.

137
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:27,080
The wide extent of the corruption
requires a coordinated approach.

138
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:29,253
We know the government's
been compromised.

139
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,983
We just don't know
at what level.

140
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,003
Presently, Chloe O'Brian is vetting
the names department by department.

141
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,392
I'm prioritizing
Secret Service,

142
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,290
so the president is secured
as soon as possible.

143
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,700
Team leaders will then receive their
assignments-- Defense, Treasury, State,

144
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:46,405
et cetera-- and make their arrests
contemporaneously across the District.

145
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:51,077
O'Brian.

146
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:52,273
Chloe, it's Jack.

147
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,612
Have the names from Dubaku's database
been handed over to the arrest
teams yet?

148
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,842
Not yet. Okay, listen to me.

149
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:59,453
I've just learned that Juma's
operatives are planning another attack.

150
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:01,221
Jack, they're telling
us here it's over.

151
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,580
That's wrong.
Tony's my source on the intel.

152
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:04,931
Do you know what the target is?

153
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:07,090
Only that it's high value,
high casualty, and that

154
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,020
it's happening now,
which is why I need your help.

155
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,160
There's a man on the list,
a Ryan Burnett.

156
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:13,163
He's Senator Mayer's
chief of staff.

157
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,700
Mayer? Isn't he the guy who
grilled you this morning

158
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,270
at the Senate
Subcommittee hearing?

159
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:19,432
Yeah, but the senator's not
implicated in the conspiracy.

160
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:22,303
But Burnett has been providing
support for Juma and Dubaku all along.

161
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:24,502
Chloe, I need you to delete
his name from the list.

162
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,013
What? Why?

163
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,743
If the FBI start to move in on him,
he'll lawyer up,

164
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,311
and no one will get the
information on time.

165
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,613
Where is he now?

166
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,431
He's at the White
House with the senator.

167
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:35,111
They've got a meeting
with the president.

168
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,650
I'm on my way there now
to be debriefed by Bill.

169
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:37,843
I'll take care of him then.

170
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,891
Jack, you don't expect to interrogate
a suspect in the White House?

171
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:41,763
Let me handle that.

172
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,663
Chloe, just get his name
deleted from the list.

173
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,731
I'll get back to you.

174
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,891
She's in.

175
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:24,732
Hi.

176
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,743
How close are we? Close.

177
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,310
Is there anything
I can do to help?

178
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,441
I'm just cycling through
the last layer of data now.

179
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,672
You know, it might be quicker if you
send the subsets to my station one
by one.

180
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:37,212
Good idea.

181
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:40,711
And then that way I can get
to work on distributing them.

182
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,253
Okay, then.

183
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,393
Thank you.

184
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:02,403
Listen, Jack,
maybe you should reconsider.

185
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,270
Reconsider what?

186
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:07,511
Taking Bill into
your confidence.

187
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:10,883
Look, I mean, he's been a part of
this operation since the get-go.

188
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:14,283
I don't know what it's going to
take to get Burnett to talk.

189
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,653
If I have to use
extreme measures...

190
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:19,193
I don't get it.
What, you don't think he'll go there?

191
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:22,423
I'm driving off a
cliff here, Tony.

192
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,121
I don't need to put Bill
in the passenger seat.

193
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,363
All right, then, fine.

194
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:28,860
I'll go with you.

195
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:30,832
You're a wanted felon.

196
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,332
You wouldn't get past
the first checkpoint.

197
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,270
Besides, with all of
the government agencies

198
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,411
still compromised, it might be
up to you to stop the attack.

199
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:43,213
See you on the other side.

200
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:53,223
Yes?

201
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,191
Can you extend
the attack window?

202
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:57,221
Not without risking
the entire operation.

203
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,430
Why?

204
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,361
There's been a complication.

205
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:03,131
I may be stuck here longer
than I anticipated.

206
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:05,131
I'll call you back.

207
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:05,972
Mr. Kanin.

208
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,201
Ryan Burnett,
Senator Mayer's chief of staff.

209
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,402
We've spoken on the phone.

210
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:10,471
Many times.

211
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:11,851
It's good to finally meet you.

212
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:13,440
Likewise. The senator's inside.

213
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,241
Right this way.

214
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,750
Senator?

215
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,851
Well, Senator,
I see you've found the bar.

216
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:28,021
Mind if I join you?

217
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,563
Something I never knew.

218
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:34,863
If it ain't from Kentucky,
you can't call it bourbon.

219
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:37,330
Spare me the Southern
gentleman routine, Ethan.

220
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,173
The president didn't
call me up here

221
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:43,641
at the ass-end of the day to drink her
booze and flip through a briefing book.

222
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:47,110
I thought it might be helpful, before
your meeting, to bring you up to speed

223
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:48,611
on the events of
the last ten hours.

224
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,512
Okay.

225
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:52,913
I'm up to speed.

226
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:59,392
Senator, surely you have some
reaction to what you just read.

227
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:01,963
Damn right I have a reaction.

228
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,623
I want to know what all this
has to do with Jack Bauer.

229
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,962
I mean,
that's the reason I'm here, right?

230
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:09,560
Without Mr.
Bauer, we would never have uncovered

231
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:13,002
the conspiracy in the first
place nor the people behind it.

232
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:16,301
His efforts, in conjunction with those
of the FBI, are largely responsible

233
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,172
for the arrests being made
right now across the District.

234
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:23,542
You're not saying that he's
acting in an official capacity?

235
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,611
I don't have to tell you
how this looks, Ethan.

236
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,983
Colluding with a rogue operative
from a disbanded agency.

237
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,722
I'm sorry you see it that way.

238
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,723
How else am I
supposed to see it?

239
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:35,392
The way the president does--

240
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:41,460
that Jack Bauer saved lives today, plain
and simple, including her husband's.

241
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:44,873
Look, Senator,
I know this isn't easy for you.

242
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,631
The public battle you've waged

243
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:49,443
against detainee abuse and
human rights violations...

244
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:54,313
Are you seriously asking me to
look the other way on this?

245
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:57,180
I have been after this
son of a bitch for years.

246
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:58,912
He's a thug, Ethan.

247
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,413
He's exhibit "A."

248
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:08,221
The president is prepared
to reverse policy

249
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:11,120
and support your amendment
to the War Crimes Act.

250
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,162
In exchange for what exactly?

251
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:15,431
The hearings.

252
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:17,860
Declare a recess till
after the holidays

253
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:21,672
and then quietly let Mr.
Bauer's subpoena expire.

254
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:23,342
And if I refuse to go along?

255
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:26,710
The president is prepared to invoke
executive privilege.
Executive privilege--

256
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,270
meaning what exactly?

257
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:31,581
Well, that's for the
president to decide.

258
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:34,812
Are you talking about a pardon?

259
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,022
I wouldn't rule it out.

260
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:39,250
Well, if that's how the
president wants to play it,

261
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:43,492
you can tell her she just
walked into a street fight.

262
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:46,562
You can tell her yourself.

263
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,971
Jack.

264
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,982
Hi, Bill.
You got here sooner than I expected.

265
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:07,253
Jack. Put down your weapon now!

266
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,123
Step away from the desk!

267
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,950
Take a seat.

268
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,121
Sit down, Bill!

269
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:17,060
Okay, okay, I'm sitting.

270
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:18,762
Now, what's this all about?

271
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:20,230
Where is Ryan Burnett? What?

272
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:22,203
Senator Mayer's chief of staff--
where is he?

273
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:24,631
I'm not saying anything until you
tell me what the hell's going on.

274
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,072
Tony doubled back to
one of his contacts,

275
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,072
who gave him information
of a second attack.

276
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:31,640
It's going to take place here
in Washington within the hour.

277
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:33,341
Juma's operatives
are carrying it out.

278
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,112
Burnett's been supporting
them all along.

279
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:37,112
He knows where the attack's
going to take place, so you can

280
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,512
either tell me where he is
or I will find him myself.

281
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,952
Jack, I can't.

282
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:46,221
Fine, put your hands
behind your back now.

283
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:48,762
How good is the intel?

284
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:51,591
Good enough for me to
need to talk to him.

285
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:53,062
Don't you move.

286
00:13:54,337 --> 00:13:56,032
Jack, let me have him arrested.

287
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,200
There are other ways
to deal with this.

288
00:13:58,306 --> 00:13:59,200
The attack window's open.

289
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:01,672
We're out of time.

290
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:04,443
Jack, listen to me.

291
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:07,541
I spoke to the president
on your behalf.

292
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:12,213
She's going to intervene with
Senator Mayer, stop the hearings.

293
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,512
You can get your life back.

294
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,423
You do this,
you're throwing it all away.

295
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,282
I wish I thought there
was another option.

296
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,453
Let me help you at least, Jack.

297
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,960
Y-You don't have
to do this alone.

298
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,330
Yes, I do.

299
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,902
It's the only way I can make
sure to keep you out of this.

300
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,732
Jack. Bill, I'm sorry.

301
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,090
Jack, w-w-wait!

302
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,303
Jack!

303
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:39,113
It's all right.

304
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:41,441
Don't fight it.

305
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:14,933
This is Moss.

306
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,090
Larry, it's me.

307
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,463
Dubaku's dead.

308
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:19,963
I thought the doctors
said he was stabilized.

309
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:20,970
What happened?

310
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:23,633
Officially, they're characterizing
that it was a coronary

311
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,270
brought on by systemic shock.

312
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:26,773
Sounds like you
don't believe it.

313
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:28,873
I did a follow-up with
the hospital admin.

314
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:31,743
She confirmed that there was an
eight-member team on duty when
Dubaku flatlined.

315
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,141
Yeah?

316
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:35,783
There was a ninth man in the ICU just
before the code was called-- an orderly.

317
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,352
I ran back the tapes on the ward
and that's when I spotted him.

318
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:41,141
The thing is: I've asked around
and nobody seems to know who he is.

319
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,021
Renee, wait, a-are you saying
you think Dubaku was murdered?

320
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:46,963
I'm saying that there was an
unidentified man in with Dubaku

321
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,791
just before he went
into cardiac arrest.

322
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,002
What does the admin say?

323
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,431
She says that they often use floaters--
personnel from other area hospitals

324
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,032
filling in from time to time.

325
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,013
Said it's not uncommon for the regular
staff not to know who they are.

326
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:00,571
She's double-checking
with payroll now.

327
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,240
Right, so there's your answer.

328
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:03,841
Still it seems odd.

329
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:08,310
I mean, what if Dubaku knew something
and they needed to shut him up?

330
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:09,783
Is this Bauer's theory, too?

331
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:12,952
Jack's not even here and, you know,
I resent that implication, Larry.

332
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,450
That I'm not the one calling the shots.
What implication is that?

333
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,280
This has been my investigation from
the beginning, not Jack Bauer's.

334
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,562
I was just asking a question.

335
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,932
I wasn't implying anything.

336
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:27,001
You there? I'm sorry.

337
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:29,501
I guess I'm a little
sensitive on the subject.

338
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:33,040
Look, everything we needed from Dubaku,
we got.

339
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:36,071
Names and bank accounts of every
corrupt official on his payroll.

340
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:37,650
Teams are in the
field as we speak.

341
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:39,440
So you're saying you
want me to come in.

342
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:40,983
We need you back in the
office sooner than later

343
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:43,050
to help process
all these arrests.

344
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:47,023
Larry, look, I've got security searching
the hospital and reviewing more video.

345
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:48,993
So, what,
you want to follow that up first?

346
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,652
Fine, call me when
you clear it. Yeah.

347
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:51,561
I will.

348
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:52,661
Thanks, Larry.

349
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:53,793
Excuse me, Agent Walker?

350
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:56,563
That orderly you were looking for--
one of our parking lot cameras

351
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,731
picked him up getting
into his car. When?

352
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:02,102
Uh, about 15 minutes ago. I've got
a screen grab of his license plate.

353
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:06,972
Thank you.

354
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:09,913
This is Agent Walker.

355
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:12,081
Put me through to
our DMV contact.

356
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:18,781
Are you busy?

357
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:22,322
I'm just reformatting the server,
so, yeah, I guess I am busy. Why?

358
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:25,593
Well, I was cross-referencing
Dubaku's offshore accounts

359
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:27,612
and I came across an
orphaned header fragment.

360
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:28,993
What are you talking about?

361
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:30,061
Take a look.

362
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:37,603
Okay, see, there,
right there, right there.

363
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,271
It's a remnant file header.

364
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:41,770
It's probably just a
phantom data string.

365
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:42,643
No, it isn't.

366
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,112
I ran a systems analysis.

367
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,811
The coding is not random.

368
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:48,051
It can be traced back
to one of the accounts.

369
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:50,651
Also, it looks like a name
was deleted from the list.

370
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:52,980
Why don't I run a
recovery program?

371
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,522
Well, you're very busy with
the reformatting and all,

372
00:17:55,695 --> 00:17:59,121
so why don't I just upload it to my
station and take care of it there?

373
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:02,190
Well, that's okay,
I can do it faster.

374
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,763
No offense.

375
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:06,630
I'll let you know if
I retrieve anything.

376
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,130
Sure.

377
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,072
Thanks.

378
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:14,642
Thank you.

379
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:25,120
Yeah.

380
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:26,991
Have you gotten to Burnett yet?

381
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,051
Working on it.

382
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:29,671
Making my way over
to the West Wing.

383
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,362
Someone here has figured out that a name
has been deleted from the database.

384
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:34,021
I don't know how much
longer I can hold her off.

385
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:35,163
Do they know it was Burnett?

386
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:36,892
No, but it's just
a matter of time.

387
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:39,262
Okay, I'll get back to you.

388
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:42,331
Great.

389
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,712
Senator, I'll head back to
the Hill and get with Sandy.

390
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,641
We should have a press release drafted
by the time you finish your meeting.

391
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:50,713
<i>I'm also going to need a sit-down
with your friend Hauser at the Post.</i>

392
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,612
Off the record, I assume.

393
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:55,883
We've got to make pardoning
Jack Bauer as politically toxic

394
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:58,180
for the president as possible.

395
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,752
She's a woman in a
highly emotional state.

396
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:01,890
Her husband's been shot.

397
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,290
You suggesting her
judgment's impaired?

398
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,961
I'm suggesting that
a case could be made.

399
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,161
Excuse me, Senator.

400
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,390
President Taylor is
ready to see you now.

401
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:10,293
Go ahead, Senator.

402
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:13,061
I'll get this to the AG,
tell him you want the option to go ahead

403
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:14,132
with the hearings
tomorrow as scheduled.

404
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,203
Thanks, Ryan.

405
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:24,971
Yes?

406
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:25,843
It's Burnett.

407
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,312
You took care of the problem?

408
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:28,410
I'm leaving now.

409
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,553
Good, then we rendezvous at 2130 hours,
as planned.

410
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:33,580
I'll be there.

411
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:49,733
Excuse me,
I'll be out of here in just one second.

412
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:52,501
You and I...

413
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,782
...we're going to have a talk.

414
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,183
We've got a command
post set up at EEOB,

415
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,320
and we'll brief CIA and
Diplomatic Security,

416
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:17,051
but not until after the
first sweep of arrests.

417
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,321
Look, nobody is
going anywhere, Phil.

418
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:20,782
We've dropped a
net on the city.

419
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,563
And I'll let you know as
soon as that happens.

420
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:23,731
All right.

421
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:26,801
Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need you to listen to something.

422
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,831
May I? Yeah, that's fine.

423
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:31,092
She's supposed to be this
whiz-bang systems analyst,

424
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,970
which is actually what tipped
me off in the first place.

425
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,373
Her demeanor is so bizarre...
W-W-Whoa, Janis, Janis, slow down.

426
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:36,400
Who are you talking about?

427
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:37,511
Chloe O'Brian.

428
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:39,730
I ran a systems check on her work,
and it turns out

429
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,183
there's evidence
of file tampering.

430
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:43,813
Plus she's been scrambling all
her out-of-office phone calls,

431
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:46,651
so I had Operations archive
her cellular traffic.

432
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,483
I did a work-around.

433
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:49,493
Listen.

434
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:50,351
Yeah.

435
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,960
Have you gotten to Burnett yet?

436
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:52,763
Working on it.

437
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,322
Making my way over
to the West Wing.

438
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,862
Someone here has figured out that a name
has been deleted from the database.

439
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,930
I don't know how much
longer I can hold her off.

440
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:00,333
Do they know it was Burnett?

441
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:02,273
No, but it's just
a matter of time.

442
00:21:02,436 --> 00:21:03,973
Okay, I'll get back to you.

443
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,141
Becker.

444
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:11,072
In the conference room.

445
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,642
I want Chloe O'Brian detained.

446
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,913
And get her off that server.

447
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:34,101
Get me the White House.

448
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,373
Let me just remind you, Madam President,
you supported the effort

449
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:44,141
to ban abuse and torture.

450
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:47,542
You campaigned to reform
the intelligence agencies.

451
00:21:47,717 --> 00:21:49,552
These past ten hours, Senator,

452
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:52,823
things haven't appeared as black
and white as they once did.

453
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:55,283
Well, there's nothing
gray about Jack Bauer.

454
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,523
The man has
committed atrocities.

455
00:21:57,697 --> 00:22:00,323
Prisoners have died
in his custody.

456
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:04,132
Mr. Bauer has served under the aegis
of three presidents, not just me.

457
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,961
Is it any more lawful
or any less repugnant

458
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:09,303
if it's authorized at
the highest level?

459
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:12,300
A state of war is not a blank check
for the president or for anyone.

460
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:14,173
Oh, don't lecture me, Senator.

461
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:17,142
I am well aware of the
limits of my power.

462
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:19,642
Due respect, Madam President...

463
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,143
your power is great.

464
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:24,852
Just be careful that you use
it to send the right message.

465
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:29,753
All I'm asking you to do is excuse Mr.
Bauer as a witness.

466
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:31,291
It's not a message.

467
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:34,792
It is an expression of gratitude
for what he's done today.

468
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:40,361
You're asking me to excuse him as
a target of the investigation.

469
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:42,703
And the message is clear.

470
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:46,172
Under certain circumstances,
you believe his methods are acceptable.

471
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:49,673
Some would argue that they are.

472
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:51,371
And they would be wrong.

473
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:54,840
Under any military
or moral standard.

474
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:58,082
America has been down this road before,
Madam President.

475
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,680
You yourself called it
a national tragedy.

476
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,590
<i>It was a tragedy.</i>

477
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,450
I still believe that.

478
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:08,663
Pardon Jack Bauer, and you're telling
every interrogator in the field

479
00:23:08,838 --> 00:23:10,630
that it's open season again.

480
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,302
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Madam President.

481
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,373
There's an urgent call
from Larry Moss at FBI.

482
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:23,512
Put him through.

483
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:25,113
Agent Moss is on the line.

484
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,312
Agent Moss,
this is Ethan Kanin.

485
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,973
You're on speaker
with the president.

486
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:31,153
Madam President, forgive me for
coming directly to the point.

487
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:34,120
You have a meeting this evening
with Senator Mayer? In fact, I do.

488
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:35,253
I'm with him right now.

489
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:38,050
Did the senator's chief of staff,
Ryan Burnett, accompany

490
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:39,822
the senator to the White House?

491
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:41,620
Yes, he did, Agent Moss-- why?

492
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,491
I have reason to
believe that Jack Bauer

493
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:48,563
is carrying out an off-book
interrogation of Mr. Burnett as
we speak.

494
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:57,273
I can pull the trigger 128 more
times before this battery dies.

495
00:23:57,445 --> 00:24:00,841
I'm telling you,
I don't know anything about an attack.

496
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:01,702
Stop lying to me.

497
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,312
I'm not lying.
What's the target?

498
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,952
I can't tell you what I don't know.
Mr. Burnett,

499
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:07,723
you are a traitor
and a terrorist.

500
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:08,751
I'm not.

501
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,392
I love my country.

502
00:24:12,296 --> 00:24:15,090
That was 1,200
volts of current.

503
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:19,931
Now, when I eject this cartridge,
I access the drive stun mode,

504
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:23,071
upping the voltage 40 times

505
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:24,771
when directly administered.

506
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,900
All you need to
do is talk to me.

507
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:28,403
Mr. Burnett,
it's really simple.

508
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:31,642
Just tell me what the target is,
and this will be all over. I promise.

509
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,783
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

510
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:38,150
This is your last chance.
If I knew, I would tell you, I swear it.

511
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:39,620
What do you want me to say?

512
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:42,322
Just... Just tell me what to say,
and I'll say it.

513
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,871
Don't you even try and
play that game with me.

514
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:51,163
Mr. Burnett, I've been doing this a long
time, and I can tell the difference,

515
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:53,960
especially when a man is under duress,
if he's got information that I need

516
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,331
or if I'm just wasting my time.

517
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:58,500
And I promise you,
I am not wasting my time.

518
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:02,971
The next jolt is gonna
be in your throat.

519
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:07,913
Anything above your neck runs the risk
of a complete neuromuscular shutdown.

520
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:10,980
That means you run the risk
of becoming paralyzed.

521
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:12,480
No, please.

522
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:16,153
Mr. Burnett, you built the
entire federal case against me.

523
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:19,163
You of all people should know
how far I am willing to go

524
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:20,822
to stop this attack
from happening.

525
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:23,361
So, I'm gonna ask
you one last time.

526
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:24,830
Where is the target?!

527
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,301
I...

528
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:29,771
Okay, okay, okay.

529
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:31,002
I'm listening.

530
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:32,573
Soldiers.

531
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:33,872
How many?

532
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:35,000
A unit.

533
00:25:35,178 --> 00:25:36,472
Juma's presidential guard.

534
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:37,471
When?

535
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:39,312
It already started.

536
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:40,313
Where?

537
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:41,411
Where?!

538
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:44,880
Mr. Bauer,
this is President Taylor.

539
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:46,220
Where is the target?

540
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:47,482
Mr. Bauer... Where?!

541
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:51,053
Mr. Bauer,
I am ordering you to answer this page.

542
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:53,491
Mr. Bauer, do you hear me?

543
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,031
Damn it!

544
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:58,130
Madam President,
this is Jack Bauer.

545
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,953
I don't know what you've heard so far,
but this thing is not over.

546
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:03,872
There is another terrorist attack
going to take place within minutes.

547
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:06,181
There will be no discussion
until you unlock this door.

548
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,270
Madam President,
the attack window is open.

549
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:09,512
Juma's men are moving.

550
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:12,183
What you're doing is against the law,
Mr. Bauer.

551
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:16,151
I am your commander in chief,
and I am ordering you to stand down.

552
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:22,622
How much longer, Sergeant?

553
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:24,420
Good to go, ma'am. Do it.

554
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:25,521
Where's the target?

555
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,363
Where is the target?!

556
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,830
Where is...?!

557
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:34,732
I had him!

558
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:40,041
Man down.

559
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:42,570
EMTs to the visiting
dignitary suite.

560
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:47,811
You're done, Bauer.

561
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,051
You're finished.

562
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:51,512
He was talking.

563
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:55,083
Whatever's going to happen is happening
now, and it's on your conscience.

564
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:57,952
My conscience has a lot less
to answer for than yours.

565
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:08,460
Mr. Bauer,
you say an attack is imminent.

566
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:09,902
My source intel is good.

567
00:27:10,077 --> 00:27:11,203
Who is your source?

568
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,143
I'd rather not say.

569
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:15,641
The name, Mr. Bauer.

570
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:21,311
Tony Almeida.

571
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,481
Tony Almeida--
the man's a fugitive.

572
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:26,420
Without Tony Almeida, we would
never have recovered the CIP device.

573
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:29,020
Madam President,
I don't care if his source

574
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:30,593
is the blessed Virgin Mary.

575
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:32,522
Nothing justifies what
went on in this room.

576
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,321
Even if he's right, Blaine?

577
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:37,490
Even if it means we
could save lives?

578
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:41,162
Look at that,
and tell me it's not barbarism.

579
00:27:41,337 --> 00:27:42,931
Is that something
you can live with?

580
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:47,243
Earlier today, Madam President,
two airplanes were brought down.

581
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:49,271
Is that something
you can live with?

582
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:52,682
You're reprehensible, Bauer.
And you, sir, are weak!

583
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:57,181
Unwilling and unable to look evil
in the eye and deal with it.

584
00:27:57,357 --> 00:27:59,651
Ethan, step out for a second.

585
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,833
Suddenly, it's not so hypothetical,
is it?

586
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:13,363
In your opinion,
is Bauer's intelligence actionable?

587
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:15,333
If Bauer says there's
going to be an attack,

588
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:17,770
my belief is,
there's going to be an attack.

589
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:25,412
<i>Torture was originally intended
to force false confessions.</i>

590
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:29,012
Now we use it to try
and find the truth.

591
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:31,382
These people murdered your son,
Madam President.

592
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:33,851
They attempted to
murder your husband.

593
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:36,120
They will stop at nothing.

594
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:51,270
Sergeant, take Mr. Bauer away.

595
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:52,542
He's under arrest.

596
00:28:57,845 --> 00:28:59,010
You should have come to me.

597
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,780
You should have
presented your case.

598
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:02,380
We didn't have time.

599
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:06,053
And would it really have
made a difference, ma'am?

600
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:16,433
Madam President...

601
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:17,762
you're doing the right thing.

602
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,430
271 dead already.

603
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:22,430
I wish to God it felt more
like the right thing.

604
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:23,932
Ethan, raise the threat levels.

605
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:28,142
Tell Homeland they have until 7:00
to come up with a response scenario.

606
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:29,512
And get Tim down here.

607
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:32,182
Also, I want to talk to Mr.
Burnett myself.

608
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:35,881
Let me do that.

609
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,153
I know the man.

610
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:39,982
Apparently, you don't.

611
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,423
Got it.

612
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:02,560
Tim, I understand the threat
level has been raised, but only

613
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,761
for first responders
and federal agents.

614
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:07,472
There's a concern that mass evacuation
by the public could hamper efforts

615
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:08,903
to thwart an attack
when it comes.

616
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:10,603
What about the airspace
over Washington?

617
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:11,601
Restricted.

618
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,342
Military flyovers
are commencing.

619
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:16,282
DOD has recommended that we deploy
mobile teams to sweep the area

620
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,382
for radioactive and
biological signatures.

621
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:21,110
I'll call Phillip at the
Pentagon and push it through.

622
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,310
What about NSA?

623
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,721
There's elevated
anti-American chatter

624
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,192
coming from the usual Web
sites and telephone traffic,

625
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,793
but nothing specific
to the attack.

626
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:29,793
Thank you, Tim.

627
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:32,492
I'll see you upstairs in 15 minutes.
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,632
Which means our best source of
intelligence is still right here under
our noses.

629
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:39,372
You realize we're gonna have to
offer this bastard a free pass.

630
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:42,940
With coercive measures off the table,
it's our only option.

631
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:46,513
Bauer's going to prison,
and a traitor walks.

632
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,012
What's wrong with this picture?

633
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:53,450
I need a minute
with the prisoner.

634
00:30:55,455 --> 00:31:00,723
Mr. Burnett, you will be charged
with treason under Title 18,

635
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:03,292
Section 2381,
of the United States Code.

636
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:05,293
Giving aid and
comfort to the enemy

637
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:08,290
and directly causing the
death of American citizens.

638
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,031
Do you understand?

639
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,400
Surely, you have something
to say for yourself.

640
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:17,701
I demand my right to counsel.

641
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:21,312
You'll have your counsel,
Mr. Burnett,

642
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:24,510
but first, you're going to
tell me everything you know.

643
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:26,613
Not in this lifetime.

644
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:30,152
What did you say?
I said, not in this lifetime.

645
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:34,051
Don't be so quick to make up your mind,
Mr. Burnett.

646
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:42,961
In exchange for information which stops
or significantly mitigates this attack,

647
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:47,332
the president is prepared to grant
you full immunity from prosecution.

648
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:49,573
I'm sorry.

649
00:31:49,746 --> 00:31:51,000
I can't help you.

650
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,740
If you and your family are
being threatened in any way...

651
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:59,241
Do you realize what the
president is offering you?

652
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:04,120
Treason is a capital offense,
Mr. Burnett.

653
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:08,353
If you don't cooperate with us right
now, I will make it my personal mission

654
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,393
to see that you pay the
ultimate price for your crimes.

655
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,362
I won't condone torture,
but in your case,

656
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:17,902
I would have no problem
with the death penalty.

657
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,533
Where's my lawyer?

658
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,102
??

659
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,822
Walker. MOSS: It's me.

660
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,360
That situation at the
hospital you told me about?

661
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,930
Yeah, I'm on it, Larry.

662
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:23,103
I traced a license plate
to an import/export firm.

663
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:24,132
Tell me.

664
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:27,201
The orderly I mentioned-- he just
joined up with about a dozen soldiers.

665
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,533
Africans. Heavily armed.

666
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,703
Where are you?

667
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,071
44543 Lambourne Marina,
near Johnson Park.

668
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:33,703
I'm in the warehouse basement.

669
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:37,043
Renee, we have intel on another
attack by Juma's people.

670
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,852
It's happening in D.C.,
sometime after 1900 hours.

671
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,282
This is it, Larry. No question.

672
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,882
All right, listen, sit tight.

673
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,883
I'm on my way with back.
Make it quick.

674
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:46,893
Janis, scramble a chopper.

675
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,492
On the roof in two minutes.

676
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:53,132
Okay. But also...
Janis, just do it.

677
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:54,631
This is Larry Moss.

678
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:56,532
Put me through to Metro Police.

679
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:58,362
Charters, Turner-- with me.

680
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:06,970
General, there is no
sign of my father.

681
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,983
I just spoke with him.

682
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:11,682
Unfortunately he won't
be able to join us.

683
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:12,682
Why not?

684
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:15,851
Because he got delayed in his
attempt to secure safe passage for us

685
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:17,082
from the country.

686
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:21,992
Then, sir, let me take his
place on the assault team.

687
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,263
Spoken like a true
Dubaku, Laurent.

688
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:27,131
But you are also my only reconnaissance
officer. But, General...

689
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,761
No, I need you on the perimeter
to provide intelligence

690
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:33,731
and also to disrupt whatever
rescue operations there may be.

691
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:37,003
Understood?

692
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,670
Understood, sir.

693
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:41,513
Make your final preparations.

694
00:34:41,677 --> 00:34:43,810
It is time for us to go.
Yes, sir.

695
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:50,922
Yeah?

696
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,450
Larry, hurry,
they're moving out.

697
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,050
We're ten minutes away.

698
00:34:54,227 --> 00:34:56,793
Is it possible that Juma
himself is leading this attack?

699
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:58,620
Juma? Why do you say that?

700
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,293
I know it sounds crazy,
but I swear that I just saw him.

701
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:02,530
What?! Here?!

702
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:04,630
Are you sure?
Unless he has an identical twin.

703
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:07,270
All right, I'll alert Homeland.

704
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:08,433
Good work.

705
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,971
Any idea what the
next target is?

706
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,043
Negative.

707
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:14,072
See if you get a fix on that.
But, listen, don't take any chances.

708
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,110
All right?

709
00:35:15,286 --> 00:35:17,843
I won't.

710
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:20,881
Sir.

711
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:23,252
You should have an EMT take
a look at you. I'm fine.

712
00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:24,852
Is Bauer in custody? Yes, sir.

713
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,553
He's in holding.
That'll be all.

714
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,062
Tony, it's Bill.

715
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,430
Bill. Jack's under arrest.

716
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,573
They've got him locked down
in a holding cell here.

717
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,243
Listen to me, Bill...
No, you listen.

718
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,572
We still don't know where
this attack's taking place.

719
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:47,010
Burnett didn't break?

720
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:49,501
No. They stopped Jack before
he could get the information.

721
00:37:49,678 --> 00:37:52,280
And Burnett didn't go for the
president's immunity deal.

722
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:55,280
You were the one who brought
Jack the intel, right?

723
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:56,720
That's right.

724
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:57,882
How real is it?

725
00:37:58,058 --> 00:37:58,950
Very.

726
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,822
Who was your contact?

727
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:03,320
It was a guy in Emerson's crew
with a direct line to Juma.

728
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:05,390
Any chance we get another
crack at this guy?

729
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:07,660
That's highly unlikely,
to say the least.

730
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,961
What are you telling me,
he's dead?

731
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:12,002
That's right?

732
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:14,833
I wish to God you'd
brought me in on this.

733
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:16,842
Jack didn't want to put
you in that position.

734
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:19,372
For what it's worth,
he was trying to protect you, Bill.

735
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:21,610
Did you have a fallback plan,
at least?

736
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:24,010
Immunity for Burnett
was the fallback.

737
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:26,050
That's it? Nothing else?

738
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:28,052
No.

739
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:30,150
Nothing.

740
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:35,322
I keep trying Renee,
and I keep getting her voice mail.

741
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:36,430
What the hell's going on?

742
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,762
There's something
wrong with her phone.

743
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:38,860
What do you mean,
something's wrong?

744
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:40,063
I just spoke to her
five minutes ago.

745
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,460
Can you triangulate
her position?

746
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:43,302
I can't. Why not?

747
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,602
There's no signal.

748
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:48,343
Either the battery's dead,
or her cell got damaged somehow.

749
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,373
All right, keep trying.

750
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,542
Get back to me when you
know something. Okay.

751
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:34,010
From our location it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

752
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:39,652
From this point forward,
we maintain radio silence

753
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:41,652
until the target is secure.

754
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:42,863
Understood?

755
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,992
Yes, sir. Understood.

756
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:53,401
You all have your assignments.

757
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:55,770
May God be with us.

758
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:21,062
Laurent, take your position.

759
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:23,231
Yes, sir.
