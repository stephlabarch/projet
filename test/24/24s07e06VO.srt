1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,330
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,330
Without you,Sangala
has no leader.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,460
These people,they work
for Dubaku,don't they?

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,000
Mr. Matobo,

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,700
we've accessed the air
intake to your safe room.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,800
We are feeding in
ammonium dysterate gas.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,600
If you do not open
the door,you will die.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,930
Ule...

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,030
Get him out of there!

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,100
Get the woman,too.

11
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:38,165
- Mr. Taylor. - Sam.

12
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,507
I can't stay long.

13
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:42,463
They killed Roger and made
it look like a suicide.

14
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,403
Who are they?

15
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:45,611
I don't know who they are.

16
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,421
They just said that they would
kill me if I said anything.

17
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,332
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

18
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:51,931
It's all here.

19
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:53,003
Account numbers,

20
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,530
trading records,everything
that he knew.

21
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:58,360
Roger was looking into
things he shouldn't have.

22
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,203
You killed my son.

23
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,932
It's Tetradyzine,sir.

24
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,202
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

25
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,302
The situation here
is in control.

26
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:13,960
- Are you tracking Ms.
Roth?  - Yeah.

27
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:16,333
Time to get her back
to her apartment.

28
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:18,961
Ms. Roth.

29
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:19,980
Henry Taylor sent me.

30
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:22,791
Mr. Taylor's been looking into
the matter you discussed.

31
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:24,761
He believes you're
in imminent danger.

32
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,822
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

33
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,653
Larry,it's Renee.
I've got a visual on them

34
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:34,410
loading Matobo and
his wife into a truck.

35
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:36,691
- Where the hell is SWAT? -
They're still about five minutes out.

36
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:37,662
Drop the gun.

37
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:40,560
Far as I can tell,she's alone.

38
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,091
Damn you,Bauer,you
son of a bitch.

39
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,131
Nichols wants her
out of the way

40
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:46,601
before we deliver Matobo.

41
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:48,063
Come on.

42
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:49,403
Yeah.

43
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,103
Turn around.

44
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:53,033
Trust me.
I'll get you through this alive.

45
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,721
I want three more
teams combing the site

46
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:13,962
where Matobo was abducted.

47
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,823
Pull them in from
regional if you have to.

48
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,250
We're going to
expand the search.

49
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:19,092
Coordinate with Metro Police to
set up a point-by-point grid

50
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,462
encompassing a ten-mile radius.

51
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:22,461
And talk with NSA.

52
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:23,800
I want to back all of this up

53
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,153
with synchronized
satellite sweeps.

54
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,131
- I'll do what I can.
- What does that mean?

55
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,461
Well,every time I ask for
something,they pull their

56
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:30,681
cloak-and-dagger nonsense.

57
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:31,722
I have to get approval

58
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:32,951
for every little scrap of data.

59
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:33,890
Janis,this isn't
easy for anybody.

60
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:34,861
Just,please,

61
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:35,863
make it happen.

62
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:36,762
Yes,sir.

63
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:40,502
We know that another
attack could be imminent.

64
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,230
The only way to stop it is
to find Almeida and Bauer

65
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,630
and take control
of the CIP device.

66
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:51,163
Um... for those of you

67
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,703
who haven't heard,

68
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:56,801
Renee Walker was abducted
by these people.

69
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:03,103
We're the only
chance she's got.

70
00:03:04,138 --> 00:03:06,130
So,let's get to work.

71
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,833
What have you got?

72
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:14,061
Audio forensics cleaned
up the recording.

73
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,361
Okay.

74
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:17,362
Walker is extraneous.

75
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:19,360
Kill her before you get here.

76
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:20,762
Okay,we'll be with you soon.

77
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:21,660
Be quick about it.

78
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:24,290
Dubaku's anxious to get his
hands on the Prime Minister.

79
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,923
Been combing through
it,looking for a tag

80
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,432
that will give up
their location.

81
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,401
- So far,nothing. -
Is there anybody else

82
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:30,832
you can put on this?

83
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,373
Larry,I don't think
it's worth it.

84
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:34,322
- There's nothing here.
- All right.

85
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:36,031
Fine,help Janis
coordinate with NSA.

86
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,661
I'm sorry about Renee,Larry.

87
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,102
She was a good agent.

88
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:41,830
We don't know that
she's dead yet!

89
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:44,162
All right?

90
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:12,260
Are you sure this is it?

91
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:13,833
She's going to run out of air.

92
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,703
Tony said near the backhoe.

93
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,702
Here,here.

94
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:21,963
I got her,Chloe.

95
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,203
I got her.

96
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:25,503
All right,here she is.

97
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,432
Here she is.

98
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,033
She's not breathing.

99
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,201
Give me the adrenaline.

100
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:06,861
It's all right.

101
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:09,833
You're okay... you're okay.

102
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,131
Who are you?

103
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,163
We're working with Jack.

104
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:15,931
told us where to find you.

105
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,262
It's gonna be okay.

106
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:18,932
Take deep breaths.

107
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:21,301
You're gonna be okay.

108
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,700
We're close to the
rendezvous point.

109
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:33,333
What's your ETA?

110
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,001
Good.

111
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:40,602
We'll see you then.

112
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:50,502
It's all set.

113
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,531
Nichols is on his way
with the diamonds.

114
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,803
Is something
bothering you,Jack?

115
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:05,933
No,I was wondering...

116
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:09,033
why you never told Tony
how you got him out of CTU.

117
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:14,961
How did you do it?

118
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:20,133
Christopher Anderson.

119
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,663
Christopher Anderson
tried to kill him.

120
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:25,661
Anderson had no intention
of killing Tony.

121
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,630
He purposely missed the
artery when he injected him.

122
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,302
It was just enough
to slow his heart

123
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,463
to the point where you'd
think that he was dead.

124
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:35,632
My job was to...

125
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:38,900
extract and revive him and...

126
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,833
use him against you.

127
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,862
And?

128
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:47,261
By the time I stabilized him,

129
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:49,030
you had already
killed Anderson.

130
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:50,560
Mission had failed.

131
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:52,760
So,my team went dark.

132
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,401
Why did he just let Tony go?

133
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,633
Tony chose to stay with us.

134
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:04,360
He was consumed

135
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:05,601
with hatred and anger

136
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,801
over what the government
had done to Michelle.

137
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:15,460
Anyway... I talked to him.

138
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:21,163
More importantly,I
listened to him.

139
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:26,300
Pretty soon,we came
to realize that...

140
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,562
I was right.

141
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,930
About what?

142
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,101
That the rules had changed.

143
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:41,400
And there was nothing
such as honor left.

144
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,105
That we would have to
take care of each other.

145
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,637
Like brothers.

146
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,703
Mr. Emerson.

147
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah?

148
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:58,833
We're almost there.

149
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:01,630
How is the deal gonna go down?

150
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:03,500
Don't worry,Jack.

151
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:05,032
You're about to find out.

152
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,300
Are you ready?

153
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,433
Yeah.

154
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,131
Are you sure?

155
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:29,460
Yeah.

156
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,233
Tony,Jack.

157
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:55,463
Go help Litvak with the door.

158
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,900
Go get the Matobos.

159
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah.

160
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:14,533
You better tell me what
the hell's going on.

161
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,060
Drop the gun,David.

162
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,660
You know,I just couldn't
figure out your play,

163
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:22,302
so I tried to give you some
time so you'd come clean,

164
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,033
'cause we are
like brothers,right,Tony?

165
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,761
Put the gun down,David.

166
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,503
You actually think
that I would let you

167
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,020
steal those diamonds from me?

168
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,100
It's not about the diamonds.

169
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,003
It's about killing
innocent people.

170
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,333
I can't let you finish this.

171
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:35,400
Take a shot.

172
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,430
Put down the weapon
or I will kill him.

173
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:38,291
Tony,take a shot!

174
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,223
- Shut up,Jack! -
Put it down,Tony,

175
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:42,092
- or he's dead. -
David,I don't want to kill you,

176
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,152
- but I will. - Damn it,Tony,

177
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,202
drop the...

178
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,031
You okay?

179
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,463
Yeah.

180
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,600
David.

181
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,762
Okay,you say that
Bauer and Almeida

182
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,961
are working undercover,but
CTU has been shut down,

183
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,660
so,I mean,if you're
telling the truth,

184
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,061
who's running this operation?

185
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,161
We are.

186
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:22,703
We're not working
with any agency.

187
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:25,151
We believe there's been
widespread infiltration...

188
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,303
... of the government...

189
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,161
... by Dubaku and
the Juma regime.

190
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:30,460
Okay.

191
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:31,683
I need to contact my boss.

192
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,922
- He needs to know that I'm okay.
- You can't do that.

193
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,060
Why not?

194
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:37,200
Dubaku has informants
in the FBI.

195
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,662
If they find out you're alive,

196
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,133
they'll know Jack is
working against them.

197
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,302
You don't know
who you can trust.

198
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:44,462
I can trust Agent Moss.

199
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:45,760
You're not listening to me.

200
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:47,062
You cannot contact the FBI.

201
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:48,852
You will jeopardize
this operation,

202
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:50,301
and I won't let you do that.

203
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:52,401
Well,I don't work for
you,I work for Larry.

204
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:53,463
Now give me a phone.

205
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,003
Sit still,please.

206
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:58,263
We're nearing the endgame.

207
00:10:58,438 --> 00:10:59,861
Dubaku is the key...

208
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:02,220
... to finding out who
in the government...

209
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:04,401
... has been corrupted.

210
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:06,333
Luckily,we have
something he wants.

211
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:09,363
Matobo.

212
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,302
He's our best chance
to locate Dubaku,

213
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:13,433
reacquire the CIP module

214
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:15,623
and get to the bottom of
the government corruption.

215
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:18,832
Until all that happens,you
have to stay dead.

216
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,100
Yeah.

217
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:23,403
Did you find Agent Walker?

218
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:24,413
Yeah,we got her,Jack.

219
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:25,551
She's fine. Where are you?

220
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,533
Northwoods Airfield.

221
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,260
Litvak is dead.
Emerson's been wounded.

222
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:30,602
Nichols is en route.
I need you to get over here now.

223
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:31,811
Have you talked to Matobo?

224
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,722
- Not yet. -
He needs to agree to this,Jack.

225
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:34,961
We can't do it without him.

226
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:37,260
I'll get him to agree.
Just get over here.

227
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,602
It's all right.

228
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,703
What the hell is going on?

229
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,602
Mr. Matobo,I'm not
going to hurt you...

230
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:55,850
... or your wife.
I know how scared you are...

231
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,191
... and I know what
you've been through,

232
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,430
but we are here to help you.

233
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:00,431
What in God's name
are you talking about?

234
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:03,320
- You kidnapped us. -
We had to to gain Dubaku's trust.

235
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:04,630
That's the man we're after.

236
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,100
We're trying to stop him.

237
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:08,432
I want to call my people.

238
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,933
I can't let you do that,not
until you hear me out.

239
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,601
Sir,we have a plan
to stop Dubaku,

240
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,260
but we can't do it
without your help.

241
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:16,803
We don't have much time.

242
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:18,431
Please.

243
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,062
Come with me.

244
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:24,200
Mr. Dubaku.

245
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:27,172
I'm heading...

246
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,723
... to the meeting place.

247
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:29,650
They're bringing Matobo now.

248
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:30,662
And his wife?

249
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:31,903
Both of them.

250
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:35,560
Once you have Matobo,you
know what to do.

251
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,202
Emerson's team is
now a loose end.

252
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:38,200
Tie it off.

253
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,132
Are you sure about this?

254
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:43,663
We may need their
services again.

255
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:45,332
I would rather
keep my diamonds,

256
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:49,831
and Almeida has proved
to be a liability.

257
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,700
So.

258
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:54,261
Any response from
the White House?

259
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,832
Not the one we wanted.

260
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,961
American forces are
still in position.

261
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:01,203
President Taylor must
know we have Matobo.

262
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,400
She can't attack
Sangala without him.

263
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,962
The country will collapse.

264
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,163
Taylor may be holding
out hope that she can

265
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,800
somehow retrieve Matobo.

266
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:11,933
Or she doesn't believe

267
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:15,460
we are willing to
carry out our threats.

268
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:18,230
She will only respond when
there are dead Americans.

269
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,061
I'll call you when
I have Matobo.

270
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:21,563
These gentlemen are

271
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:22,963
at your command.

272
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:32,132
There are still 1,300
planes in the air.

273
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:33,961
Which region do
you want targeted?

274
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:36,960
Washington DC.

275
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:57,930
Yeah.

276
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:58,901
Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,102
I understand,Bob.

278
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:04,260
All right,thanks.

279
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,430
That was Bob Cornell at NSA.

280
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,290
They've detected
another firewall breach.

281
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:10,260
There's been another attack?

282
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:13,061
Not yet,but they believe the
CIP device is being utilized.

283
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:17,562
We have to assume Dubaku is
initiating another attack.

284
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:20,261
It's safe to say this won't
be another warning shot.

285
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:22,700
This time Dubaku's gonna
make sure that people die.

286
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:28,061
I want to speak personally

287
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,862
with all first responders
across the country.

288
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,640
They need to know to
brace for the worst

289
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,650
and that they have
our full support.

290
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,560
Instead of preparing for it,

291
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:37,801
maybe we should be trying

292
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:40,703
to preempt this
attack,Madam President.

293
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,301
The deadline Dubaku gave us

294
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,963
for withdrawing our troops
from Sangala has passed,

295
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,701
but if we made some
kind of gesture...

296
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:49,602
began an immediate pullback,

297
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:50,960
it might keep Dubaku

298
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:52,491
from pulling the trigger.

299
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,683
We've discussed this,Ethan.

300
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,130
It's not an option.

301
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,732
I won't be dictated
to by this madman.

302
00:14:57,908 --> 00:15:01,500
Madam President,we can't
invade Sangala without Matobo,

303
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,100
and there's very little chance
of him being recovered.

304
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,063
Why are we risking
American lives?

305
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,160
I've told you my reasons.

306
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,663
Withdraw our forces
before it's too late.

307
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:19,322
You asked me to be your advisor
because you trust my opinion.

308
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:20,661
Well,I'm giving it to you now.

309
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,762
We're out of options.

310
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,003
We're not,Ethan.

311
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,702
The NSA is

312
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:26,932
attempting to localize

313
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:29,500
what part of the infrastructure
is being targeted,

314
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:33,201
and the FBI is still trying
to track down the CIP device.

315
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,331
I'll keep an open channel
with both agencies.

316
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,300
I'll keep you apprised.

317
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:43,662
Good.

318
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:57,231
Let me see it.

319
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:58,230
Let me see it!

320
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:03,903
This wasn't about
the diamonds,David.

321
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:06,763
You crossed a line I
wasn't willing to cross.

322
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:10,203
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,701
You're looking
for forgiveness...

324
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,202
Go to hell.

325
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:20,932
You...

326
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:23,700
live with it.

327
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,260
You're asking us
to risk our lives

328
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:32,931
to be delivered into Dubaku's
hands,based on nothing

329
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:34,153
but what you have told us.

330
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:35,750
Everything I have told
you is the truth.

331
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:38,232
Dubaku is in this country,and
we need to find him.

332
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:39,702
You have as much at stake

333
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:40,702
as we do.

334
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,202
He's attacked both
our countries.

335
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,700
Listen to him,Ule.

336
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,603
You told me yourself
President Taylor

337
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:48,763
will not commit
forces to Sangala

338
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:50,701
until these attacks
are stopped.

339
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,662
But how can we trust this man?

340
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:55,432
Because he has no
reason to lie.

341
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:06,701
I will do what you
ask,but I will go alone.

342
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,302
Dubaku wants you and your wife.

343
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:09,730
- That's the deal. - No.

344
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:12,732
I will not put my wife in
the hands of that monster.

345
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,262
I will be honest with you,sir.

346
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,733
He wants your wife as leverage.

347
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:16,801
If I don't deliver

348
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,202
both of you,he will back out.

349
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:19,260
Leverage.

350
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:20,833
You mean he wants
to torture her

351
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,021
to make me tell him what I
know about the resistance

352
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,700
- in Sangala? - Yes,sir.

353
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:26,262
And we won't let that happen.

354
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:27,430
We'll be following you.

355
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:28,960
Still,you can't promise me

356
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:31,102
that she won't be
harmed,can you?

357
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,130
Can you?

358
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:38,563
I won't do it.

359
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,230
May I speak with my husband?

360
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,303
Of course,Ma'am.

361
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:48,803
I want to do this,Ule.

362
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,163
- What? - I am ashamed

363
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:53,401
that I opened the door
to the safe room.

364
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:55,862
I want to do what is
right for our country.

365
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,460
Absolutely not.

366
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,761
You can't stop me,Ule.

367
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:01,461
Sangala

368
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,163
is my country,too.

369
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:04,900
I have been by your side

370
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:07,133
for 22 years.

371
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,960
I am not going to leave it now.

372
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,160
Mr. Bauer.

373
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:28,600
We will do this together.

374
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:30,903
Thank you.

375
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,500
You are both very brave.

376
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:34,630
We'll need to go soon.

377
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,102
Excuse me for one moment.

378
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,132
Tony.

379
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,132
The Matobos are
gonna work with us.

380
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:51,663
We've got to go.

381
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:58,663
Tony.

382
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,232
Let's get the bodies
out of sight.

383
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:11,331
Ok.

384
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,332
We're locked onto the FAA node.

385
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,063
Begin rerouting the targets.

386
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:29,230
RSA 471,turn right,

387
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,002
heading 274.

388
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:33,400
Descend and maintain
flight level

389
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:34,601
270.

390
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:35,800
Call the White House.

391
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:46,102
The latest report from the NSA.

392
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,203
I can summarize it

393
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,332
- for you. - Go ahead.

394
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:50,700
They've had no luck

395
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,860
in localizing the
firewall breach.

396
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:54,261
Dubaku's attack

397
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:55,332
could hit anywhere.

398
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:57,331
What about the FBI?

399
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:01,360
They've dedicated
every available agent

400
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,732
to the manhunt for Matobo.

401
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:04,630
They're no closer
to finding him.

402
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,761
Uh,excuse me.

403
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:11,433
We're at a dead
end,Madam President.

404
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:13,061
You need to order the pullback,

405
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:15,200
and you need to order it now.

406
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,663
Can it be traced?

407
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:18,531
Okay.

408
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:20,101
Hold on.

409
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,301
- Madam President.
- What is it,Tim?

410
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,422
I've just been forwarded
a scrambled call.

411
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,062
It's from Colonel Dubaku.

412
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,302
He's demanding to
speak with you.

413
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,131
I'll take it.

414
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,063
This is

415
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:41,233
President Taylor.

416
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,802
Madam President...
I'm disappointed

417
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:46,301
that you have not taken
my demands seriously.

418
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:49,862
Your forces are still in
position near my country.

419
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,133
Colonel Dubaku,I
assure you we've had

420
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:55,060
very serious discussions
regarding your demands.

421
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:57,401
The time for
discussions is over.

422
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,903
The deadline for your forces

423
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,762
to begin their
withdrawal has passed.

424
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:04,632
Go to the window.

425
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,363
Look to the
southwest,Madam President.

426
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:09,002
What?

427
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,932
See what you have done.

428
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:13,633
Colonel Dubaku,if
you're endangering

429
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,100
one American life...

430
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:16,300
Oh,my God.

431
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,760
Go,Madam President.

432
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:30,733
You son of a bitch.

433
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:33,400
Comply with my demands
within the hour,

434
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,933
or 10,000 more
Americans will die.

435
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:14,431
Is the Cabinet still assembled?

436
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,862
Yes,Madam President.

437
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:43,763
It was Flight 131
out of Chicago.

438
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:46,030
240 passengers,ten
crew members.

439
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:47,861
They collided with
a small commuter jet

440
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,561
carrying 21 people.

441
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:51,033
There's also a high probability

442
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,703
of casualties on the ground.

443
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:55,500
The aircraft went down in
a residential neighborhood

444
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,533
near Edgeborough.

445
00:22:57,706 --> 00:22:59,533
Thank you.

446
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:07,852
We've also just gotten word
that Congressman Brighten

447
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:09,163
and his wife

448
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,721
may have been on 131.
We're waiting for confirmation.

449
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:13,462
How many planes are
still in the air?

450
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:15,503
Over 1,300.

451
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:17,830
Madam President,

452
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:19,863
this is a catastrophic
loss of American lives,

453
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:21,361
and it's only
going to get worse.

454
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,220
We have to withdraw our forces
before the next deadline.

455
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,261
I'm forced to agree,

456
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:25,500
Madam President.

457
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:32,800
Go ahead,Tim.

458
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,502
I want to hear what you think.

459
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:38,661
We're simply not prepared
to contend with the scope

460
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:40,533
of damage these
people can inflict.

461
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,132
The tragedy we've
just witnessed

462
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:42,771
is nothing compared

463
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:45,320
to what could happen if
they begin targeting

464
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:48,930
power grids,nuclear facilities.

465
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,703
We're talking deaths in
the hundreds of thousands.

466
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:52,912
All in support of a policy

467
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:55,190
that cannot possibly
succeed without Matobo.

468
00:23:55,307 --> 00:23:57,101
He's the only man who
can stabilize Sangala.

469
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:58,031
Without him,

470
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,031
the entire operation
is pointless.

471
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:13,560
There's still a chance

472
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,160
that Prime Minister
Matobo will be recovered.

473
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:19,562
And while that chance
exists,I'm not giving in.

474
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:22,260
Admiral Smith,your strike force

475
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:24,832
will remain in position and
at full battle readiness.

476
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:25,811
Yes,Madam President.

477
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:27,351
Madam President,you're
guaranteeing

478
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,701
another attack on our country.

479
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:32,402
We will not be blackmailed,Joe,and
we will not be held hostage.

480
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:34,533
This country does not
negotiate with terrorists.

481
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:36,533
Tell that to the
families of the dead!

482
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:39,030
Do you have any idea what
the public reaction will be

483
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,523
when word gets out that
these are acts of terrorism?

484
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:43,223
Brought about by your
reckless foreign policy?

485
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:45,392
I can guarantee there will be
a call for your impeachment...

486
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:46,230
That's enough,Joe.

487
00:24:46,405 --> 00:24:47,853
I will not stand by
and let this happen.

488
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:48,903
Then you can turn in

489
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,003
your resignation,Joe,

490
00:24:50,106 --> 00:24:52,361
because I'm not
changing my mind.

491
00:24:52,537 --> 00:24:56,433
Now sit down or leave.

492
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:10,500
I'm sorry,Madam President.

493
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,563
You people think about
what you're doing here...

494
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:17,562
about the cost you're
willing to pay.

495
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,330
Gentlemen,

496
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:42,763
ladies...

497
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:46,362
I know that there
are many of you here

498
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:47,851
who agree with
Secretary Stevens.

499
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,363
If I can't alleviate
your doubts,

500
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:55,660
I can at least help
you to understand

501
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:57,601
my reasoning.

502
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:03,801
When I took the oath of
office,I swore to myself,

503
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:07,863
and to the American people,that
this country would continue

504
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:10,832
to be a force for
good in this world.

505
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:15,032
We're a nation
founded on ideals,

506
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:19,832
and those ideals are
being challenged today.

507
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:26,160
Now how we respond will not only
define this administration,

508
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:29,162
but an entire generation.

509
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:33,830
And not just
Americans,but Sangalans,

510
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:39,032
and anyone else who looks to
us for guidance and strength.

511
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:43,902
I won't fail them...

512
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:47,403
and neither will you.

513
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:58,333
We're in for some
tough times ahead.

514
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:01,232
Let's make sure we're ready.

515
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,660
Thank you,everyone.

516
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,812
Hey,Jack.

517
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:11,050
They're over there.
I want you to put a wire

518
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:12,881
on Mr.
Matobo as fast as you can. Go.

519
00:28:19,118 --> 00:28:20,781
You okay?

520
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:23,382
What do you think,Jack?

521
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:25,513
You shot me and
buried me alive.

522
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,180
If we hadn't,Emerson
would have killed you.

523
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,513
I'm sorry we had to
keep you in the dark,

524
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,953
- but we didn't have a choice.
- Yes,you did.

525
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:34,511
You could have trusted me.

526
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:37,212
If I had told you
everything back at the FBI,

527
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:39,653
would you have believed me?

528
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:56,511
Have a seat,please,sir.

529
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,281
What's that?

530
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,951
It's a transmitter.

531
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:14,181
I'll be affixing it
to one of your teeth.

532
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,912
We'll know exactly where
you are at all times.

533
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:19,982
You won't be alone.

534
00:29:20,155 --> 00:29:21,312
Are you with the FBI?

535
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:23,611
No,I'm a stay-at-home mom.

536
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:26,951
Open your mouth,please.

537
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:28,410
Wider.

538
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,852
Good.

539
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:31,281
Chloe accessed the FBI server.

540
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:33,380
Dubaku brought down two planes

541
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:34,982
just outside the capital.

542
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:36,353
Over 270 people

543
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:38,182
were killed.

544
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:40,041
He's threatened to
kill 10,000 more.

545
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:41,602
We have less than
an hour to stop it.

546
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:42,700
How long before
Nichols gets here?

547
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:43,653
Ten minutes.

548
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:46,381
- Here's your com. - Thanks.

549
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:57,612
You all right?

550
00:29:57,786 --> 00:30:00,012
Yeah,just a little dizzy.

551
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:01,111
You should take a seat.

552
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:03,213
I'm fine.

553
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,351
Hey,come on. Take a seat.

554
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:10,810
So it's really true?

555
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:13,013
Yeah.

556
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:15,251
I've devoted my
life to the Bureau

557
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:17,660
and you just expect me to
believe that it's corrupted...

558
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:19,402
that the entire government's
been corrupted?

559
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,380
Not all of them.

560
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:21,710
But until we find out who,

561
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,010
we can't trust anyone.

562
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:25,310
And the four of you really
think you can stop this?

563
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:28,852
We have to.
It's as simple as that.

564
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,152
Ethan...

565
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:37,553
Can we...?

566
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:41,980
The president

567
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:43,280
is completely alone on this,

568
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:45,043
and she's going to get a
lot of Americans killed.

569
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:47,313
You've got to find a way to
talk some sense into her.

570
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:49,112
We're both on the
same side here,Tim.

571
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:50,682
And I'm going to need your help

572
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:52,612
if we're going to
change her mind.

573
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:54,381
How do you propose we do that?

574
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,382
There is someone
she'll listen to.

575
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:01,010
Maybe we can convince
him to help us.

576
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:54,013
Go ahead.

577
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:55,110
I just dropped her off.

578
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:56,083
She's on her way up.

579
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:58,410
Okay,stay in the
car and keep watch.

580
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,280
I'll call you when it's done.

581
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:57,353
Mr. Taylor,how did
you get in here?

582
00:32:58,915 --> 00:33:03,851
Um... the agent you sent
just brought me by to get

583
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,611
a few of my things for...

584
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:11,513
Mr. Taylor,are you all right?

585
00:33:16,818 --> 00:33:19,753
Mr. Taylor,are you okay?

586
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:24,781
Mr. Taylor,unless you tell me

587
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:28,310
what's wrong,I
don't know what...

588
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:34,952
Help me. Please.

589
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:00,583
Yes,Mr. Kanin.

590
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:02,851
Agent Gedge,I'm looking
for Henry Taylor.

591
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:04,473
He's not answering his phone.

592
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,081
Is he with you?

593
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:07,911
You can't talk with
him right now,sir.

594
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,353
Why not? Where is he?

595
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:11,180
Well,he's meeting
with Samantha Roth

596
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:12,680
in her apartment,sir.

597
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:13,682
For what possible

598
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:15,012
reason?

599
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:16,813
I don't know,sir.
He didn't tell me.

600
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:18,750
Why aren't you with him?

601
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:20,380
Mr. Taylor insisted

602
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:22,011
on meeting with her alone,sir.

603
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,151
I'm in the car.

604
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,682
I'm just outside the building.

605
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:25,552
I don't give a damn

606
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:26,411
what he insisted.

607
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,543
We went through this,Agent Gedge.
You were

608
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:29,842
supposed to keep
him away from her.

609
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:31,613
What the hell were
you thinking?

610
00:34:31,718 --> 00:34:32,781
I'm sorry,sir.

611
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:34,383
I'm not interested
in your apology.

612
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:35,610
Just pull him out of there

613
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:38,451
and have him phone me
as soon as possible.

614
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:10,513
Don't try to speak,sir.

615
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:12,512
There is nothing enough to say.

616
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:43,710
We will wait here.

617
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:46,713
All right.

618
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,112
They're coming.

619
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,550
- One car from the service road.
- How many people?

620
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:59,511
I can't tell.
The windows are tinted.

621
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:00,951
Copy that.

622
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:27,481
How are you doing,Tony?

623
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:30,480
All right.

624
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:34,180
I was glad to hear
you're still with us.

625
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,481
Where's Emerson?

626
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,653
You're not going to be
dealing with him today.

627
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:40,511
What do you mean?

628
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:42,053
He's dead.

629
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:44,553
So's Litvak and Bauer.

630
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:46,811
I got them in a back room.
You want to say hi?

631
00:36:46,986 --> 00:36:50,752
You better start telling me
what the hell is going on.

632
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:55,852
I decided I'd rather
not split the cut.

633
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:56,780
I don't understand.

634
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:58,670
I thought you and
Emerson were friends

635
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:02,213
Yeah,that was before he left
me to rot with the FBI.

636
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:09,251
You want Matobo or not?

637
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:10,252
Where is he?

638
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,550
Close.

639
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:13,513
I want to see him,and his wife.

640
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:15,852
Diamonds.

641
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:48,711
Matobo.

642
00:37:52,488 --> 00:37:53,853
He's in the back of the truck.

643
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:13,150
Keep your tracks clean.

644
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:14,580
We might call on you again.

645
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,353
Okay,then.

646
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:44,683
Let's put that behind us.

647
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:47,982
You got what you want.

648
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:50,251
Now,get the hell out of here.

649
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,181
Now!

650
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,153
Clear.

651
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,183
- Chloe. - Jack,I've got him.

652
00:39:36,356 --> 00:39:38,951
Get everyone ready to move out.

653
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:13,851
Gedge...

654
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,851
Gedge.

655
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,452
Don't do this.

656
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:59,212
Please...

657
00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:09,953
The White House still
has not complied.

658
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:13,253
American forces are
still in position.

659
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:16,013
I think this president
is not just stubborn;

660
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,412
she's insane.

661
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:18,810
What do you intend to do?

662
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:21,011
Exactly what we promised.

663
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:22,652
We're ready,sir.

664
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:24,112
I'll see you in a moment.

665
00:42:28,356 --> 00:42:29,713
Where is the target located?

666
00:42:29,888 --> 00:42:30,981
Kidron,Ohio.

667
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:32,310
Population?

668
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:33,612
30,000.

669
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:35,280
The processing
facility is located

670
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:37,380
two miles west of
the town center.

671
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:40,083
Casualties will be
high,about 18,000.

672
00:42:47,557 --> 00:42:48,953
Begin.
