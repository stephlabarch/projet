00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,000
Previously on 24

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,800
This is counel Eka Dubako

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,200
We have the CIP device

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,700
We demand

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,500
the complete withdrawl of the U.S. Naval Strike Force

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
by this time tomorrow.

10
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:29,000
You are recalling 
the invasion force.

11
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:31,105
Well, that determination
has yet to be made.

12
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:32,307
I implore you,

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,503
do not abandon my country.

14
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,002
It's Samantha Roth.

15
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:38,703
<i>She says</i>
 <i>she has new information</i>

16
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:39,901
<i>regarding my son's death.</i>

17
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,901
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

18
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:44,602
He uncovered
other blind accounts,

19
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,401
accounts that were traced
to a senior member

20
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,100
of your wife's
administration.

21
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:49,703
It's all here.

22
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:51,800
Account numbers,
trading records,

23
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,103
everything that he knew.

24
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:55,203
Bauer must have worked out
this escape

25
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,502
with Almeida's people.

26
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:57,401
That son of a bitch played me.

27
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,403
Had me believing
the Bureau was compromised--

28
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:00,800
someone on the inside
working against us.

29
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:02,603
I realize now
it was him all along.

30
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:05,101
MOSS:
 <i>He played us both.</i>

31
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:06,403
I'm going to make
this right, Larry.

32
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:09,003
Whatever it takes,
I will find Bauer and Almeida.

33
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:11,501
You're out of time, Mr. Tanner.
Tell me what you know.

34
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:13,301
I'm not going to tell u
a damn thing.

35
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:14,502
(groans)
Where is Almeida?

36
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:17,103
Tanner says Almeida's crew
has a plan to abduct

37
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,102
former Prime Minister
of Sangala.

38
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:19,701
Matobo?

39
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,103
When?
Pretty much now.

40
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:22,700
Why didn't you call
the authorities?

41
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,600
BUCHANAN:
He couldn't, Jack.
Why not?

42
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:27,101
He found out Emerson's client
was Dubaku.

43
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:30,101
That's who you believe has
agents inside the government.

44
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:32,102
Dubaku is the key
to this thing, Jack.

45
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,101
If we're going to
uncover the conspiracy,

46
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:36,303
we have to get to him
before he leaves the U.S.

47
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,503
ALMEIDA:
I got away from the FBI.
Yeah, I heard.

48
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:41,600
I also heard it was Jack Bauer
who broke you out.

49
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:42,603
He's on board now.

50
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,400
The package is a person.

51
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,002
EMERSON:
Former Prime Minister Matobo
of Sangala.

52
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:51,202
The assignment is to grab him,
deliver him to Colonel Dubaku.

53
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:51,800
(explosion)

54
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,403
Where's Matobo?!
Where is he?!

55
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:03,301
It's a safe room;
reinforced concrete.

56
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:04,902
Jack, we leave here
without Matobo,

57
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:06,900
we lose our only chance
of getting at Dubaku.

58
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:13,702
???

59
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,200
Matobo's security chief

60
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:17,903
said there's a safe room
at his residence.

61
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,303
They should have him
and his wife locked down by now.

62
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,102
They'll be safe
till your team gets there.

63
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,200
Your priority is to grab Almeida
and bring him back here.

64
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,403
We'll make every effort
to use nonlethal force,

65
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:29,900
but Almeida's crew
is ex-military.

66
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:30,800
They're going to be hard
to subdue

67
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:32,202
unless my men can return fire.

68
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,602
I understand you'll be
exposing your men,

69
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,500
but it's a risk
you need to take.
Sir...

70
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:38,001
Almeida is the only
viable lead we've got

71
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,903
to retrieve
the CIP device.

72
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:42,301
You need to bring him in alive,
is that understood?

73
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,003
Understood.

74
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:46,201
Let's move out.

75
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:47,903
We'll get our
updates in the van.

76
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:49,302
(pained grunting)

77
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,301
Open the safe room.

78
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,102
(grunts)

79
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:01,500
I will keep going until
you open the door.

80
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:04,202
(panting):
I've already told you.

81
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:07,202
Once it's closed, you can only
open it from the inside.

82
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:08,803
Do whatever
you want to me,

83
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,102
but you will never
get into that room.

84
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:15,503
(blows landing, Eto'o grunts)

85
00:03:16,307 --> 00:03:17,603
We've got to get Matobo.

86
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,303
Without him, we've got nothing.

87
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:20,301
I know.

88
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,601
Find a way in yet?
No.

89
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:30,803
Litvak, any luck

90
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,200
reconnecting the intercom?

91
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,001
Not yet.

92
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:35,001
I'm working on it.

93
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:44,703
(phone ringing)
Sir, this just came in...

94
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm in the middle
of a field op, Erika.

95
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,101
I don't really have
a lot of time right now.

96
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:48,302
It's from the
attorney general.

97
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:49,602
I think you should
make time for this.

98
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,900
What is it?
Tanner's lawyers are
filing a complaint

99
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,102
against the Bureau.

100
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:04,600
(speed dialing)

101
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:11,002
(phone rings)

102
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:12,900
Walker.

103
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:13,800
MOSS:
Renee, it's me.

104
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,702
I'm less than 15 minutes away
from Matobo's house.

105
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,200
When I get there,
I'll recon for the Tac Team.

106
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:18,303
Stop a second.

107
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,003
What?

108
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,601
This information about Matobo
being abducted...

109
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:24,902
tell me how you got it.

110
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,803
You know how I got it--
I questioned Tanner.

111
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,001
You questioned him?

112
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:29,102
Yeah.

113
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:31,600
Tanner's lawyers
are saying

114
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:33,900
you locked them
out of his hospital room,

115
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,500
then cut off
his ventilator.

116
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:37,601
They said you
applied pressure

117
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,603
to his gunshot wound.

118
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:39,900
We needed Almeida's location.

119
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,601
Tanner was not about
to cooperate.

120
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:43,500
So you tortured him.

121
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,600
What the hell were you thinking?

122
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,402
I got the information we needed.

123
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,700
Information that
may not even be valid.

124
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:55,902
You know as well as I do,

125
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,800
coercive interrogation
is unreliable.

126
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,503
No, Tanner was not lying.

127
00:05:59,805 --> 00:05:00,600
You know that?
How do you know

128
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,402
he wasn't just telling you
what you wanted to hear?

129
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,201
I'll find out when I
get to Matobo's house.

130
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:05,301
No, you're not
going to Matobo's.

131
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:06,902
You're coming back
here to the office.

132
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,001
The attorney general
is sending somebody here,

133
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:10,400
and you're going to tell him
everything that happened.

134
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:11,202
Larry...

135
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:13,501
it's my fault that Bauer 
and Almeida are still at large.

136
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,103
Please, let me play this out.

137
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:16,203
I will deal
with the consequences

138
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:18,003
after we find the CIP device.

139
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:20,002
No, the field team is on the
way, they can handle this.

140
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:21,903
Renee,

141
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,802
get back here now.

142
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,001
I'm sorry, Larry,

143
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:28,500
but I need to make this right.

144
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:30,305
Renee?

145
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:34,707
(turns off phone)

146
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,603
Damn it.

147
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,103
I'm glad you're all right, babe.

148
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,000
The flight attendant said
something about us getting

149
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:49,701
a priority clearance to land.

150
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,102
Uh, you got lucky.

151
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:52,600
Did I?

152
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:55,102
I mean, it happened
just after we spoke,

153
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:57,800
so I thought maybe you had
something to do with it.

154
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,601
Me? How could I
have done anything?

155
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:02,100
Listen, I might
be late tonight.

156
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,601
There's a lot
going on at work.

157
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:05,503
I haven't seen you in a week.

158
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,801
I thought we could spend
some time together.

159
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:10,300
Dinner, and maybe...

160
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,101
...you know.

161
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,403
Sorry, I have to go.
I have to get back to work.

162
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:15,502
Call me later.

163
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:16,600
Okay.

164
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:20,803
Did you deploy the field teams?

165
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:21,803
Yeah, they just left.

166
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:22,801
We need to coordinate

167
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,902
with Matobo's security chief--
get him back on the line.

168
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:30,700
(keypad beeping)

169
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:32,403
(dial tone drones)

170
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,101
(hangs up phone)

171
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,900
These people, they work
for Dubaku, don't they?

172
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:42,003
Possibly.

173
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,103
Yes, probably.

174
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,300
But if they wanted me dead,
I would be dead.

175
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,500
Then what do they want?

176
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,803
Names.

177
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,103
Names?

178
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,403
Of my allies inside Sangala.

179
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:57,903
You would die before you exposed
them, they know that.

180
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:59,301
Yes, they do, but..

181
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,500
Then it's me.

182
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:11,401
It's me.

183
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,101
They want to use me
to get you to ta?

184
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:16,500
Don't worry.

185
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:18,803
We'll be safe in here
until they leave.

186
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:21,400
Ule, I'm scared.

187
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,601
Alama, listen to me.

188
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,102
We need to stay calm.

189
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,003
We'll be fine.

190
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:26,501
The FBI knows we are here.

191
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:27,800
They'll come for us soon.

192
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:29,500
Okay?

193
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:32,503
EMERSON (over intercom):
Mr. Matobo?

194
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:39,302
I know you can see and hear me.

195
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,900
Come out now
and nobody has to get hurt.

196
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,301
You are wasting your time.

197
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:48,403
(cocks gun)

198
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,900
Come out now or
I will kill your man.

199
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,903
You have one minute.

200
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:02,603
Fifty...

201
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:08,502
I am prepared to die, sir.

202
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:11,101
For you and for Sangala.

203
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:18,201
Eto'o is right.

204
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:21,202
Without you,
Sangala has no leader.

205
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:23,300
The people need <i>you.</i>

206
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:30,903
30 seconds.

207
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,302
Eto'o's courage is stronger
than your threats.

208
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,103
He is willing to die.

209
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:41,000
And for that sacrifice
he has my eternal gratitude,

210
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:43,601
and the gratitude
of the people of Sangala.

211
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,202
Ten seconds.

212
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:58,400
Time's up.

213
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,900
(phone ringing)

214
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,101
(phone line ringing)

215
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,003
I just got through to him
15 minutes ago.

216
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,002
Well, he's not answering now.

217
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:19,603
Then get me someone
else at the residence.

218
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:23,003
It's the FBI.

219
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:28,103
Does the FBI know we're here?

220
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:34,701
Tanner.

221
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,301
He's the only one who knew
we were grabbing Matobo.

222
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:38,003
He must have talked.

223
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:39,703
Sir, we need to go
before they get here.

224
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:40,901
Not without Matobo.

225
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,503
Those walls are
two feet thick.

226
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:43,901
Even if we blow a hole
with a shaped charge,

227
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:45,400
they'll kill everyone inside.

228
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:46,700
I think I found a way.

229
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:49,002
Yeah? Like what?

230
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:49,102
We can gas them out.

231
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,001
We don't have anything!
We'll find something!

232
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:52,402
There's a ventilation system

233
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:53,702
running straight
into the safe room.

234
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,400
If I can feed the gas through
that, it'll flush 'em out.

235
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:56,903
LITVAK:
The FBI is coming!

236
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,800
They won't be here
for at least 15 minutes.

237
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:00,002
What are you talking about?
How do you know?

238
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,701
If they knew anything
before we got here,

239
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,303
they'd have evacuated Matobo.

240
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,303
That's just guesswork.

241
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:07,001
The tac teams are staged
out of the DC branch office,

242
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,903
That's 21 miles from here, 
with traffic.

243
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,603
That gives us at
least 15 minutes.

244
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:11,701
We're not leaving
without Matobo.

245
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:13,200
That's what Dubaku
is paying us for.

246
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,201
You're not seriously
considering...
Shut up!

247
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:17,602
What kind of gas are
you talking about?

248
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:18,402
Ammonium dysterate.

249
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:20,402
We can make it from basic
household products.

250
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,002
Do it.
Tony, give me a hand.

251
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,401
Jack, you do know ammonium
dysterate could kill them

252
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,801
as easily as flush them out.

253
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,403
That's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

254
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:37,901
Delivering Matobo
is our only chance

255
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:40,001
to get to Dubaku
and the CIP device.

256
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,403
I got it. Grab those bowls.

257
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:23,002
Gotten into the vent yet?

258
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,800
Yeah! The fbi will
be here any minute.

259
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:11,802
Mr. Matobo...

260
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:15,901
We've accessed the air
intake to your safe room.

261
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:18,000
We are now feeding in
ammonium dysterate gas.

262
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,503
If you do not open
the door you will die.

263
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,503
I believe that you are
willing to sacrifice your life.

264
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:28,002
But are you also willing To
sentence your wife to death?

265
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:34,800
Ule...

266
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,000
You know what they will do
if we open the door.

267
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:46,701
I know.

268
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,600
I can't let them
force me to name names.

269
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:53,500
Our cause is more
important than we are.

270
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,303
Take my hand.

271
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,603
- Janis gold?
- Yes?

272
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm raymond howell From
the attorney general's office,

273
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:18,802
Is there some place
we can talk?

274
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,001
About?

275
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,600
What happened At
the hospital, ms. Gold.

276
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:24,801
Agent walker's being accused
Of torturing your suspect.

277
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:25,803
He's not my suspect,

278
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,902
i have no idea what happened After
i left that room, i am not involved.

279
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,802
The suspect's attorneys claim that
you sent them To the wrong hospital room,

280
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,202
To buy agent walker
more time.

281
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:36,502
So it sounds to me like
you were involved.

282
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,900
This is going to have to wait.
Janis, i need you on comm, now.

283
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:41,801
Agent moss, The a.G. Personally
initiated this investigation.

284
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:43,701
Howell, Open your eyes,
we have a situation.

285
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,402
She cannot deal with
this right now.

286
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,500
Please, Have a seat. Come here.

287
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,602
What's going on?

288
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:51,201
We think almeida and his crew
may already at matobo's.

289
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,601
And we can't reach
renee to warn her.

290
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:53,901
Why can't you reach her?

291
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,400
When i heard
what she did To tanner,

292
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,801
i ordered her back to headquarters
To talk to the a.G's office,

293
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,103
And she, uh, refused,
turned off her cell.

294
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,502
Oh.

295
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,002
- I need yourunning point On swat.
- Okay, thanks.

296
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,603
Hillinger, keep trying
to reach renee.

297
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:40,602
We're running out of time.

298
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:42,103
Put more gas in!

299
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:43,700
If we do, it'll kill
them instantly.

300
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:50,800
How much time is it
going to take, jack?

301
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:53,501
It's up to them.

302
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:02,000
I can't breathe.

303
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:05,803
Just close your eyes,
let it happen.

304
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:11,203
I know if we open that
door, it will be worse.

305
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:18,901
I love you.

306
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,300
Alama, no!

307
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:38,403
Get him out of there!

308
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:40,100
Get the woman, too.

309
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,001
Just breathe, you'll
be all right.

310
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:51,602
- Just breathe.
- Okay, let's go!

311
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:55,903
I'm so sorry.

312
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:08,500
Let's go.

313
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,300
- It's moss.
- Larry, it's renee.

314
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,200
Renee, listen.

315
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,000
Bauer and almeida may
already be at matobo's.

316
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:36,302
Yeah, They are, i've got a visual on them
Loading matobo and his wife into a truck.

317
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:37,602
Where the hell is swat?

318
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:38,602
How long for swat?

319
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:40,902
They're still about five minutes
out. Renee, listen to me,

320
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:43,501
i want you To stand down and
fallback until they get there.

321
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:44,502
Do you hear me?

322
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:45,900
Let me just get a plate
on the vehicle.

323
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,003
Drop the gun.

324
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:50,803
Renee?

325
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:54,903
Renee?

326
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,303
Damn it!

327
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,003
Janis, try getting her back.

328
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:04,802
- Whose swat team will be first on scene?
- Remick's.

329
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:06,000
Get him for me, now.

330
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,100
Move!

331
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:12,603
Mr. Emerson!

332
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,100
Far as i can tell,
she's alone.

333
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:18,600
Damn you, bauer,
you son of a bitch.

334
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,402
She's fbi.
Her name is walker.

335
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:29,102
She's the one that pulled me Out of
the senate hearing to help me find tony.

336
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:30,603
Don't be stupid.

337
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:32,001
What are you talking about?

338
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,803
How much does tanner know
About your operation?

339
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:35,201
Enough to cause problems.

340
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,701
We need to find out from
her what he Told the fbi--

341
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,001
Till then We do nothing.

342
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,001
He's right, david.

343
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,102
We need to be sure nothing
else has been compromised.

344
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:45,500
Get her in the cage.

345
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:47,600
Don't you touch me.

346
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:51,703
Get your hands
off of me!

347
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:54,301
Shut up or i will
Shut you up.

348
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:01,302
She's clean.
let's go!

349
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:33,803
- Do you have matobo?
- Yeah.

350
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,701
And the wife,
but we ran Into a complication.

351
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:38,201
A complication?

352
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,903
Fbi knew about the operation.
Which means tanner talked.

353
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,003
- I don't like this.
- No, neither do i.

354
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,702
We got one of their agents
With us, her name's walker.

355
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,202
I need you to check With
your source at the bureau,

356
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,803
Find out how much she knows.

357
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:51,700
All right.

358
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:53,101
If your source doesn't
come up all right. With anything,

359
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:54,900
we'll interrogate her
when we get there.

360
00:18:58,307 --> 00:19:00,001
Can't believe i trusted you.

361
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:04,703
You lying son of a bitch.

362
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,001
This is important, man.

363
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:30,900
To him and me.

364
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,900
Thanks, appreciate it.

365
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,401
- Any luck?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:37,701
I'm sorry it took so long,

367
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,301
but I tracked down a friend who
does crypto for the private sector--

368
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,800
he says he should be able to
crack the files on the thumb-drive.

369
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:46,002
Provided the, uh, encryption
isn't military grade or better.

370
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,803
I doubt Roger would have had
access to anything like that.

371
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:52,402
He also said you'd have a lot easier job
if you just went to the NSA.

372
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,303
Not until we know how badly my wife's
administration's been compromised.

373
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:59,502
My friend said he'd meet us
at his apartment in 20 minutes.

374
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,100
Do you trust him?

375
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,803
Yes.

376
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:07,003
Samantha says the documents
will prove my son was murdered.

377
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,601
I'll make sure he understands
this can't go anywhere.

378
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:13,902
Thank you, Brian.

379
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,502
You don't know what
it's been like.

380
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:22,103
All this time, knowing in my bones
Roger didn't commit suicide,

381
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,901
and having people
just tolerate me,

382
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:28,200
tell me it was
my grief talking.

383
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:33,002
I'm going to find the people
who did this to my son, Brian.

384
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:36,300
And I am going
to make them pay.

385
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,403
Sir, if I ma..

386
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:39,600
What is it?

387
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,400
Shouldn't you at least tell
the President what you're doing?

388
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:48,601
I can't take this
to my wife...

389
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:51,302
until I can prove it.

390
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:58,401
You wanted to see me?

391
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,500
One thing I've learned:

392
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:04,503
presidents don't
make new friends.

393
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,502
That's why they lean
on their old ones.

394
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,503
I'll need your
support, Ethan.

395
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:18,503
I'm going to authorize the military
operation in Sangala as planned.

396
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:19,702
Madame President...

397
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,303
You don't need to list
the consequences, Ethan.

398
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:24,600
Any action I take in West Africa

399
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,400
will likely result
in a terrorist attack here,

400
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:32,702
but if I take no action, an entire neration
of Sangalans will be wiped out.

401
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:36,802
Your critics will point out <i>you took
an oath to protect the people of this country.</i>

402
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:41,901
And the way to do that is not
give in to blackmail and threats.

403
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:45,200
Ethan...

404
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:48,401
taking a stand
against the genocide in Sangala

405
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:53,002
has reestablished our leadership and our
moral authority in the eyes of the world.

406
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:57,103
I cannot and
I will not back down.

407
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:00,000
- Yes?
- Madame President,

408
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:02,903
Secretary of State Stevens
is here to see you. It's urgent.

409
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,701
Send him in.

410
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:07,401
What is it, Joe?

411
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:11,702
The FBI just reported that Prime Minister Matobo
and his wife were abducted from their residence.

412
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:13,003
What?!

413
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:14,603
Abducted by whom?

414
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:18,102
His bodyguards identified Jack Bauer and
Tony Almeida as two of the men involved,

415
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:21,801
which means Dubaku has
the CIP device and Matobo.

416
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:25,500
Where is the FBI on finding him?
Do they have any active leads?

417
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:28,903
Not yet, Madame President. They're just
beginning the search operation.

418
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:33,503
I think we need to talk about how
Matobo's abduction affects the invasion.

419
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:36,500
Matobo is the only man
with enough popular support

420
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,400
and strength to lead Sangala
after an invasion.

421
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:43,202
Without him, the country would collapse
in complete bloodshed and chaos.

422
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:46,501
Which means the best course of action
may be to meet Dubaku's demand 

423
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:48,803
and withdraw our forces.

424
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:53,301
The best course of action is to find
Matobo and the people who took him.

425
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,900
And make sure the FBI brings
in every relevant agency.

426
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:02,102
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:04,102
So... 

428
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:07,601
where do we stand with your decision
to go through with the invasion?

429
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:12,302
We still have 30 minutes
before Dubaku's deadline.

430
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:15,302
I want Matobo found by then.

431
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,502
I just sent you new
search coordinates.

432
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:20,300
Upload a grid to the ground teams, please.

433
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,800
I already did they're
adjusting their perimeter now.

434
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,902
All right, thanks.

435
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,201
- Listen, Erika.
- What?

436
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,502
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

437
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,802
You're worried about
your wife on a plane. It's cool.

438
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:34,802
She's on the ground now.

439
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:37,103
Her plane landed; she got lucky.

440
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:40,400
That's great news.
I'm glad she's okay.

441
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:43,102
Hey, Sean.

442
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:45,603
I can't stop thinking
about last night.

443
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:47,902
Yeah, me, too.

444
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:50,101
Excuse me.

445
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,600
Sean, I need you to babysit
the downloads on my computer.

446
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:56,201
They're coming in from the forensics
team at Matobo's residence.

447
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:00,301
Now, please.

448
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:02,303
Okay, sure.

449
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:11,802
Excuse me. Remick's team just finished a
sweep of the Matobo residence.

450
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:14,301
He's on line two
if you want to talk to him.

451
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:16,301
Janis, wait.

452
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:17,601
Did you findenee?

453
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:22,300
No, sir, but one of Matobo's bodyguards
saw her being taken by Bauer and Almeida.

454
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,101
Then she's alive.

455
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:26,003
She's with the Matobos.

456
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:27,700
We'll run a trace
on her cell.

457
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:29,101
Can't do that, sir.

458
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,200
We recovered Agent Walker's
phone and weapon on-site.

459
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:34,202
Forensics is still
sweeping the scene.

460
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:36,301
All right, I want to be the first to know
if they find something.

461
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,401
Yes, sir.

462
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:43,801
All right, um...

463
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:47,401
get Renee's picture and
description out to all agencies.

464
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,501
Put me in the queue for
a real-time update from Homeland.

465
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:51,402
Okay.

466
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:53,400
Janis.

467
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:56,302
I want everybody in this office 

468
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:59,503
to make finding her their top priority.
Is that understood?

469
00:24:59,606 --> 00:25:01,200
It is.

470
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:05,602
Are you going to be okay?

471
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:09,102
What are you talking about?

472
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:13,502
Just get to work.

473
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:38,001
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you, sir.

474
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,700
You have nothing
to apologize for.

475
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,401
How much are they
paying you, Jack?

476
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:54,602
I hope it's enough to live with yourself when
they kill innocent Americans with the CIP device.

477
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:56,203
Shut up.

478
00:25:57,107 --> 00:26:00,300
How many people will die
because of what you're doing?

479
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:03,502
- Emerson.
- You were right.

480
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:05,702
Agent Walker broke Tanner.

481
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:07,101
How much did Tanner spill?

482
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:10,503
Other than the details
of Matobo's abduction, nothing.

483
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:12,301
- You're sure?
- Positive.

484
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,802
Walker is extraneous.

485
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,901
Kill her before you get here.

486
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:18,003
Okay, we'll be with you soon.

487
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:18,903
Be quick about it.

488
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:22,300
Dubaku's anxious to get his
hands on the prime minister.

489
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:25,801
Nichols checked with
his source at the Bureau.

490
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:29,003
Walker doesn't know anything
that can compromise the operation.

491
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:31,200
You trust Nichols' source?

492
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,603
Nichols does.

493
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:34,503
That's good enough for me.

494
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,403
Litvak, change of plan.

495
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,402
- Take a right on Morrison Avenue.
- got it

496
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:41,600
What's on Morrison?

497
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,002
Abandoned construction site--
we'll dump her there.

498
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,001
Shouldn't we find out
for ourselves what she knows?

499
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:55,001
Nichols wants her out of the way???

500
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:20,803
I understand your
deployment's stretched thin,

501
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,502
but one of our own
agents is missing.

502
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:23,603
That's a priority, too.

503
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:26,601
Look, look, I don't care
where you find the men.

504
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:28,000
Just get them out
there looking.

505
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:32,702
I've never seen him like that.

506
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,400
He looks like his head's
going to explode.

507
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:36,603
Thank you.
Well, I'm not surprised.

508
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:40,202
- Meaning?
- Meaning it's fairly obvious he has feelings for Renee.

509
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:41,703
Why do you think that?

510
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:45,203
Instinct--
I just know.

511
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:49,700
Stay on task.

512
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:20,703
General Juma says the American carrier
troop still has nobegun to withdraw.

513
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:23,102
Well, they haven't launched
their invasion either.

514
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:25,602
I gave this president a deadline
and it's almost past.

515
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:28,103
Apparently, our demonstration
was not convincing enough.

516
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,900
This woman is more
stubborn than we expected.

517
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:33,301
Once she realizes we have
Matobo, she'll change her mind.

518
00:28:34,706 --> 00:28:35,700
And if she doesn't?

519
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,700
You have the CIP module.

520
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:43,201
Launch another attack.

521
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:47,502
Let's see how stubborn she is after
American civilians start dying.

522
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,903
- When will Matoboe here?
- Within an hour.

523
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:53,800
What caused the delay?

524
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:55,402
An FBI agent
got in the way.

525
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:58,500
I needed to make sure she hadn't
compromised our operation.

526
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,203
- And has she?
- No.

527
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:01,700
As soon as my men
get rid of her,

528
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:04,201
I'll pick up Matobo personally
and bring him to you.

529
00:29:21,307 --> 00:29:22,303
This friend of yours,

530
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:25,403
so you're sure he's going to have
everything he needs to access the files?

531
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:27,002
He said he didn't think
it'd be a problem.

532
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:29,003
Thank you, Brian.

533
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:31,001
For all your help,
and your loyalty.

534
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,302
You don't need
to thank me, sir.

535
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:33,301
Yes, I do.

536
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,400
You're risking a lot to do this,
especially after what happened this morning.

537
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:39,801
You can thank me after we confirm
the information is on that drive.

538
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:43,203
Said the key should be
under the mat.

539
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:48,100
There it is.

540
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:07,502
When will your friend be here?

541
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,401
He should be here any minute.

542
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:12,402
Would you mind turning on the air?

543
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:15,200
- It's really hot in here.
- Of course, sir.

544
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:28,103
It's Samantha and Roger.

545
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:32,202
This is Samantha's apartment, sir.

546
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:39,802
You.

547
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,103
I'm sorry, sir.

548
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:44,900
Why?

549
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:49,001
Roger was looking into things
he shouldn't have.

550
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:51,502
I tried to protect him, too,

551
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:53,802
but he wouldn't let me.

552
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:56,901
inherited your determination.

553
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:02,403
You killed my son.

554
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:09,400
You...

555
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,803
killed Roger.

556
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:22,003
It's Tetradyzine, sir.

557
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,703
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

558
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:33,900
Don't try to speak, the Tetradyzine
also paralyzes your vocal chords.

559
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:41,303
If it's any consolation, sir,

560
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:42,902
Roger died quickly.

561
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,003
And I'm going to make sure...

562
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,601
you do, too.

563
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,000
Situation here is in control.

564
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:15,303
- Are you tracking Ms. Roth?
- Yeah.

565
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:18,602
Time to get her back
to her apartment.

566
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:22,600
- Are you sure this is going to work?
- It'll work fine.

567
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,503
Mr. Taylor came to her apartment
to confront her about Roger.

568
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,103
Lost his temper, killed her.

569
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:28,603
Took his own life, okay?

570
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:30,000
All right.

571
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:31,901
I'll let you know
if there are any problems.

572
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,200
I really am sorry, sir.

573
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:54,201
If only you'd left
well enough alone.

574
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,602
- Ms. Roth.
- Agent Vossler.

575
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:06,801
Henry Taylor sent me.

576
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:10,502
Mr. Taylor's been looking into
the matter you discussed.

577
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:12,602
He believes you're
in imminent danger.

578
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,003
My God...

579
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:17,403
What am I supposed to do?

580
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:19,802
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

581
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,402
Escort you to a safe house.

582
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:24,103
- Now?
- My orders are to take you there immediately.

583
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,102
We can stop at
your apartment first,

584
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,902
so you can pack clothes,
essentials.

585
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,100
Uh, I just need
to call my office.

586
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:33,202
Not until we get you
locked down, ma'am.

587
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:37,503
Please.

588
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:41,103
Okay.

589
00:33:41,307 --> 00:33:42,300
???

590
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:00,700
So it looks like your friend
from the A.G. is still here.

591
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,400
- I know.
- What's going on?

592
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,501
He wants to me about what Renee
did to Tanner in the hospital.

593
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:07,301
What did Renee do to Tanner
at the hospital?

594
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:10,802
I don't know, but Howell is
claiming she tortured Tanner.

595
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:12,401
Renee?

596
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,501
I don't believe that.

597
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:15,502
Maybe you should.

598
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:18,203
Tanner wasn't talking...

599
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:19,400
and she kicked me
out of the room.

600
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:22,401
And then the next thing I know,
the alarm on his ventilator is going off.

601
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:24,401
And Renee had
the information she needed?

602
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:25,802
Mm-hmm.

603
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,802
If you weren't in the room,
you don't have a problem.

604
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:36,103
I do, actually-- she asked me
to stall his lawyers.

605
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:37,402
And you did?

606
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:39,700
- Yes.
- Come on, Gold.
What were you thinking?

607
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:41,602
She gave me a direct order--
what was I supposed to do?

608
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,203
Say no.

609
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:47,400
Do you realize if they prove that
Renee tortured him you're an accessory?

610
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,000
And Larry is not
gonna protect you.

611
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:50,103
I know.

612
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:54,401
Let's just hope the A.G. will have moved on
to something else when this is all over.

613
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,900
I'm getting back to work.

614
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:09,903
Agent Moss.

615
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,203
- What do you want?
- Forgive my interruption,

616
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:17,103
but it's just been brought to my
attention that Agent Walker is missing.

617
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:22,400
Yes, she may have been abducted
by the same people responsible

618
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:25,300
for kidnapping
Matobo and his wife.

619
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:28,303
I'm very sorry to hear that.

620
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:32,403
And want you to know that I appreciate the
enormous pressure that you and the Bureau are under.

621
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:33,403
Glad to hear it.

622
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,201
Nevertheless, the Attorney General
is still pressing for a full account

623
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:39,900
of Agent Walker's handling of the
Tanner interrogation, and at this moment,

624
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:42,903
Janis Gold is the only witness
available to me.

625
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,400
She's not available
to you, Howell.

626
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:46,603
I already told you,
she can't be spared right now.

627
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:48,803
- I only need a short
time with her.
- You can't have her.

628
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:50,900
Are you going to force me
to get the A.G. on the line?

629
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:53,703
You've got to be kidding me. You really
want to press this right now?!

630
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:56,103
We're in the middle of
an international crisis.

631
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,100
- I'm aware of that.
- And all you seem
interested in

632
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:00,801
is condemning the actions of
an agent who's in God-knows-what danger 

633
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:02,401
just so you can nail her to the wall.

634
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:06,300
If Agent Walker broke federal guidelines
and used illegal tactics to get information,

635
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,903
then, yes, she will
be prosecuted.

636
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:11,203
Then maybe you can let us get her back
first before you throw her to the wolves,

637
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:14,203
I mean, if that's okay with you.

638
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,702
- Yes?
- Larry?

639
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:21,203
NSA just relayed a call
they intercepted to us.

640
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:23,701
Renee was referenced.

641
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,002
Referenced how?

642
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:26,902
Janis?

643
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:30,001
I think you need to come
hear it yourself.

644
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:32,801
I'll be right there.
Excuse me.

645
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:34,200
We're not done here.

646
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:35,701
Agent Moss!

647
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:41,800
- Did you source it?
- Five minutes ago. It's legit.

648
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:43,100
Check it again.

649
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:45,101
I already did, twice.

650
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,602
Where's the intercept code?

651
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,501
Right there above
the decryption algorithm.

652
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:50,603
They routed it to us
on a priority channel.

653
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:52,300
Were we able to get
verbal confirmation?

654
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:53,901
It's not going to change
the content of the call, Janis.

655
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,702
I know, I just...

656
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:58,100
What's on the NSA intercept?

657
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,302
What? You said Renee
was referenced. What's on it?

658
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:02,402
It's only a fragment,
but she's referenced, yeah.

659
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,202
Enough to get a GPS fix?

660
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,701
The clip's not even 27???seconds long.

661
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,000
The best we can say
is that it's in the Metro area.

662
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,002
Play it.

663
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,203
- Emerson
- you were right,

664
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:16,403
Agent Walker broke Tanner.

665
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:18,002
How much did Tanner spill?

666
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:21,501
Other than the details of
Matobo's abduction, nothing.

667
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,603
- You're sure?
- Walker is extraneous.

668
00:37:24,905 --> 00:37:26,703
Kill her before you get here.

669
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,700
We'll be with you soon.
Be quick about it.

670
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:32,400
Dubaku's anxious to get his
hands on the Prime Minister.

671
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:39,903
When was this call made?

672
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:42,401
Ten minutes ago.

673
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,000
- Run a trace.
- I already did.

674
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:45,602
Run it again!

675
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:07,903
Jack.

676
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:15,402
The ditch.

677
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:18,902
Kill her.

678
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,003
Yeah.

679
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:25,200
Tony.

680
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:42,401
Step down.

681
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,803
Step down!

682
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,802
You could either walk
or I could drag you.

683
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,801
You're really going to kill me?

684
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:07,101
- I'm not going to beg
for my life, Jack.
- Good.

685
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,203
So everything that you
told me was a lie?

686
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:26,102
I'm doing what I have to.
I don't expect you to understand.

687
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:30,102
I understand that you are
a traitor and a murderer.

688
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:32,401
Turn around.

689
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:34,500
No.

690
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,800
You're going to have to look at me
when you pull that trigger.

691
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:40,003
I said turn around.

692
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:42,100
If you trust me, I will get you
through this alive.

693
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,303
Get on your knees.

694
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:32,702
For a second there, I didn't
thk you were going to do it.

695
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:34,701
Now bury her.

696
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:36,602
We're on a timetable.

697
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:38,503
Can't have anyone finding the body
before we're out of the country.

698
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,402
Give him a hand, Tony.

699
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:20,100
