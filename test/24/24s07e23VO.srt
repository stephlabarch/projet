00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,227
The Justice Department is

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,713
<i>investigating
the Jonas Hodges car bombing.</i>

5
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,776
I changed my mind.
I didn't transfer the funds.

6
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,678
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges
if he wasn't paid?

7
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:32,073
Because it's what you wanted,
am I right?

8
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:35,117
Jack, I unlocked
Tony's location data.

9
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,372
Okay, we've got him.

10
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,493
Where's the canister?

11
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:49,632
I am not gonna stop
until you tell me where it is.

12
00:00:58,503 --> 00:00:59,850
- Jack.
- It's all right.

13
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,048
- Give yourself a shot.
- I did 20 minutes ago.

14
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:03,270
It's not working.

15
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,759
You heading home?

16
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,275
Us, too.

17
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:13,531
- This is Bauer.
- I'm sending a link to your phone.

18
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,282
<i>Something I think you should see.</i>

19
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:18,160
<i>Your daughter's in the company
of our operatives.</i>

20
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,321
<i>Put this call on your earpiece,
keep the line open.</i>

21
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:22,507
<i>I'm gonna be listening
to everything you say.</i>

22
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:26,365
<i>You will help Tony Almeida escape
or my people will murder your daughter.</i>

23
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:35,598
Okay.

24
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:36,913
Thank you.

25
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:39,670
The Deputy Attorney General
is ready for you, ma'am.

26
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:47,423
TelePresence call is initiated.
Network is secure. Go ahead.

27
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,985
<i>Good morning. Thank you for giving up
your time for this investigation.</i>

28
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,153
Of course.

29
00:01:52,474 --> 00:01:55,868
<i>Mrs. Rollins and Mr. Hock
are from the Justice Department.</i>

30
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:57,970
<i>They'll be conducting
your interview.</i>

31
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:00,828
<i>Let the record show
that this is to be the testimony</i>

32
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,040
<i>of Olivia Taylor,
acting White House chief of staff</i>

33
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,376
<i>regarding the homicide
of federal witness Jonas Hodges.</i>

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,234
<i>Let it also show that I'm present</i>

35
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:12,646
<i>to ensure that strict protocols
be followed for Ms. Taylor's protection.</i>

36
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,175
Why would I need protecting?

37
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:17,694
<i>A poor choice of words.
I merely meant that</i>

38
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,139
<i>your questioning
is just a formality.</i>

39
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:23,177
<i>We have to go through everyone
who had knowledge of Hodges' whereabouts</i>

40
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:25,686
<i>- up until the time of the car bombing.</i>
- I see.

41
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,764
<i>Mrs. Rollins, you have the floor.</i>

42
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:28,989
<i>Let's begin.</i>

43
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:38,618
I wanted Olivia in this briefing.
Where is she?

44
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,201
I'm sorry, she's tied up

45
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,995
with the Deputy A.G. and investigators
looking into the Hodges murder.

46
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,874
Have they made any progress
on who leaked Hodges' location?

47
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:48,362
Not yet.
But they agree that the list of people

48
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:51,253
who knew Hodges was alive
and at FBI is short.

49
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:52,880
The leak had to come from inside.

50
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:58,219
Good morning, everyone.

51
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,055
- Morning, Madam President.
- Madam President.

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,389
Please take your seats.

53
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,343
I realize that we are all
in dire need of sleep.

54
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:09,768
But I felt that it was vital

55
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:13,234
to bring you all up to speed
on the events of the past few hours

56
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,500
and a greater crisis
we face on the horizon.

57
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:20,324
Less than 30 minutes ago,
the FBI managed

58
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,285
to recover the last canister
of the bioweapon.

59
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,580
But I'm afraid
that the danger is far from over.

60
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:28,387
Before his death,

61
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,575
Jonas Hodges told us

62
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:34,922
that there were other parties involved
in the creation of this bioweapon,

63
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,840
a highly secret
and extremely powerful group

64
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:39,885
of private military firms

65
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,738
collaborating to undermine
the government of this country.

66
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,307
Excuse me, Madam President.

67
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:47,932
But which military firms
are we talking about?

68
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,687
We don't know, Admiral.

69
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,022
Hodges gave us no names or idea

70
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,258
of which companies are involved.

71
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,484
But whoever they are,

72
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,284
they represent a very real
and ongoing threat.

73
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:05,236
Now, we don't have much
actionable intelligence at this point.

74
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:09,290
However, the FBI has apprehended
former CTU operative

75
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,459
Tony Almeida.
He is a key figure in this plot,

76
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:16,857
and someone we hope will be able
to help us uncover who these people are.

77
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,094
Agent Walker,
this is Air Support Bravo Three.

78
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,480
We're in position.
Your convoy is in sight.

79
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:25,655
Roger that.

80
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,222
Metro will control traffic

81
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:29,466
and set up a secure corridor
through the downtown area.

82
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,938
We'll be bringing Almeida into
headquarters through the west entrance.

83
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:35,324
<i>It's almost time, Mr. Bauer.</i>

84
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,694
<i>The convoy you're traveling with
is about to get off on the I-70.</i>

85
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,968
Break off before you reach
the downtown exit

86
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:44,241
or you'll lose your chance
to facilitate an escape for Tony.

87
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,339
For your daughter's sake,

88
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:49,943
you don't want that to happen.

89
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,625
<i>Now listen carefully.</i>

90
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,450
You'll need to commandeer the van

91
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:57,586
and peel onto the Taft Street exit
in about four miles.

92
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:01,091
I'll direct you further
once you've managed this.

93
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:02,493
Remember,

94
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,942
my operatives
are with your daughter.

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,280
In fact, I'm looking at her right now.
So don't try to be a hero.

96
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:26,265
Something wrong?

97
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,495
It just starts to look like the flight
is gonna be full, and I'm on standby.

98
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,955
No, you're gonna get on.

99
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,500
There have to be some people too spooked
to fly after those planes went down.

100
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:37,881
- Did you have to bring that up?
- I'm just saying.

101
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:41,018
Look, I think it makes us safer.
They're gonna take extra precautions.

102
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:43,592
Excuse me.
Are those yours?

103
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,055
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,591
Would you mind,
so my mother could sit down, please?

105
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,078
- Sure.
- Thanks.

106
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:00,234
- You're bleeding.
- What?

107
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,113
- You have a scratch on your neck.
- Honey.

108
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,491
That must have happened when the door
hit you getting out of the cab.

109
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:12,439
Well, I'll just go to the newsstand
and see if they have some Band-Aids.

110
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:39,771
- What is it?
- I'm getting worried.

111
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,869
It's only a matter of time before
that FBI agent's body is discovered.

112
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:45,195
And I think Bauer's daughter
is getting suspicious.

113
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:48,490
Look, I gave Bauer a short window
to deliver Tony to me.

114
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,557
Won't be long.
Just stand by until you hear from me.

115
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:53,370
What if Kim Bauer
makes us before then?

116
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,123
You can't allow yourselves
to be taken.

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,925
Do what you have to do.

118
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,038
Agent Walker,
let me see your comm unit.

119
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,652
I want to adjust this frequency.
It's interrupting mine. Thanks.

120
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,393
Don't move. Don't move!

121
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,620
Just keep driving
and no one gets hurt.

122
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:37,915
Both of you, I want you
to slowly draw your weapons,

123
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,042
put them on the floor
and slide them to me.

124
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,210
Do it!

125
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,962
Don't make this any harder
than it already is.

126
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,134
Give me your weapon
or I will kill him.

127
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,351
Come on, Jack,
you're not gonna kill anyone.

128
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,058
Give me your weapon! Now!

129
00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:03,649
Driver, I want you to handcuff yourself
to the steering wheel, over and under.

130
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,817
Do it now.

131
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,678
Exit the freeway when I tell you.
Until then, maintain speed.

132
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,918
Now!

133
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,762
Agent Walker, what's happening?
Agent Walker?

134
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:36,932
<i>Comm, the prisoner transport
has split from the convoy.</i>

135
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,976
Renee, it's Janis, do you read me?

136
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,287
<i>Are you reading me?</i>

137
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,164
<i>Agent Walker, what's your 20?</i>

138
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,084
<i>Agent Walker, please respond.</i>

139
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,572
- Jack, why?
- They've got my daughter.

140
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,100
That's not possible. I deployed Franks
to watch over her, like you asked.

141
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:57,225
He's dead.

142
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,915
The people working with Tony
have operatives with Kim right now.

143
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:02,211
They'll kill her
if I don't break him out.

144
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:03,912
- That's enough!
- Son of a bitch.

145
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,499
We're on Taft.
What now?

146
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:10,697
You'll see the Connecticut
Avenue Tunnel, take the north lane.

147
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:14,052
Continue down this street.
Go towards the tunnel, north.

148
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,054
Aerial Bravo three,
you still have a visual?

149
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:17,532
<i>Affirmative.</i>

150
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,224
The follow vehicles in the convoy

151
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,063
<i>are getting off at the next exit,
and will be doubling back.</i>

152
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:25,397
We've got prisoner transport on sat.
They're heading west on Hudson.

153
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
Wait.

154
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:29,605
They're pulling
into the Connecticut Avenue Tunnel.

155
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,321
I'm losing visual.
Repeat, I am losing visual.

156
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,081
Pull up the transponder locators.

157
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,394
Okay, we're in the tunnel.

158
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,105
<i>You'll see me parked in the emergency
lane about a quarter mile in.</i>

159
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:48,879
I want you to pull behind that SUV.

160
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:01,257
Jack, please. I understand your reasons,
but you can't do this.

161
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:04,061
No, what I can't do is risk Kim's life.
Uncuff Tony.

162
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:10,855
Give me the keys.

163
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,512
Cuff her. I'll take him.

164
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:22,822
They have a camera on Kim.
I don't trust Tony to let her go.

165
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:24,913
Please, I'm begging you,

166
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,417
do whatever you have to
to save her, please.

167
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,925
The gun.

168
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,639
Cuff yourself.

169
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:54,054
Come on.

170
00:10:58,295 --> 00:10:59,927
What are you bringing Bauer for?

171
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:03,453
Tony, I've done everything you've asked.
Just let Kim go.

172
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,721
- Let her go!
- Get in the car.

173
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,460
So what are you doing, Tony? We don't
need a hostage, specially not him.

174
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,880
- Shoot him and let's get out of here.
- You're not seeing the big picture.

175
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,336
Your people will be able
to launch the biological attacks,

176
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:18,427
- just as they originally planned.
- How?

177
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:21,096
We lost the canister.
We don't have the pathogen anymore.

178
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:22,931
We have Jack.

179
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:26,461
The pathogen's in his blood,
it's in his organs.

180
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,310
We'll be able to harvest
everything we need from his body.

181
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,025
Why do you think I had you
put those operatives on Kim Bauer?

182
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,833
Your people are still going to need
proof that Jack's viable.

183
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,467
Have one of your biochemists
meet us at the complex.

184
00:11:57,698 --> 00:12:00,171


185
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:04,378
Let's begin with the document
on the left-hand side of your packet.

186
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:06,099
Take a moment to look that over.

187
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,865
Thank you again for coming.

188
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,854
You can thank me, Agent Pierce,
by telling me what this is all about.

189
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,335
All right, sir,
but we don't have much time.

190
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,872
You implied it had
something to do with Olivia Taylor.

191
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:18,035
Yes, sir. A few hours ago,

192
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Jonas Hodges was killed
outside FBI headquarters.

193
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:22,699
My God.

194
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:26,725
Now, authorities believe he was murdered
to keep him from implicating others

195
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,550
who were involved
in the bioweapon attacks,

196
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:32,376
but I suspect
there may be another scenario.

197
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:36,338
And I have reason to believe
that Ms. Taylor might be involved.

198
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,530
That is an outrageous accusation,
Agent Pierce.

199
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,137
Olivia is capable of many things,

200
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,765
but I can't believe
committing murder is one of them.

201
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:48,645
Please, just hear me out.

202
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,521
After the President agreed
to a witness protection deal for Hodges,

203
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:57,067
Ms. Taylor made a comment to me
about wanting to see Hodges dead.

204
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,320
He was responsible for her brother's
death. She was venting.

205
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,705
I thought so, too.

206
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,044
Until she met in her office
with an old colleague of hers,

207
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:06,576
a man named Martin Collier.

208
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:09,956
- I know Collier.
- Then you know the sort of man he is.

209
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,081
I do.

210
00:13:11,363 --> 00:13:13,708
But none of this constitutes
proof of complicity.

211
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,129
No, sir. That's why I need you to access
the digital recording system.

212
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,099
To see if their conversation
was recorded.

213
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,678
Agent, you're asking me to break
into an office that's no longer mine.

214
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,850
And access classified recordings
of the acting chief of staff.

215
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,232
Mr. Kanin,

216
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:32,700
if my suspicions prove correct,

217
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:36,565
you of all people understand how grave
these consequences would be.

218
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,183
Sir, Ms. Taylor's behavior over the past
several hours has been erratic at best.

219
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:45,365
She's with the Justice investigators
now. We don't have much time.

220
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:51,074
Sir, I need you to decide
if you're going to help me.

221
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,554
<i>If you could just again</i>

222
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>review the records on the screen below,
Ms. Taylor. I want to confirm</i>

223
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,077
<i>that during the timeline in question,
you had no outside contact</i>

224
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,912
<i>other than what's reflected in the phone
and internet logs you uploaded to us.</i>

225
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:37,209
For the third time, that's correct.

226
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,002
<i>We're just trying to be thorough.</i>

227
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:42,530
I think we've taken up enough
of your valuable time, Ms. Taylor.

228
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:45,555
- Thank you for indulging us.
- You're welcome.

229
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,428
Good luck with the rest
of the investigation.

230
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,115
Sir. She's on her way.

231
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,502
Ms. Taylor.

232
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:24,153
I tried to get word to you, but was told
you were not to be disturbed.

233
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,590
Word to me about what?

234
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,108
- Let me explain.
- Morning, Olivia.

235
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:34,207
What are you doing here?

236
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,519
I'd forgotten some files
when I cleared out my office, so...

237
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:40,855
Secret Service was kind enough
to admit me so I could retrieve them.

238
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,525
May I see them?

239
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,488
Nothing terribly important.

240
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,356
But I like to fully archive
my memos for...

241
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,584
posterity, you understand.

242
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:01,626
So you have what you came for.

243
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:05,182
- I think so.
- Well,

244
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:07,173
then if you'll excuse me.

245
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,169
Of course.

246
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,409
Agent Pierce,

247
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,291
stay a moment, please.

248
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,721
- What was he doing here?
- Ma'am?

249
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,452
Kanin. Did you observe him
while he was in my office?

250
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,495
Is something wrong, ma'am?

251
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:40,254
Yes, something is wrong!

252
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,279
No one, and I mean no one,
is to be allowed in my office without...

253
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:01,269
Could I get someone on staff
to help you with that?

254
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:28,213
- Ms. Taylor...
- Security,

255
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,256
this is Olivia Taylor.

256
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,102
Ethan Kanin is on his way
out of the White House,

257
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,844
I want him taken into custody.

258
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,091
Detain him until I arrive.

259
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,766
Ma'am, what's happened?

260
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:43,348
He stole my property, Aaron.

261
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:55,152
Mr. Kanin.

262
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,661
- Yes?
- We have orders to detain you, sir.

263
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:03,331
- Orders from whom?
- From the acting chief of staff, sir.

264
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:07,133
Please come with us.

265
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,436
Command, this is Walker.
Janice, do you read me?

266
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,477
- I'm here. Are you all right?
<i>- Yes.</i>

267
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:26,771
What is happening?

268
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,066
Jack commandeered the transport.
He was forced into helping Tony escape.

269
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,110
Renee, it's Chloe.
What do you mean forced?

270
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,533
The group Almeida's working for
threatened to kill Kim

271
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,126
if he didn't cooperate.

272
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,146
- They have Kim?
- According to Jack,

273
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:40,947
they have operatives with her now
but I don't think she's aware of that.

274
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:42,704
Do you want me
to contact airport PD?

275
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,853
We can't move on them
until we know who they are.

276
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:47,482
Chloe, I need you to patch me in
directly to Kim's departure gate.

277
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,707
- She's at Gate 7.
- I'm on it.

278
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,796
I'll let the White House know
what's happened.

279
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,256
Okay, I'll call you back.

280
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:55,522
I have a priority one
emergency call from FBI.

281
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:57,427
Please connect me
with an agent at Gate 7.

282
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:01,496
<i>Attention, passengers for Flight 147,
nonstop to Los Angeles.</i>

283
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,391
<i>Maintenance crews have finished
preparing the aircraft,</i>

284
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:07,840
<i>and we should be ready to begin boarding
in approximately ten minutes.</i>

285
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:09,647
<i>Thank you again for your patience.</i>

286
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,566
The following standby ticket holders

287
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,744
please report
to the ticket agent counter:

288
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:17,184
<i>Marissa Boily, Kim Bauer,
Robert Leighton.</i>

289
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:21,868
- Looks like I got on the flight.
- Told you you would.

290
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:39,026
- I'll take you over here.
- Okay.

291
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:42,081
A phone call for you.

292
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,268
This is Renee Walker. Listen carefully.
Try not to react and do not look around.

293
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,807
You're in danger. You're being watched
by operatives sent by Tony Almeida.

294
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,148
Tony? I don't understand.

295
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,150
He's involved in the attacks.
We had him in custody,

296
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,904
but he used you as leverage
to force your father to break him out.

297
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,407
I don't believe he would do
something like that.

298
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,690
He's on the run.
He's taken your father hostage.

299
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:05,203
You've got to trust me on this.

300
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:08,915
I'm on my way to you now, but we have
to ID the people who are watching you.

301
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:11,536
They're our only lead
to finding your father and Tony.

302
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:14,702
There was a man staring at me earlier,
but I haven't seen him in a while.

303
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:16,506
- Describe him.
- He was Hispanic,

304
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:19,753
medium build, he had short brown hair,
he was wearing a suit.

305
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,010
That was Agent Franks.

306
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,179
Your father had me deploy him
to be sure you got on the plane safely.

307
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,641
<i>He was killed by the people
following you. Listen,</i>

308
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,269
whoever these operatives are,
they're in close proximity to you.

309
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,981
<i>They sent your father a live feed
to prove they had you in their sights.</i>

310
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:36,025
Have you noticed anyone
with a camera or cell phone?

311
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,319
- Or a laptop.
<i>- What?</i>

312
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,903
There's a couple I've been talking to,
they're sitting next to me.

313
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:44,598
The man has an open laptop
right in front of me.

314
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,828
- Can you give me a description?
- He's got long hair.

315
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,097
He's tall...

316
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:54,127
- Well I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Kim, what's wrong?

317
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:57,504
Please let baggage claim know
that I'll be more careful next time.

318
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,870
- Chloe, do you read me?
- I'm here.

319
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,511
<i>The operatives may be moving on Kim.
Alert airport police,</i>

320
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:08,105
have them lock down the terminal.
Tell security to maintain patrols.

321
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,986
Do nothing to arouse suspicion.

322
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:12,006
Okay, bye.

323
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:14,856
We saw you on the phone.
We thought there might be a problem.

324
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,529
- Need help?
- There's no problem.

325
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:18,536
I left my electric toothbrush
on in my luggage.

326
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,680
The airline called
and said that they broke my lock.

327
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:23,809
- Nice. Did you get your boarding pass?
- Yeah. It's right here.

328
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:32,624
There was a little security problem

329
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,375
- with her luggage.
- I guess they can never be too careful.

330
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,934
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

331
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,636
This is the first time that I've been
apart from my little girl.

332
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:56,648
And I'm just a little anxious
to get back to see her.

333
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,564
Would you like to see
a picture of her?

334
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:02,775
Sure.

335
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:05,073
I've got one in here.

336
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,451
Here it is.

337
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,400
Where is...

338
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:14,373
Her name's Teri.

339
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,186
She's adorable.

340
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:17,805
Thank you.

341
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:20,129
She looks really so cute.

342
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:24,676
That's my husband actually.

343
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:27,575
This is...

344
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:35,355
Take her.

345
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,574
- Code two!
- Suspects are armed!

346
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,287
Get down.

347
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,948
It's Kim Bauer. Security's down.
Where are the airport police?

348
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:41,961
They're mobilizing.
What about the operatives?

349
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,167
The woman is dead.
The man is getting away.

350
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,824
We need him to find your father.
What direction is he headed?

351
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,099
Agent Walker?

352
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:51,345
Damn it!

353
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,324


354
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:26,305
I always liked that
about you, Ethan.

355
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,300
Even when I was a little girl,
you stood up when I came into the room.

356
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,309
Old habits die hard.

357
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,734
You removed
something from my office.

358
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:37,433
- I want it back.
- I told you, you're welcome to them.

359
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,811
You know damn well
I'm not talking about those files.

360
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,771
Do I?

361
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,732
Ethan, I found the digital recorder.

362
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:47,003
Now give me what you took,

363
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:50,530
or I'll order the security officers
outside this door to strip search you.

364
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:55,992
All right, I do have a recording.

365
00:24:57,116 --> 00:25:00,711
It's a personal account of my last days
in service to this administration

366
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:02,708
and I think I'm entitled to it.

367
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,170
No one is entitled to take sensitive
material out of the White House.

368
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:11,843
Now it's national security
you're worried about?

369
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:15,131
As a matter of fact, yes.

370
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:18,849
Well, I still have my clearances.

371
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,810
Why don't we listen together.

372
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,272
You are in no position
to dictate terms, Ethan.

373
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,211
You're in violation
of at least ten federal laws.

374
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:29,110
What are you so afraid of, Olivia?

375
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:32,195
What's on there
that's so incriminating?

376
00:25:33,642 --> 00:25:35,992
I'm not the one
facing incrimination.

377
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:37,618
You are.

378
00:25:38,724 --> 00:25:40,538
But give me the recording right now

379
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,789
and I'll see to it
that no charges are filed.

380
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:48,611
Last chance, Ethan.

381
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:00,229
Search him for a data card.

382
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:03,560
I'm being held without cause.
I demand to speak to President Taylor.

383
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,314
It was the president
who ordered his detention.

384
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:09,442
If that's true,
I want to hear it from her directly.

385
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:12,924
Well, this is a criminal matter now.

386
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:16,544
Considering her personal relationship
with Mr. Kanin,

387
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,597
the president
doesn't deem it appropriate

388
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:20,620
to intrude on the investigation.

389
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:24,459
Please stand up, Mr. Kanin.

390
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Arms up.

391
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,712
You're making a terrible mistake.

392
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,958
Ms. Taylor is grossly
overstepping her authority.

393
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:42,801
Thank you, Agent.

394
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,207
Process him out.

395
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:45,758
Come with me, Mr. Kanin.

396
00:26:56,972 --> 00:27:00,158
I don't think you understand
the seriousness of what you're doing.

397
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:03,961
I don't think you do.

398
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:36,777
Agent Hobson,

399
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,652
I can take him the rest of the way.

400
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:42,168
Fine.

401
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:48,059
She's definitely hiding something,
Agent Pierce.

402
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:50,884
Lucky for us
I'm a paranoid son of a bitch.

403
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,638
May I ask
what was on the other data card?

404
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,656
Nothing.

405
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:04,831
It's blank.

406
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:07,727
I can try to get you
into the communications office

407
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,729
- so you can listen to that.
- Too risky, and unnecessary.

408
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:14,216
I have a companion device
to the recorder in my car.

409
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,280
It sounds like you were...

410
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:18,953
expecting this.

411
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:23,247
One has to be prepared
when you're dealing with Olivia.

412
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:25,394
I'll let you know what I find.

413
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,519
What are you doing?

414
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,181
What are you doing?

415
00:29:28,242 --> 00:29:31,436
We're gonna use you
to reconstitute the bioweapon, Jack.

416
00:29:35,988 --> 00:29:37,942
Put him on the table face-down.

417
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,289
- How long till we know?
- It depends.

418
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,149
On what?

419
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:46,779
On the levels of pathogen
in his spinal fluid.

420
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:48,119
Give me a time frame.

421
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,930
15 minutes.

422
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:52,383
Good. Get started.

423
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,725
Don't!

424
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,585
Give him something
to control the seizure.

425
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,256
I need him completely immobilized.

426
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,033
I'll contact the group
as soon as we know if Bauer's viable.

427
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,195
- I need to talk to you first.
- What is it?

428
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:25,904
I want a larger role
in the organization.

429
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,987
I think this is a good time
to make my case.

430
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:31,871
We've gone over this before, okay?
It's not how it works. You don't ask in.

431
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:34,540
- You're invited in.
- Then get me an invitation.

432
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:38,252
After what I've done today,
I think I've earned it.

433
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:41,950
You have been resourceful,
that's true.

434
00:30:43,222 --> 00:30:44,672
- Still...
- Look,

435
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,469
I know you talk to the top guy.

436
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:49,234
All I'm asking is that you get us
in the same room together.

437
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,778
- I'll sell myself.
- That wouldn't be the right approach.

438
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:54,059
- Why not?
- Because he's careful to a fault.

439
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:57,013
And he's very protective
of his anonymity.

440
00:30:57,827 --> 00:30:59,190
I can appreciate that.

441
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:02,610
But the bottom line is, without me,
this operation never happens.

442
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:06,923
Now you have influence over him.

443
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:09,325
He trusts you.

444
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,411
You can convince him.
I've seen you do it before.

445
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:16,412
- This is different.
- That's right.

446
00:31:16,995 --> 00:31:18,295
It is different.

447
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:20,216
This time it's for me.

448
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,303
I'm ready to extract
the spinal fluid.

449
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:31,918
- Hold his head still.
- All right.

450
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:49,281


451
00:31:55,536 --> 00:31:58,583
- He knows, Martin, I'm telling you.
- No, Olivia, he doesn't.

452
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,219
Worst case, he has a suspicion.

453
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:03,610
I mean he never actually had the time
to listen to the recording, did he?

454
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,424
Okay, and he never will, because
you destroyed the data card, right?

455
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,797
- Of course.
- Then we're fine, all right?

456
00:32:09,922 --> 00:32:12,721
So long as you keep thinking clearly
and don't panic.

457
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:16,096
You're forgetting
I ended this man's career, Martin.

458
00:32:16,221 --> 00:32:18,060
He won't let me off the hook, ever.

459
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,026
You're the president's daughter,
okay?

460
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:22,782
Trust me, no one will come after you
without hard evidence.

461
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,525
Least of all Ethan Kanin.

462
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,083
I've got to go.

463
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,121
The president's been looking for you.
She needs you.

464
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:32,264
What's going on?

465
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:34,846
There's a situation unfolding
at the airport involving Almeida.

466
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:37,265
We're about to be briefed,
and she wants you in on it.

467
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:40,896
Everything all right?

468
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:42,433
Yes, fine.

469
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:53,808
Need help over here.

470
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,212
- Did you see which way he went?
- It was chaos.

471
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:02,249
There were people
running everywhere.

472
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,899
It's Renee.

473
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,490
- Go ahead.
- The male operative remains at large.

474
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:10,485
Kim Bauer is missing. Either
she went after him, or she's a hostage.

475
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,531
Issue a priority alert
across all channels.

476
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,690
Officer, my name is Kim Bauer.

477
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:29,945
I'm following the man
who shot up the terminal.

478
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,112
You need to contact
Special Agent Renee Walker with the FBI.

479
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:53,479
Kim, go ahead.

480
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:55,426
<i>I've got him.
He's in the South Parking.</i>

481
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,845
- Are you in visual contact?
- He's on an upper levels

482
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,431
- I'm at the exit.
- Copy that. We're coming towards you.

483
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:01,696
Hurry!

484
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:21,785
Hang on! Help is on the way.

485
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:21,099
Here.

486
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:23,648
- You're hurt. Let me see your arm.
- No, listen to me.

487
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,391
That laptop has the camera
they were using to track me.

488
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,855
With a D-11 inverse router,

489
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,308
we may be able to back trace the signal
to the people that have my father.

490
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:33,816
I worked at CTU, systems analyst.

491
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,216
Is there anyone at your office
that can help us with this?

492
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:37,861
I've got Chloe O'Brian standing by.

493
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,434
Get her on the phone.

494
00:36:46,324 --> 00:36:48,497


495
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,342
<i>Once this happens, once it goes through,
you can never go back.</i>

496
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,379
<i>You will live with it
for the rest of your life.</i>

497
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:43,691
<i>I don't need a lecture on conscience
from you of all people.</i>

498
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:46,531
<i>I have thought this through.</i>

499
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:50,799
<i>What I can't live with
is that monster getting away with this.</i>

500
00:37:51,256 --> 00:37:53,069
<i>He has to pay for what he did.</i>

501
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,143
The virus load is even higher
than we hoped for.

502
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:03,318
Ten-plus in spinal fluid alone.

503
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:06,033
Not enough to reconstitute the pathogen,
of course.

504
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,107
We'll still need his organs
for that.

505
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:10,713
He doesn't look too good.

506
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:13,652
How much longer does he have?

507
00:38:15,188 --> 00:38:17,127
A couple of hours, give or take.

508
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,801
And what happens if he dies
before we extract the pathogen?

509
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,095
Obviously,
it's optimal to keep the host alive,

510
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,696
but the pathogen could survive
up to 2 hours after death,

511
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:31,139
sometimes even longer.

512
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:34,554
In fact, the only sure way to destroy it
is by exposure to extreme temperatures

513
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,479
above 500-degrees Celsius.

514
00:38:38,746 --> 00:38:41,070
- Make sure you put that in your report.
- I have,

515
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,070
I've already uploaded it
to your computer.

516
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:45,001
Good.

517
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,619
Get him ready to move.

518
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:48,949
Get the stretcher.

519
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,240
Bauer is viable,

520
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:55,082
- but you'll need to secure a facility.
- <i>That won't be a problem</i>

521
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,752
as long as you're absolutely certain
that we can accomplish this.

522
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,224
We've already done the hard part,
Alan.

523
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,966
From what I understand, with the proper
equipment, the actual extraction

524
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,581
<i>and bioengineering
is fairly straightforward.</i>

525
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,850
Okay, Cara,

526
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:10,555
I'll contact the others.
Good work.

527
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,517
They should know
they have Almeida to thank for this.

528
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,448
He's the one who realized
Bauer was a possible source.

529
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:17,729
Relay my gratitude.

530
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,719
I think you should consider
going farther than that.

531
00:39:21,162 --> 00:39:22,693
Farther?
What did you have in mind?

532
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,614
Tony believes in what we're doing.

533
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:29,825
He wants to play a larger role.

534
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:34,204
- That sounds premature to me.
- The thing is, Alan,

535
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,197
if we don't make
a significant gesture,

536
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,450
I'm afraid we may lose him.

537
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:41,503
I don't even know this man, Cara.

538
00:39:42,828 --> 00:39:44,631
Then you should get to know him.

539
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:48,116
Are you suggesting I meet with him?

540
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,755
Look, all I'm saying

541
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,306
is that he would be
a very useful voice in the mix.

542
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:55,734
His field experience fills
a knowledge gap,

543
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,145
in regards to our logistics
and planning.

544
00:39:58,581 --> 00:40:00,998
Coming from you,
that's a hell of a recommendation.

545
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:02,852
There's no one better, Alan.

546
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:05,944
And it's not as if you haven't vetted
every other member of the group.

547
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,420
Maybe it is time that he and I met.

548
00:40:10,548 --> 00:40:12,548
I could be there where you are

549
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,040
in the next half hour.

550
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,948
You're coming here?

551
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:22,113
I think it would be a good idea
if I supervised Bauer's transfer myself,

552
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:24,507
make the others feel at ease,
don't you think?

553
00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:27,149
But, Cara,
I'll look Almeida in the eye,

554
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,760
and if, for any reason,

555
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,585
I don't like what I see,

556
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,151
you understand.

557
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:35,223
I can't let him
walk out of that meeting alive.

558
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:39,246
I understand.

559
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:47,527
He wants to meet you.

560
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:50,145
He'll be here in little while.

561
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:53,466
Thank you.

562
00:40:58,026 --> 00:40:59,456
It's up to you now.

563
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:09,854
Wheel the gurney closer.

564
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,344
He's too weak
to have gotten very far.

565
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:44,489
Cover the north exit.
I'll go this way.
