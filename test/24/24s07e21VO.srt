1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,466
Previously on 24

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,820
Have you secured the canister?

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,074
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

4
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:17,824
Our suspect escaped
beyond the perimeter.

5
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:19,629
I was told that the
area was locked down.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,400
- What happened? - He had help

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,030
From Tony Almeida.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,030
Almeida?

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,170
He was working for us.

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:26,320
It only appeared that way.

11
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,165
Apparently he was
pursuing his own agenda,

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,887
Trying to get his
hands on the canister.

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,563
We're all regrouping
to develop leads.

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,910
I may have one.

15
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,852
As hodges was taken into custody,
He yelled at me about some larger group

16
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,652
That would continue
on after his arrest.

17
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:41,312
If that's the case, Madam President,
We need to talk to him.

18
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,693
I need you to call
the attorney general

19
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,693
And draft a witness protection
agreement for Jonas Hodges.

20
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:48,391
There's no other
way he'll talk.

21
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:53,103
This man murdered your son, not to
mention Hundreds of innocent civilians.

22
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:56,372
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

23
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:59,143
Other than kill
Jonas Hodges, no.

24
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,340
I didn't mean that.

25
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:02,441
You know, you're right.

26
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:04,701
We shouldn't be talking
about this over the phone.

27
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:06,033
How soon can you be
at the White House?

28
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:08,281
- How's 15 minutes sound?
- Good.

29
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:13,051
The plan was to launch simultaneous
attacks early next year in many cities,

30
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:16,151
So the public would finally see that
the government can't protect them.

31
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:18,221
They'd demand drastic measures,
and we'd step in.

32
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:20,882
We were going to supply the enemies
that want to destroy this country.

33
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,193
Muhammed this, Achmed that.

34
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:26,202
Mr. Hodges, I need the names of the
people that you are working with.

35
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:27,931
- I don't have them.
- I want the names.

36
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:29,230
I don't know any!

37
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:32,701
Another attack today is all we need To
push this thing right over the edge.

38
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:35,100
This is no time to pull back.

39
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:36,470
I say we take that canister

40
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,911
- And finish the job off today.
- I'll contact the group.

41
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:44,083
The attack will be attributed to
this man-- Jibraan Al-zarian.

42
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:47,323
We're talking about launching a
new operation In the next few hours

43
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,221
And with only one canister.

44
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:51,351
The plan for this operation
was already in place.

45
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:53,422
We'd just be accelerating
the timetable.

46
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:56,663
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,
And the group is well rid of him,

47
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:59,061
But, in his lunacy,
he did us a favor.

48
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,161
I say we take it.

49
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:01,771
Hamid!

50
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:04,022
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

51
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:05,471
- You understand?! - Yes!

52
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:10,642
The following takes place between 4 a.m.
and 5 a.m.

53
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:41,093
How much more time do you need?

54
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:44,133
The material's almost
finished downloading.

55
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,811
Financial records are in place.

56
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm gonna need about another 15
minutes to alter the time stamps.

57
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:53,920
Good.

58
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,612
I'm gonna take this off.

59
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:10,873
You yell for help,
you and your brother die.

60
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,043
Understand?

61
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,320
Who are you people?

62
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:29,890
You're putting Jihadi
propaganda on my computer.

63
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,130
These weapons-- you're...

64
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:34,200
You're trying to make me
look like a terrorist.

65
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,800
Why are you doing this?

66
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:40,103
Listen to me, jibraan.

67
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:43,512
There's only one thing
you need to know.

68
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:46,683
If you don't do
exactly as I say,

69
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:51,482
You're going to watch your younger
brother die right in front of your eyes.

70
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,220
And then... I'm gonna kill you.

71
00:03:57,956 --> 00:04:02,020
However... if you cooperate...

72
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:05,690
...there's a good chance the two
of you will live through this.

73
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:10,503
What do you want me to do?

74
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:12,341
First off...

75
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:15,470
You're going to read this
statement in front of a camera,

76
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:18,241
And you're going to read
it like you mean it.

77
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,241
No, this is insane.

78
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,243
I can't read this.

79
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,580
I'm not going to do this.

80
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:24,753
Okay, see, that sounds to me like
you think you have a choice.

81
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,123
Please, this is not right.

82
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:27,350
You can't do this to us.

83
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,422
Okay, fine.

84
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:31,523
Okay, okay, please,
please don't hurt him.

85
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:37,062
I'll do whatever you say.

86
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:40,960
Okay?

87
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,050
I'll give you five
minutes to look that over.

88
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,113
I just finished the first
sweep with the CTU servers.

89
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,481
There's been no chatter,
no activity at all.

90
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:11,062
You updated the watch list?

91
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:14,361
Yes, everyone on that list Is already
under surveillance by law enforcement.

92
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:16,953
If one of them was gonna do something,
We would know about it.

93
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,560
Damn, well, we're going to
have to widen our parameter.

94
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:19,843
To include what?

95
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,310
I want you to check out every
muslim in the Washington D.C. area.

96
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,901
Target anyone who's working in
a sensitive government position

97
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,730
Or in a place that
might get hit.

98
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,551
Then I want you to
start pulling the files

99
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:33,682
On every political activist
working in the muslim community.

100
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,283
Also, I want you
to contact INS.

101
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:38,020
I want a list of every recent
immigrant from an islamic country.

102
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,151
Excuse me,
has anybody heard of racial profiling?

103
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,260
Janis, not now.

104
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,361
No, she's right.

105
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:51,302
You're right,
this is racial profiling,

106
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:54,401
And I don't like it any more than you
do, But Hodges told me specifically

107
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:56,533
That he was going to
utilize muslim extremists

108
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,650
In an effort to offload
the blame for this attack.

109
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,673
I need to know who he's working with,
And we're running out of time.

110
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:03,552
I don't know a better
way of doing this.

111
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:08,053
So if you do,
please tell me now.

112
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:09,723
No.

113
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,993
Okay, thank you.

114
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:20,030
Chloe, I need you to
run down the list of...

115
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:27,971
I-I'm sorry,
I forgot what I was saying.

116
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,273
INS records, jack?

117
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:32,811
Yeah, run those down first
and then work backwards.

118
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,982
Excuse me.

119
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:38,551
This is the second
time he's done this.

120
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:40,271
He keeps forgetting things,
he looks like hell.

121
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:42,150
He's doing pretty
well, considering.

122
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:43,450
Considering?

123
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:44,651
Considering what?

124
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:46,490
He didn't tell you?

125
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,262
Tell me what?

126
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:51,230
If there's something wrong with jack,
Tell me now.

127
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:52,503
He's sick, Chloe.

128
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:54,231
He was infected with
the prion variant.

129
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:56,500
How?

130
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:59,660
He was trying to recover the bioweapon
canisters And one of them ruptured.

131
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,071
He was exposed.

132
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:02,300
Oh, my god.

133
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,730
I'm sorry, Chloe,
he probably didn't want you to worry.

134
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,103
Chloe...

135
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,933
Why didn't you tell
me you were sick?

136
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:26,831
It doesn't matter.

137
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:28,600
It doesn't matter?

138
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:29,672
I'm your friend.

139
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:31,903
We need to stay focused
on finding Tony.

140
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,643
Jack, you should be
in the hospital.

141
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:40,613
There's no treatment for this.

142
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:43,042
There's no cure.

143
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:47,820
So you're telling
me you're dying?

144
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:51,395
Yes.

145
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,727
How long?

146
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,663
A day, maybe two.

147
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:17,112
I've been taking this anti-seizure
medicine to keep me on my feet.

148
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:19,680
It's been working so far.

149
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,693
Oh, my god.

150
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,250
I'm so sorry.

151
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,632
Chloe, it's all right.

152
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:33,291
I've accepted it...

153
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,600
and I need you to
accept it, too.

154
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,511
Whatever time I've got left,
I want it to matter.

155
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:50,253
We need to find Tony,
put an end to this.

156
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,281
Chloe.

157
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:01,762
I can't do this without you.

158
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,961
Please, I need you
to go back to work.

159
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:14,740
Okay.

160
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,383
We strike this blow for
our brothers and sisters

161
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:31,222
Who have died at the hands
of this corrupt nation.

162
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:35,022
The hour is here, And we are
ready for the war that is to come.

163
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:41,932
Our fighters will not rest Until
America lies crippled and dying,

164
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:46,590
Her streets running with blood,
And her people begging for mercy,

165
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:48,940
But there will be none...

166
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,013
Only our vengeance.

167
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:51,440
We have a problem.

168
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:52,442
What is it?

169
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:54,613
Police.

170
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:03,292
Why don't you close down the
computer and get out of sight.

171
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,491
Take everything down
and watch the brother.

172
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:12,392
You need to come with me.

173
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:13,533
What is happening?

174
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,860
There are two police
officers outside.

175
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,201
I want you to find
out what they want

176
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,441
And convince them that
everything's okay in here.

177
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:25,771
Jibraan... don't
try to warn them.

178
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:28,143
Right.

179
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:35,853
Open the door, please.

180
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,253
Yes?

181
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,762
"Jibrain" Al-zarian?

182
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:47,433
Jibraan al-zarian.

183
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,411
Uh, we got a call from
one of your neighbors.

184
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,750
They said they heard some yelling
coming from your apartment?

185
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,953
Saw some people they didn't
recognize enter the premises,

186
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,170
Thought there might
be some trouble.

187
00:10:58,177 --> 00:10:59,201
No, everything is fine.

188
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:01,771
Those were friends of mine.

189
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,810
And what about the yelling?

190
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,041
We got into an argument.

191
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,911
They were drinking
a little too much.

192
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,151
Uh, it was nothing.

193
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:13,181
Where are your
friends now, sir?

194
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:18,221
You know, they got too loud,
so I asked them to leave.

195
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:20,862
They won't be back.

196
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,093
I'm very sorry for the noise.

197
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,233
Uh... it won't happen again.

198
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:26,900
I-I promise.

199
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,072
Okay. Just keep it
down from now on.

200
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:32,032
- I will. - Have a good night.

201
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,243
You, too.

202
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,263
All right, we're clear.

203
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:56,893
You did good, Jibraan.

204
00:11:57,065 --> 00:12:00,362
We have to finish reading this
statement before we take off.

205
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:01,562
Where are we going?

206
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:04,600
Don't worry about that.

207
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:08,043
You just keep doing as we say,
And you and your brother

208
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:10,141
Are gonna make it through this,
all right?

209
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:12,311
Set him up.

210
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:28,620
And there will be none,
only our vengeance.

211
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,931
And this is only the beginning.

212
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:37,170
We will strike again and again in the
name Of all that is great and righteous.

213
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:54,331
I think I've got something.

214
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:55,901
Agent walker? What is it?

215
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,381
One of the filters flagged
this a few minutes ago.

216
00:12:58,485 --> 00:12:59,393
I just finished vetting it.

217
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:03,273
These are multiple deposits
over a period of six months.

218
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:05,410
From an overseas Muslim
relief organization

219
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,413
Called the Islamic
League For World Peace.

220
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,550
A total of two million dollars To
the Washington Continental Bank.

221
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,662
Every penny of it was
withdrawn within 30 minutes.

222
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:16,550
What name's on the account?

223
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:17,512
Jibraan Al-Zarian.

224
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:21,560
He's 27 years old, moved here From
Pakistan on student visa four years ago.

225
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:24,531
This is his personal
web account.

226
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,071
These are some of the sites
he's been looking at recently.

227
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:29,422
We got an address on him?

228
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,301
No. This address is false.

229
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,161
It doesn't exist.

230
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,463
That's it, his visa expired.
He's here illegally,

231
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,111
And he probably doesn't
want to be found.

232
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:37,280
He does have a personal reference -
On his INS form. - Who?

233
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:38,922
Muhtadi Gohar.

234
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,152
He lives at the G street
mosque in Georgetown.

235
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,211
He's the imam there.

236
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:44,143
He might be able to
help us find Al-Zarian.

237
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,133
We need to talk to him.
Put out an APB

238
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:48,401
On Al-Zarian,
run it through the interagency database.

239
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:49,302
See what else you can find.

240
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:50,980
Fax everything over to the car.

241
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,063
Great work.

242
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:55,811
Jack, wait.

243
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:58,151
Are you sure you're
up for this?

244
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:01,521
I have to see this through.

245
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,160
Please.

246
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:07,463
I can help.

247
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,793
Okay. Let's go.

248
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,631
Come in.

249
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,041
Ma'am, Mr.
Collier here to see you.

250
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:19,243
Thank you, Agent Pierce.

251
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:20,671
That'll be all.

252
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,713
I appreciate you
coming, Martin.

253
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,182
It's been a long time.
You look good.

254
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:30,401
Thanks.

255
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,583
So, olivia,
I know why you asked me here,

256
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:38,092
But I have to tell you, having me dig
up dirt On Noah Daniels is one thing.

257
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:39,981
This is a whole
different animal.

258
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,173
I'm aware of that, Martin.

259
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:45,793
I want this to happen.
I want this person taken care of.

260
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,463
It's Jonas Hodges.

261
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,453
- Starkwood? - Yes.

262
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,910
What in god's name do
you have against him?

263
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:57,390
I don't know how much of this will get
out, But Hodges was behind everything

264
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,712
That happened today,
from the planes going down

265
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,383
To the attack on
the White House.

266
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:02,612
- What? - It's true.

267
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,972
He's also responsible for
the death of my brother.

268
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,032
I thought your brother
killed himself.

269
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:13,492
He was murdered,
And Hodges was responsible.

270
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:14,730
Okay. But why?

271
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:18,902
It's complicated, Martin,
And I don't have time to go into it.

272
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,981
All you need to know is
Hodges worked a deal.

273
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,090
Witness protection.

274
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:24,613
My mother approved it,
and he's going free...

275
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,132
Unless someone intervenes.

276
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:29,840
- Okay, can I give you a little advice?
- What?

277
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,692
This is big game. Walk away.

278
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,352
I can't do that.

279
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:36,551
Once this happens, Once it goes through,
you can never go back.

280
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:38,951
You will live with it for
the rest of your life.

281
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:41,983
I don't need a lecture on
conscience from you, Of all people.

282
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,110
I have thought this through.

283
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:56,581
What I can't live with Is that
monster getting away with this.

284
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,220
He has to pay for what he did.

285
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:10,483
So, uh, where's Hodges now?

286
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:13,281
In FBI custody,
downtown Bureau.

287
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,290
Deal has been signed.

288
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,421
He's being released into witness
protection Within the hour.

289
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:20,733
Here's his itinerary.

290
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:25,201
When he walks out that door,
we lose him.

291
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,700
He disappears forever.

292
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,931
This has got to happen fast.

293
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:32,942
Martin.

294
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:40,441
All right.

295
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:41,882
I'll make a call.

296
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:45,021
I'll get you contact information,
a price,

297
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:47,790
And instructions on how
to transfer the funds.

298
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,453
Thank you.

299
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:53,622
You'll hear from me soon.

300
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:22,551
Mr. Hodges, This is U.S.
Marshal Sullivan.

301
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:24,152
I'm placing you in his custody.

302
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:27,360
He'll take you to
witness protection.

303
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,562
Thank you for your hospitality,
young lady.

304
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:39,941
This dossier outlines your new identity,
Your new place of residence,

305
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:43,511
All the information you're going
to need to make this transition.

306
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:49,410
Robert Tippett?
That's my new name?

307
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,320
Yes, sir.

308
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:57,151
Sounds like a dog breed.

309
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:01,022
Our first stop is the Witt-Sec
facility in Colorado.

310
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:05,763
We'll put the finishing touches on your
new biography, Fabricate your new ID,

311
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,601
Get you into counseling.

312
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,300
Counseling?

313
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:13,870
It helps entrants deal with
their new circumstances.

314
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,440
Son, you know who I am.

315
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:19,410
Do I impress you as someone who needs
therapy To cope with new circumstances?

316
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:24,650
The service is available if you want it,
sir, Courtesy of the American taxpayer.

317
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,553
You think I'm getting off easy,
don't you?

318
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:30,591
I don't think anything.

319
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:38,801
I can smell attitude, son,
And you're giving it off pretty thick.

320
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:43,601
I've lost everything--
My company, my family,

321
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:46,540
And most importantly, my name.

322
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:51,073
You know how much blood and sweat went
into making that name mean something?

323
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:57,110
We leave for Andrews Air
Force base in 30 minutes.

324
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,721
I suggest you get ready.

325
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:32,982
Jack?

326
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:34,761
I'm fine.

327
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,983
What are you doing? We don't even
know that they've done anything yet.

328
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:41,782
They could be innocent.

329
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:42,932
Innocent? You heard Hodges.

330
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,512
They're gonna use sleeper cells
to carry out these attacks.

331
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:47,361
Al-zarian might not have
been knowingly complicit

332
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:50,830
About everything that happened today,
But innocent? No.

333
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:56,213
Yes?

334
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:58,942
This is agent Walker with FBI.

335
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:00,381
Mr. Gohar?

336
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:02,160
Yes.

337
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:05,180
We're sorry to bother you at such
a late hour, But we need your help.

338
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:06,552
My help?

339
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,680
To stop a potential
terrorist attack.

340
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:15,692
Mr. Gohar?

341
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,712
I know you.

342
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,943
My name is jack bauer.

343
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:25,253
Of course.

344
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,733
I watched your
testimony on television.

345
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:31,121
Sir. Can we talk to you inside?

346
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,292
Please.

347
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,682
What do you want?

348
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:02,920
We're looking for a
man who worships here.

349
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,593
We believe he may be Helping
to plan another attack

350
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,363
That may be happening soon,
in D.C.

351
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:10,091
I knew the blame would
eventually fall on us.

352
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:12,591
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.

353
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:13,803
Do you know him?

354
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,630
And why do you think
he's a terrorist?

355
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,193
He fits a specific profile.

356
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,970
You mean, he is a muslim.

357
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,272
He's a pakistani national.

358
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,112
His visa lapsed a year ago.

359
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:24,842
And he has no legal address.

360
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,781
He listed you as a personal
reference on his INS form.

361
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:30,551
Where someone worships is private
information, protected by law.

362
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:31,843
Right now, finding al-zarian

363
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:34,311
Is the only way we're going to
prevent an attack against civilians.

364
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:36,852
So, I ask you again,
sir, do you know him?

365
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,920
Look at the photo!

366
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:48,830
Yes, I know him.

367
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,803
But he is not a terrorist!

368
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,501
What makes you so sure?

369
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:55,913
Jibraan has come to me many
times for spiritual advice.

370
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:57,471
I know the man.

371
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:00,611
He is not violent and
he is not an extremist.

372
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,643
We have evidence that
indicates otherwise.

373
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:04,182
I would like to
see this evidence.

374
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:04,982
Listen to me.

375
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:06,942
We did not come here to
debate this with you.

376
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:08,180
Where does he live?

377
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:09,481
I don't know where he lives.

378
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:11,381
- Where does he work? -
I don't know that, either.

379
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,552
And I don't believe you!

380
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:14,120
But you expect me
to believe you?

381
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:17,790
I watched your hearing at the senate,
I know what you have done.

382
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,331
So, tell me why should I
believe anything you say to me?

383
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,421
First because you
don't have a choice.

384
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:24,270
Second, because I am
telling you the truth!

385
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:27,040
The truth is that you come
into a house of worship

386
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:29,041
With information
you should not have,

387
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:32,983
An outrageous accusation,
no legal warrant, and threaten me.

388
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:35,181
I have not threatened you.

389
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:36,450
Not yet.

390
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,511
But we both know
where this is going.

391
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:39,982
If you're so sure
he's innocent,

392
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:42,423
- Why are you afraid to tell
us where he is? - Jack...

393
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:43,421
Where is he?!

394
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:45,292
I told you, I don't know.

395
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:49,562
But even if i did,
I would say nothing.

396
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,392
I would not help you
arrest an innocent man.

397
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:56,502
This is agent Walker.

398
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:57,732
It's Janis.

399
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:01,440
A DCPD officer recognized Jibraan
Al-zarian from a domestic

400
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:03,271
disturbance call
he took 15 minutes ago.

401
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:06,582
The address is 2700 eastbrook,
Apartment 3.

402
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,271
All right, good.
Coordinate with DCPD.

403
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:09,943
Set up an envelope and put the
building under surveillance

404
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,212
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

405
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:12,603
We have an address
on Al-zarian.

406
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,113
- Let's go, Jack.
- Turn around.

407
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,581
- Why? - I said turn around.

408
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:17,751
- Put your hands up, now!
- Jack?

409
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,020
What are you doing, Jack?

410
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:21,333
I'm not letting him call
Al-zarian Before we get there.

411
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,321
- He's coming with us.
- You have no right!

412
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:26,403
- I have done nothing wrong!
- Shut up!

413
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:32,472
...there will be none,
only our vengeance.

414
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:36,172
And this is only the beginning.

415
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:41,041
We will strike again and again In the
name of all that is great and righteous.

416
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:44,781
All right, fine.

417
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,281
The staging team's
ready and waiting on us.

418
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,880
This'll be uploaded
in two minutes.

419
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:51,923
Good.

420
00:23:55,597 --> 00:23:58,460
Jibraan...

421
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,361
We're getting
ready to move out.

422
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,672
I'm gonna need you to
talk to your brother.

423
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,301
Tell him what we discussed.

424
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:08,903
Go ahead and wake him up.

425
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:11,540
Please, I can't do this.

426
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,242
Yes, you can.

427
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:16,653
And you will.

428
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:19,481
How do I know you won't
kill Hamid anyway?

429
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:23,951
Because we need him to tell the police
That his brother's a terrorist.

430
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:29,620
Believe me,
You're saving his life by doing this.

431
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:31,263
Now, come on, let's go.

432
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:40,443
Hamid, Hamid, calm down.

433
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,970
Don't be scared.

434
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,710
Jibraan, what is this?

435
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:45,343
Sorry we had to do it this way.

436
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,113
But you're not going to
be hurt anymore, okay?

437
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:49,210
We? Who is we?

438
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:50,070
What's happening?

439
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,743
I'll explain everything
to you, okay?

440
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:52,950
Who's he?

441
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:57,450
Um, he's a friend.

442
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,382
Your friend?
I know all your friends.

443
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,590
I've never seen him before.

444
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:02,461
That's because I have
kept him from you.

445
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:04,530
What are you talking about?

446
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:07,462
I have to tell you something.

447
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:10,672
I'm not the person
you think I am.

448
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:12,472
What?

449
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:16,241
I hate what this country
has done to our people.

450
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,212
And I'm working with these men.

451
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:22,810
They will help me strike back against
the evil that has been done to us.

452
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,283
Strike back?

453
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:27,021
I can't say any more than that.

454
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,892
I don't believe it.

455
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:34,620
This country brought us in, gave us
a home, That's what you always said.

456
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:36,962
Yeah, that was a lie.

457
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:40,901
I have been protecting you from
this rage I've always felt inside.

458
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:43,730
But now it is time for
you to know the truth.

459
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:46,041
It was the Americans who
killed our parents, Hamid.

460
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,873
I'm going to make them pay.

461
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:50,372
What have you done
to my brother?

462
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:52,330
You've poisoned his mind!
This isn't my brother!

463
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:53,600
They have not done
anything to me, okay.

464
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:56,183
It is very important you
accept what I'm saying to you.

465
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:57,680
Why are you telling me this?

466
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:03,921
When they ask you why I did what I did,
I want you to tell them.

467
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,960
Okay, no one will
blame you for anything.

468
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,532
You have done nothing wrong.

469
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:15,802
I know this is very difficult
for you to understand.

470
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,373
But over time, you will see.

471
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,110
I love you, Hamid.

472
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:38,923
You said today was a
bad day to be a muslim.

473
00:26:41,328 --> 00:26:43,862
Well, it's an even worse
day to be your brother.

474
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,332
All right, let's go.

475
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:50,772
Staging area's ready.

476
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:52,203
You stay here and finish up.

477
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,472
Understood.

478
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:55,643
Jibraan, don't do this.

479
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:59,043
Everything set?

480
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:01,843
Yeah, was the
brother convinced?

481
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:03,111
I'm not sure.

482
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:06,821
But even if he wasn't,
Once the attack happens, he will be.

483
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:08,981
Let's go.

484
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:30,761
Hello?

485
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:32,563
Hello?

486
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:37,573
Yes, yes, martin collier said
you'd be expecting my call.

487
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:39,340
He gave me the
target's itinerary.

488
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:40,811
I'm set to go.

489
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:44,382
Good. good,
so the terms are acceptable.

490
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,882
They are.

491
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,853
I just need you to
transfer the funds.

492
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:50,351
What's the account number?

493
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:55,450
International banking code
is Victor-six-bravo-one-bravo-one.

494
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:04,622
After the funds have been transferred,
I'll proceed.

495
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:07,060
There'll be no need for us
to have any further contact.

496
00:28:07,238 --> 00:28:08,600
All right, but what are you--

497
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:26,980
Yes?

498
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:28,991
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

499
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:31,821
I thought you should know your
father has asked to see you.

500
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:33,090
My father's here?

501
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:35,761
In light of the potential
bioweapon attack,

502
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:39,053
The president ordered him moved to
the white house for his safety.

503
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:41,202
Thank you, Aaron.

504
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,901
I just have something
to take care of.

505
00:28:43,078 --> 00:28:44,371
Tell them I'll be right there.

506
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:46,442
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:25,812
You've reached Martin Collier.

508
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,080
Please leave a message.

509
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:29,952
Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.

510
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:33,820
I spoke to the contact,
But I couldn't go through with it.

511
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:36,492
I decided to take your
advice and walk away.

512
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:39,123
Please call me as
soon as you can.

513
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:49,470
This is Bauer.

514
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:52,992
It's Chloe, I found something weird
about these hits on Jibraan Al-zarian.

515
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:53,801
Go ahead.

516
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:57,331
You know how I said that the two million
dollars Was deposited into his account

517
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:58,572
Over a period of six months?

518
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:00,300
Well, that wasn't right.
They were backdated.

519
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,610
What do you mean?

520
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:03,811
One of the trace algorithms
caught a discrepancy,

521
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:06,232
All that money was really just
deposited 30 minutes ago.

522
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:08,510
What about the extremist
websites he was visiting?

523
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:10,493
Same thing with
the time stamps.

524
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:12,521
The hits were backdated
30 minutes ago.

525
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:14,530
Are you absolutely positive?

526
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:16,333
It looks that way.

527
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:18,802
Jibraan could be innocent.

528
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:20,000
Okay, thanks.

529
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:22,372
What's going on, Jack?

530
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:24,703
Chloe found evidence that
Jibraan is being set up.

531
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:26,070
He's been framed.

532
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:28,001
Why would Almeida
frame an innocent man?

533
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:30,462
Because they wouldn't want to risk the
attack Not being carried out properly.

534
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,883
How could I be so stupid?

535
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:36,153
An innocent man is so
much easier to control.

536
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:40,823
All they needed was a muslim, They could
create whatever background they wanted.

537
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:45,062
Give me your hands.

538
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:48,462
I am surprised.

539
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,863
Why? You were right.

540
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:52,500
Not about Jibraan.

541
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:54,391
My experience with
the authorities,

542
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:58,801
The police is that they will go to any
lengths Not to admit they were wrong.

543
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:01,790
Even at the expense of
an Innocent man's life.

544
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:05,040
At least you didn't do that.

545
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:08,481
Please know that I forgive you.

546
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:11,482
I'm not asking for
your forgiveness.

547
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:14,851
Then i hope you can at
least forgive yourself.

548
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:19,060
I gave up on that
a long time ago.

549
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:26,131
It's never to late to turn towards god,
Mr. Bauer.

550
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:36,372
- That's enough?
- Yeah, thanks.

551
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,113
Thank you.

552
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:41,550
You don't need to
stay with me, Ally.

553
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:43,953
But they know where to
find me if they need me.

554
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:49,452
I thought it was important for
you to hear what's going on.

555
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:53,090
And for you to understand
why I did what I did.

556
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:55,133
You're the
president, sweetheart.

557
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:58,100
You don't owe me
an explanation.

558
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:00,161
There's my girl.

559
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,333
Hi, dad.

560
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:06,343
Livy, you can
squeeze a bit harder.

561
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,772
I won't break.

562
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:08,642
Oh, I might!

563
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:13,030
I'm sorry I couldn't
come to the hospital.

564
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:14,780
Don't be silly.

565
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:18,122
You're a godsend being
here helping your mom.

566
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:21,991
Just knowing you two
were speaking again,

567
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:24,022
Let alone working together,
that's enough.

568
00:32:24,195 --> 00:32:29,711
Henry, I'm not sure that our
d¨¦ente Is holding at the moment.

569
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:37,132
Olivia, your mother told me About
the deal she made with Jonas Hodges.

570
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:44,342
And I know you, understandably,
Have serious concerns about that.

571
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:48,983
Well, I've had some
time to think.

572
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:53,183
To put myself in
mom's position.

573
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:57,353
To be objective And pragmatic--

574
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:59,362
The way a good
leader should be.

575
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:01,360
Has to be.

576
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:04,561
I know that decision
was horrible for you.

577
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:07,260
But I do understand.

578
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:10,903
I'm sorry I made the
choice even harder.

579
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:15,942
Jonas Hodges will face
judgment one day.

580
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:18,910
If not in this life,
in the next.

581
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,940
Mr. Tippet.

582
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:55,981
Mr. Tippet.

583
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,050
Oh. sorry.

584
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:02,391
It's going to take me a little
while to get used to that.

585
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:04,051
Always does.

586
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,393
I'll need to
confiscate the wallet.

587
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:09,590
We can't let you hold on to anything
That ties you to your former life.

588
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,630
And the picture.

589
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:33,750
You like your job,
Mr. Sullivan?

590
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:35,753
It has its challenges.

591
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:37,612
You strike me as someone

592
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:41,792
who wouldn't be totally satisfied
ferrying prisoners around.

593
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:44,531
I don't plan on doing
this my entire life.

594
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:47,531
Good to hear that.

595
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:51,201
Maybe you and I can do some
work together some day.

596
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,503
Sir?

597
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:55,371
I don't intend to be Mr.
Tippet forever.

598
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:20,301
Sign here
acknowledging transfer.

599
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:56,162
FBI's identified

600
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:59,242
The man they believe is going to
carry out e bioweapon's attack.

601
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:02,390
Jack Bauer and agent Walker are on their
way To a possible location for him.

602
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,392
Have they found out anything that
would give us an idea of the target--

603
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,812
- Or a timetable? - No.

604
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,921
Nothing actionable. Not yet.

605
00:36:09,097 --> 00:36:10,090
Um, Madam president.

606
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:14,070
This is woods.

607
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:18,130
Are you sure?

608
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,773
How did this happen?

609
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:27,022
Call me as soon
as you know more.

610
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:34,280
What is it, Tim?

611
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:36,482
Jonas Hodges was just killed.

612
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,242
- What? How?
- Car bomb.

613
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:39,472
As he was leaving FBI.

614
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:42,182
What else do they know?

615
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:44,180
- Are there any suspects?
- Not yet.

616
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:46,350
Um, excuse me.

617
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:56,021
My guess is this
was an inside job.

618
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:57,563
Inside job?

619
00:36:57,736 --> 00:36:58,662
Whoever ordered the hit

620
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:01,233
Knew exactly when and where
hodges was being transported.

621
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:04,161
Damn it!

622
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,673
Tim, get on top of this.

623
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:08,232
I want to know exactly
how this happened.

624
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:09,871
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:37:16,388 --> 00:37:21,313
Ms. Taylor,
Is everything all right?

626
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:22,881
Oh, it's fine.

627
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:25,390
I'll be right back.

628
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:33,132
Yeah?

629
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:35,161
Hodges is dead!

630
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:36,063
Okay, calm down.

631
00:37:36,238 --> 00:37:38,200
We shouldn't be
talking on the phone.

632
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:41,332
You don't understand,
There's been a terrible mistake.

633
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,602
I spoke to the man whose
number you gave me.

634
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:45,273
But I didn't go
through with it.

635
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:46,073
I couldn't.

636
00:37:46,177 --> 00:37:47,513
Didn't you get my message?

637
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:48,612
Olivia, I said calm down.

638
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:50,010
I can't!

639
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:51,592
Hodges is dead and
I'm responsible.

640
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:54,012
We cannot have this
conversation over the phone.

641
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,581
Do you understand? Do you realize What
could happen to me if this gets out?!

642
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:58,153
Olivia, you need to
stop talking now.

643
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:59,052
Do you hear me?

644
00:37:59,228 --> 00:38:00,552
Take a deep breath,
listen to me.

645
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:02,222
All right, we'll hang up, okay?

646
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:03,292
All right.

647
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:04,363
Okay, I'm listening.

648
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:05,630
Okay.

649
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,291
Can you get to Pershing Park?

650
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:08,561
No, not right now.

651
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,200
I'm in a meeting
with my mother.

652
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,373
Fine. I'll wait.
Get there as fast as you can.

653
00:38:12,535 --> 00:38:14,703
We'll talk about
this face-to-face.

654
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:15,941
Okay?

655
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,011
All right.

656
00:38:35,466 --> 00:38:37,460
Thank you, Aaron.

657
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:00,351
What do you have, agent?

658
00:39:00,517 --> 00:39:02,523
Armed hostile in the back room,
holding a hostage.

659
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:03,583
What about Almeida?

660
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:04,682
He's not in there.

661
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:08,150
See for yourself. Reed, -
Give us another look. - Yes, sir.

662
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,660
Move in closer on the hostage.

663
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:16,802
Is that who you're looking for?

664
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,130
No.

665
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:20,301
That's Jibraan's
brother, Hamid.

666
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:24,043
They're using him as leverage,
to make Jibraan Do what they want.

667
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,010
How can you be sure?

668
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:26,153
'cause that's what
I would've done.

669
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:28,513
Agent, it is imperative that
we take this hostile alive.

670
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,313
Right now,
he's our only shot at finding out

671
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:31,611
Where this attack is
going taking place.

672
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:33,153
Understood. I've
already informed my men.

673
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:34,451
I want to run point on this.
Is that all right?

674
00:39:34,558 --> 00:39:37,180
Thanks.

675
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:40,151
You're going to stay here
With the backup teams.

676
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,823
Are you sure that's
such a good idea?

677
00:39:41,998 --> 00:39:43,822
What?

678
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:46,192
Agent Bauer--
he doesn't seem to be too well.

679
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:48,633
- Maybe you should be in charge.
- I am.

680
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:54,001
Jack was infected
with the bioweapon.

681
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:56,310
The same one that they are
going to use in this attack.

682
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,902
Then he should be
in the hospital.

683
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,271
There is no treatment.

684
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:01,212
He probably has less
than a day to live.

685
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:05,041
So if he is strong enough, trust me,
He's the best person for this job.

686
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:07,552
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

687
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:09,553
Agent Walker, we're ready.

688
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,892
Please, Mr.
Bauer, Do what you can to save Hamid.

689
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:14,521
We've checked the windows.

690
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,291
We have a clear approach.

691
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:21,560
- Let's go. -
Agents, stay with Mr. Gohar.

692
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,203
On my count.

693
00:40:58,377 --> 00:41:01,373
Three... two... one.

694
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:09,782
Hamid, stop!

695
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,610
Put it down.

696
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:13,383
We're FBI. We need him alive.

697
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,053
- Put it down. -
He made my brother into a terrorist.

698
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:17,650
Your brother is not a terrorist.
He's innocent.

699
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,083
We know that.
He's being set up.

700
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:21,421
- He's being forced to do this.
Please. - What?

701
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:22,760
The only one who can tell us

702
00:41:22,926 --> 00:41:24,962
Where your brother is
that man right there.

703
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:27,132
Now put it down.

704
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:30,933
Stand up now,
put your hands behind your head.

705
00:41:31,107 --> 00:41:32,631
Do it!

706
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:35,030
Agent Walker, move in now.

707
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:36,131
Move! On the bed

708
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,783
Damn it, he's bleeding out.
We need a medic, now!

709
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:44,741
We need a med team on site.

710
00:42:14,518 --> 00:42:17,511
Sit right there.

711
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:22,082
Are you in their system?

712
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,120
I've tapped into the main
security trunk line,

713
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,351
But I'm still looping in breakers to
make sure The tap doesn't get flagged.

714
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:29,493
All right, well,
we're on a timetable here.

715
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:31,193
How much longer is
it going to take?

716
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:33,061
Ten, maybe 15 minutes.

717
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:34,333
Hand me that case.

718
00:42:37,136 --> 00:42:39,161
What are you going
to have me do?

719
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:41,773
You'll find out soon enough.

720
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:52,012
Is the subway on schedule?

721
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:53,383
Yeah, it's on schedule.

722
00:42:53,496 --> 00:42:59,491
