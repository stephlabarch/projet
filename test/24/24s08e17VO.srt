3
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:16,015
Can I assume there is no change

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,059
in the status of president Hassan?

5
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,222
I'm afraid not.

6
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,475
Then he is still being
held by terrorists.

7
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:23,731
If Hassan dies,

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,359
- there is no treaty.
- If I didn't know better,

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,361
I'd think you were hoping
for that to happen.

10
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:31,933
Jack thinks that someone inside
of CTU is working for the terrorists.

11
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:34,158
Jack recovered Tarin's phone.

12
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,328
If someone did call and tip him off,
we can get the number off the memory.

13
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:38,996
It's Dana's.

14
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,583
I spoke to Hastings.
He cleared me through.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,652
Stay where you are
and keep your hands...

16
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,048
She entered the parking garage.

17
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,074
The only reason
you've got any leverage right now

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,849
is because Hassan is alive.

19
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,851
So stop screwing with me!

20
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,557
They are gonna force him
to make a statement,

21
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:05,272
and then they will kill him.

22
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,692
Just read the statement, Omar.

23
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:11,321
You will renounce
the peace agreement.

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,206
I will never do that.

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,700
He's stronger than we thought.

26
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:17,118
Bury him.

27
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,078
I will tell the world of his crimes.

28
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,680
<i>This man is not our president!</i>

29
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,732
<i>Looks like Samir's grabbed him.</i>

30
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:25,645
<i>We need you to get in there!</i>

31
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,586
I have a visual on Hassan.

32
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:29,046
Ready to engage.

33
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:42,836
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,238
<i>I have Jack Bauer
on the line for you.</i>

35
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,007
Put him through.

36
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:15,050
<i>Madam president,
I don't know what to say</i>

37
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:17,451
except that I'm sorry.

38
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,608
I trust there was nothing

39
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,766
you and your team
could have done differently.

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,938
President Hassan was dead
before we even got there.

41
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:30,273
Then you don't owe me an apology.

42
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:32,477
I failed you, ma'am.

43
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,913
It was Hassan's choice
to surrender himself

44
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,816
in order to save American lives.

45
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,699
It was out of your hands.

46
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:43,192
Don't put this responsibility
on yourself.

47
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,583
You need to keep
this peace agreement alive.

48
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,694
There can't be any agreement

49
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,922
when the IRK is without a leader.

50
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,382
The hardliners there
will take advantage of the vacuum

51
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,051
and reverse all the progress
we made with Hassan.

52
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:59,749
I'm gonna have
to address the delegates

53
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:03,173
in a few minutes and announce
the dissolution of the peace summit,

54
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:04,642
and formally release them.

55
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,674
If you give up, it means they win.

56
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,904
I don't see another choice, Jack.

57
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:10,928
I wish to god I did.

58
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:14,878
Good-bye, Jack.

59
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,984
- What's his condition?
- He took a round to the shoulder,

60
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:29,778
another through the abdomen,
but it exited clean. BP looks steady.

61
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:32,317
We need this guy for questioning.
Will he make it or not?

62
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,993
Doesn't look like any vitals were hit.
He'll live.

63
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:38,469
We'll transport him back to CTU.
Medical will take him for now.

64
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,933
President Taylor is going to announce
the end of the peace conference.

65
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,507
- You did everything you could.
- It wasn't enough.

66
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,906
We should get back to CTU.

67
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:41,132
Why?

68
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:44,614
The fuel rods have been recovered.
The peace conference is over.

69
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:47,620
Everybody who was responsible
is either dead or in custody.

70
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,004
How's Samir?

71
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,423
Still unconscious,
but the EMTs say he'll make it.

72
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,075
Stay with him.
I'm handing over complete authority

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,261
and responsibility
for his transport to you.

74
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,420
Are you heading back to CTU?

75
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,598
We're going home. We're done.

76
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,061
Hastings is still gonna want
to debrief both of you.

77
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,062
I'm sure he will.
He knows how to find me.

78
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,066
I'm sorry it ended up like this.

79
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:18,767
Me, too.

80
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,269
You're a good agent. I wouldn't be
standing here without you.

81
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,951
I hope everything works out.
I'll pack my kit up downstairs.

82
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:40,547
The delegates are assembled
in the lounge, as you requested.

83
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,525
Let's get this over with.

84
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,765
<i>... discontinue the peace summit
that was to be</i>

85
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,050
<i>a cornerstone of her administration.</i>

86
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:55,174
<i>President Hassan apparently
had been kidnapped earlier,</i>

87
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,606
- <i>and then taken to...</i>
- Jamot.

88
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:00,090
On behalf of my country,

89
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:03,255
you have our deepest sympathy
for this terrible tragedy.

90
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,341
Though, on a personal level,

91
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,740
I imagine
you have mixed feelings right now.

92
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:09,410
Beg your pardon?

93
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:12,997
Hassan had you arrested without cause
during his purge of suspected enemies.

94
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:15,873
Allowed you to be
brutally interrogated.

95
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,377
I would think
you have little love for the man.

96
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,281
President Hassan
was under tremendous duress,

97
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:22,816
and he lost his way,

98
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,676
but I never stopped
believing in what he stood for.

99
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,931
Of course.
I meant no offense.

100
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:31,140
I'm sure you didn't.
Excuse me.

101
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,317
Minister Jamot.

102
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,111
If you can spare a few moments,
I need to speak with you.

103
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,858
I will be happy to sit down with you
after I have addressed the delegations.

104
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,869
I know you're intending to announce
the end of the peace summit,

105
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,328
but there may be a way
to prevent that from happening.

106
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:55,748
Before you do anything,

107
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,899
I need you to hear
what I have to say.

108
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:01,419
All right.

109
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,923
- Ma'am, what about the delegates?
- Just give me a moment.

110
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,682
- Let's go in here.
- Please.

111
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:21,815
Samir's men were all dead,
thanks to the Americans.

112
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,883
Samir was the only one left,

113
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,236
but I took care of him.

114
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:30,428
So, there's no connection to us?
We're in the clear?

115
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,553
<i>Maybe not.</i>

116
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,662
There was a woman there
who might have recognized me.

117
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,980
What woman?

118
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,840
She may be CTU...
I'm not sure... But...

119
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,251
I've seen her face before.

120
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,284
Where?

121
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,280
Six years ago,
when we were using that mobster,

122
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,805
Vladimir Laitanan,

123
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,844
to smuggle military weapons
out of the country,

124
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,451
<i>she was with him.</i>

125
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,494
Are you sure it was her?

126
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,712
I don't forget faces.

127
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:58,602
Where is she now?

128
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,920
In a taxicab,

129
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:03,572
just ahead of me, with Jack Bauer.

130
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:07,736
Are they going to CTU?

131
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,455
I don't think so, no.

132
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,611
Then, it seems unlikely
she recognized you.

133
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,020
<i>Better not to take the chance.</i>

134
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,330
I'll take out Bauer, too,
while I'm at it.

135
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:22,834
The Americans believe the IRK
were solely behind the recent attacks.

136
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,163
Killing Bauer and this woman
would only alert them

137
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,234
to the fact that others
were involved.

138
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,799
How long before they discover
that it was us?

139
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,718
It will take even less time

140
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,736
<i>if this woman remembers me.</i>

141
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,375
<i>What are my orders?</i>

142
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,690
Continue to follow them...
Keep them in sight...

143
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:43,981
And I'll get back to you.

144
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:12,593
I don't have the words

145
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:15,331
to tell you and Kayla
how sorry I am.

146
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:20,601
I know you did
everything in your power.

147
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,939
Jamot, I wasn't aware
that you were here.

148
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,984
I only arrived a short time ago.

149
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,141
I want you to know that,

150
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,316
in our last few hours together,

151
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,478
Omar expressed his regrets to me,

152
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:38,401
not the least of which
was his treatment of you.

153
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,482
I appreciate that.

154
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:45,648
I realize our timing is intrusive,

155
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:48,397
but there's something
we need to discuss privately.

156
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,047
Did you find him?

157
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:52,212
The man who killed my father?

158
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:53,634
Samir Mehran.

159
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,898
He was badly wounded,
but he'll live to stand trial.

160
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:01,465
And, believe me,
he would pay dearly for what he's done.

161
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,488
Kayla, darling,

162
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,938
I need to speak
with president Taylor alone.

163
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,879
Give us a few minutes.

164
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,203
What is it
that you wish to talk to me?

165
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,164
As you know,
for almost a year, your husband and I

166
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,827
worked to make
this peace agreement a reality.

167
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:30,750
In that time,
I saw the kind of leader he was.

168
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,962
He managed against difficult odds

169
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,133
to bring a fractious and contentious

170
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,801
parliament together.

171
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:38,916
Now that he's gone,

172
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,723
your country is going
to be thrown into turmoil.

173
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:44,335
I am aware of the challenges
that we are facing.

174
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,520
Why are you telling me this?

175
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:49,849
Clearly, someone needs
to take the reigns

176
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:51,441
of the IRK government.

177
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,819
Someone who believes
in the same ideals

178
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:57,904
and principles as Omar Hassan,
and who shares his strength.

179
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,457
Minister Jamot believes

180
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,453
that person should be you.

181
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:05,103
What?

182
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,211
I'm not the only one who believes it.
I've spoken to our delegation,

183
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,004
as well as with the other members
of our cabinet back home.

184
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:16,091
You represent our best.
Our only real chance

185
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,344
to preserve our government
and your husband's agenda.

186
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,215
You are out of your mind!

187
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,520
I am no politician.

188
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,627
But you are a martyr's wife.

189
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:30,063
And history has proven
that to be something far more powerful.

190
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,649
You have always been popular
with the people.

191
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,360
The vast majority of them
want peace.

192
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,617
They'll rally around you.

193
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,581
The council of guardian
will have no choice

194
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:42,451
but to recognize you
as successor to the presidency.

195
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,119
But I have a choice.

196
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:46,872
You assume too much of me.

197
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:57,746
I realize
that this is a lot to consider,

198
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,984
especially now
while you're grieving,

199
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:05,154
but without a unifying figure
to hold your country together,

200
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,547
everything your husband worked for,

201
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:09,172
will be for nothing.

202
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,865
My marriage to Omar
was far from perfect.

203
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,692
We had many problems
for a very long time.

204
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:27,106
I know only too well,

205
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:29,283
how difficult it is for a marriage

206
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,552
to survive a life in politics.

207
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:35,400
But through it all,
I never stopped loving him.

208
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,875
Or sharing his desire
for better relations with the west.

209
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
If it is the will of my people

210
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,180
and of my government,

211
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:56,942
I will take my husband's place
at the peace conference.

212
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,596
It will be my honor
to stand with you.

213
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:04,199
We'll make the announcement together
from the United Nations.

214
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,078
Thank you.

215
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:24,404
- She's going to do it.
- That's incredible news.

216
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,894
I want every delegate
contacted personally.

217
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,102
Tell them to cancel any plans
to leave the country.

218
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,077
We are returning to the UN.

219
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:34,516
I'll also call CTU
and implement those changes

220
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:35,897
if you still agree.

221
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,703
That's your decision.

222
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,398
Do what you think is best.

223
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:45,699
Where's Bauer?

224
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,794
He left the scene,
took Renee with him.

225
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,647
Hassan's death hit him pretty hard.

226
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,557
Samir's been taken to medical.

227
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:53,123
- Is he conscious?
- Barely.

228
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,269
Let me know
when he's ready for questioning.

229
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:56,469
All right.

230
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,711
Put him through.

231
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,886
This is Tim Woods
with homeland security.

232
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,976
<i>I'll put you through
to Mr. Hastings.</i>

233
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:07,375
Actually, I'm calling
to speak with you.

234
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,222
Me? Are you sure?

235
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,343
I know this is unusual,
so I'll get straight to the point.

236
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:15,213
President Taylor and the dignitaries
are returning to the UN

237
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:16,924
where she'll announce her intent

238
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,149
to move forward with the signing
of the agreement.

239
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:22,762
Excuse me, but how can she do that
without Hassan?

240
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm not at liberty to say just yet,

241
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,217
but our immediate concern
is whether CTU is capable

242
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:29,493
of handling security
for the rest of the process.

243
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:33,038
It's already been infiltrated,
compromised more than once today.

244
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,313
<i>We</i> cannot <i>have any more mistakes.</i>

245
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:37,959
Are you suggesting
I'm responsible for those mistakes?

246
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,163
On the contrary.

247
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,371
I reviewed the hourly reports,
you've made some astute calls,

248
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,301
and have proven
to be very resourceful.

249
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:49,638
Why are you calling me?

250
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,726
I'm relieving Brian Hastings
of his post effective immediately.

251
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,688
We're now in the process
of suitable candidates to replace him,

252
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,632
but until we find someone,
you'll have provisional command.

253
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,528
You're putting me in charge?

254
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,146
For the time being.

255
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,375
I know your record at CTU,
L.A. branch,

256
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,747
and how important you were
during the Sangala crisis.

257
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,161
Nobody in that building
has more experience.

258
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,002
This is a mistake. What happened
with Hassan, and everything else.

259
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:18,667
It wasn't Mr. Hastings' fault.

260
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,088
I don't have time
to debate this with you.

261
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,214
Division feels
you are the most qualified, and I agree.

262
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,227
My decision's made.
Now accept it, and let's move on.

263
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:28,843
<i>Does Mr. Hastings know?</i>

264
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,054
<i>Division's informing him
as we speak.</i>

265
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,314
Just try to make the transition
as quick and painless as possible.

266
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,447
I'll be in touch.

267
00:15:58,723 --> 00:15:59,723
Come in.

268
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,725
I want you to know, I don't think
it's fair what they're doing,

269
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,304
laying all the blame on you.

270
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:17,182
Everything that happens here
is my responsibility.

271
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:20,115
The successes and the failures.

272
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,375
I recruited Dana Walsh
into this agency,

273
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,703
I let the snake into the garden.

274
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,828
I need to review protocols with you.

275
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:39,115
Let's not waste any time.

276
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:47,797
- Did you live here long?
- Just during my recovery.

277
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:53,556
I still think
I got some coffee around here.

278
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,168
What's her name, your granddaughter?

279
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,004
Teri.

280
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,431
Kim named her after her mom.

281
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,672
Listen,

282
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,419
I know that we've said
a lot of things to each other,

283
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:36,280
and you've made promises
to me about...

284
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,436
I want you to know
that I'm not gonna hold you to them.

285
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,425
It's been a terrible day,
and I know that we say things,

286
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,859
I don't want you to...

287
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Hello?

288
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,257
Somebody there?

289
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:31,212
Take my briefcase to marine one,
and tell the secret service

290
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,911
I'll be ready to leave shortly.

291
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:34,964
And send Mr. Novakovich in.

292
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:36,256
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:46,244
Mr. Novakovich.

294
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:48,311
Thank you for seeing me.

295
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,562
Not at all.

296
00:19:50,113 --> 00:19:51,713
What can I do for you?

297
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,837
I just had a curious phone call
from Tim Woods

298
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,864
indicating that you are intending
to move forward

299
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,115
with the peace initiative
with the IRK.

300
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,201
- That's correct.
- May I ask

301
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,579
how you propose to do this,
considering their leader is dead?

302
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:09,315
I intended to answer that question

303
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,369
during my address to the assembly,
but since you're asking...

304
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:16,730
Dalia Hassan will be signing
the agreement in her husband's stead.

305
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:20,286
That's... an interesting idea,
madam president,

306
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:23,747
but I don't see how she would have
the authority to sign such a document.

307
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:25,890
She's getting it
from her government now.

308
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,276
Their parliament called
an emergency session

309
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,979
to ratify her
as provisional president.

310
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,878
The letter confirming that
is forthcoming.

311
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,868
Madam president,
I appreciate your optimism,

312
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:40,530
but I don't understand how you can
believe that installing Hassan's widow

313
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,533
as some kind of figurehead
will alleviate our concerns

314
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,451
about the instability
of the IRK government.

315
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:48,577
With president Hassan dead,

316
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:50,915
the opposition
will only get stronger.

317
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,540
Hassan's death
will galvanize his supporters

318
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:55,666
and every advocate
of this peace process

319
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,047
to endorse her as his successor.

320
00:20:58,483 --> 00:20:59,924
You can't be certain of that.

321
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:05,195
Once again, Mr. Novakovich,
you're giving every indication

322
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,320
that Russia has no interest
in this peace accord.

323
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:11,450
I'm sorry that you feel that way,

324
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:14,786
but the fact remains
that we are no longer confident

325
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:17,200
that any meaningful progress
can be made.

326
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,634
Respectfully,

327
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,766
my country will be declining
to sign your peace document.

328
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:23,377
Excuse me.

329
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,091
Do I need to take this up
with president Suvarov myself?

330
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,225
If you like, but I can assure you,

331
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,132
I have full authority
on this matter.

332
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,557
Any decision that I make
represents the formal position

333
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:37,086
of the Russian government.

334
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:41,044
Good day.

335
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:58,108
Agent Peters,
I need to see secretary Kanin now.

336
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:00,652
Liberty's on the move.

337
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:04,021
We managed to clear a blockage
in one of your coronary arteries,

338
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:07,694
and the x-rays show the heart damage
to be less than we expected.

339
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:10,158
In other words,
I'm a tough son of a bitch.

340
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,524
You're a lucky man,
I'll say that for you.

341
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,428
So I can resume my duties.

342
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,209
Although the procedure
was noninvasive,

343
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,252
take it easy for a little while.

344
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,799
That isn't a no.

345
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,758
Hello, Ethan.
How are you feeling?

346
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:27,220
I've seen better days.

347
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:29,681
Would you give us
a few moments, please?

348
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:31,084
Thank you.

349
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:37,079
You heard about Hassan?

350
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:38,982
Tim Woods told me.

351
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:43,098
He also filled me in on the IRK plan
to install Dalia Hassan.

352
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:45,836
What do you think?

353
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:48,951
Her family's well connected
and powerful.

354
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,482
It's an inspired idea.

355
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,577
Well, the Russians don't.

356
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,457
Novakovich told me in no uncertain terms
they won't accept her.

357
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,861
They're using it as an excuse
to pull out of the signing.

358
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:02,310
Even if the IRK has a new leader,

359
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:05,341
the peace agreement won't stand
without Moscow's endorsement.

360
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:07,218
I need your help, Ethan.

361
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,227
You got the Russians to the table.

362
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:11,222
What can I do to keep them there?

363
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,434
There may be someone
who can help us here.

364
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:17,272
But you're not gonna like it.

365
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,229
Who?

366
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,679
Charles Logan.

367
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:21,024
Logan?

368
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,282
Ethan, you can't be serious.

369
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:26,821
The man's a criminal.
I don't care if he was pardoned.

370
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,573
I didn't agree
with Daniels' decision, either,

371
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:32,432
but the fact is he's left
several messages at my office

372
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:33,959
over the past hour.

373
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:36,755
Apparently, he's aware
of the Russian reticence

374
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,625
in signing the agreement.
He's offered his assistance.

375
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:42,246
How could he possibly know
about this?

376
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,983
Despite his political downfall,
he's managed to maintain

377
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:47,758
a uniquely close relationship
with Moscow.

378
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,345
His messages indicated he has
information which might prove useful

379
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,913
in keeping the Russians
at the table.

380
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,683
What information?

381
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:57,523
He didn't say.

382
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:00,358
Allison...

383
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,557
I don't trust this man
any more than you do,

384
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,899
but I'd be remiss if I didn't urge you
to at least... hear him out.

385
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,123
Listen up.

386
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,046
I've never been very good
at good-byes.

387
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:28,726
But I want to tell you
what an honor it's been

388
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:30,885
for me to have served

389
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,103
with each and every one of you.

390
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,475
Division is now vetting names

391
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,843
to replace me.

392
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,562
In the meantime, Chloe O'Brian

393
00:24:42,117 --> 00:24:43,314
will be in charge,

394
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,943
and I'm sure you will show her
the same loyalty and commitment

395
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,197
that you've all shown me.

396
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:52,615
Thank you.

397
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,505
Don't worry, Chloe, you can do this.

398
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,673
I hope so.

399
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,824
I just want say,
we had a rough start,

400
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:14,550
but I eventually really enjoyed
working for you.

401
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:16,884
I'm happy to say
that I was wrong about you.

402
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,100
If I had listened to you
in the beginning,

403
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,920
maybe things
would have been different.

404
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:22,095
I doubt it.

405
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,349
I'll be at division debriefing.

406
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,858
But I'm available
if you have any questions.

407
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:28,860
Thank you, sir.

408
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,028
Good luck.

409
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:31,904
Mr. Hastings.

410
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,743
I have agent Ortiz on the line.
They have a situation in medical.

411
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,768
This one's all yours, Chloe.

412
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,846
Ms. O'Brian.

413
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:42,832
- It's Chloe.
- Where's Hastings?

414
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,835
He's not here.
What happened?

415
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,126
Samir's just gone
into cardiac arrest.

416
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,882
Four milligrams epinephrine
and 275 lidocaine.

417
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,177
I'll be right there.

418
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,055
Clear!

419
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:06,663
Going again at 360.

420
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,483
Clear!

421
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,414
I thought that was not serious.

422
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:26,250
So did I.
Where is Hastings?

423
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:29,003
- He's been removed by division.
- Who's in command?

424
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:29,962
I am.

425
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,130
Until they find a replacement.

426
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,133
You were with Samir?

427
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,551
From the scene, yes.

428
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,595
What about at the scene?

429
00:26:38,336 --> 00:26:39,805
He may have been out of my sight.

430
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,639
Emergency personnel were with him.

431
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,186
We got to move his body
for an autopsy.

432
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,980
Not yet.
Order a preliminary toxicology panel.

433
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,483
- They'll run a full panel.
- I want it now!

434
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,028
He was barely conscious.
He couldn't have taken something off.

435
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:56,948
Somebody could've given it to him.

436
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:03,079
Do what she says.

437
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:06,553
I'll be in Hastings' office...
My office.

438
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:08,223
Let me know when you find something.

439
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:30,151
A few of the more conservative members
of our delegation

440
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:32,126
may continue to resist you.

441
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,910
But...

442
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,362
we can persuade them.

443
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:38,781
Perhaps if I spoke
to them personally.

444
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,620
A very good idea.

445
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:49,166
Miss Kayla,

446
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,461
I didn't get a chance to tell you
how deeply sorry I am.

447
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:53,947
Thank you.

448
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:59,614
I will see you both back at the UN.

449
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:05,016
The UN?
I thought you were going home.

450
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:06,399
Not yet.

451
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:09,300
There are new developments.
I'll explain them to you on the way.

452
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,775
What is going on?

453
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:14,461
Why did President Taylor and Jamot
want to speak with you alone?

454
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:17,528
They have asked me
to consider staying on...

455
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:19,854
to complete your father's work.

456
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:23,117
I don't understand.
What does that mean?

457
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:27,420
Our party wishes to appoint me
as the new President.

458
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,158
What was your answer?

459
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:38,027
You told them you couldn't accept,
not after what's happened.

460
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,627
Our country
is on the verge of a coup

461
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,891
by the people responsible
for the murder of your father.

462
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,681
Someone must lead.

463
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,351
You can't beat them,
don't you realize that by now?

464
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,144
I don't believe that, I won't.

465
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,640
The greatest blow I can strike
against them is to sign the agreement.

466
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:57,688
- This will be your father's legacy.
- It will be a death sentence for you!

467
00:28:57,813 --> 00:29:00,355
You want peace to live,
but all these people want is anarchy.

468
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,530
They'll kill you!

469
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,698
Enough!

470
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:11,214
You are not the only one
who has suffered today.

471
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:15,161
This was not
an easy decision for me,

472
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,002
but it was mine to make.

473
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:21,700
I don't need you
to remind me of the danger.

474
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:24,131
I need you to help me be strong.

475
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:30,230
Now, pull yourself together.
There is a car waiting for us.

476
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:45,116
I'm sure the media
does want a response, but I'm not ready

477
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,008
to give them one just yet.

478
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,283
They'll have to wait.
All right.

479
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,654
Thank you.

480
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:55,507
The press secretary says the Russians
are leaking to the news channels

481
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:58,421
their intention to reluctantly
pull out of the talks.

482
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,464
They don't like wasting time.

483
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:02,675
Has my guest arrived?

484
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:05,724
I had secret service bring him

485
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:08,305
and deliver him discreetly
to conference room number three,

486
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:09,961
as you asked.

487
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:11,058
Thank you.

488
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:41,545
Let me convey my condolences
on the loss of President Hassan.

489
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:43,716
I know you worked closely with him.

490
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,934
This must be very hard for you.

491
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:49,542
Thank you, for your sympathy.

492
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,601
If you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to you alone.

493
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,723
This is my executive assistant,
Jason Pillar.

494
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,205
I assure you he can be trusted.

495
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:02,343
Forgive me if I don't give much weight
to your endorsement.

496
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:03,868
He needs to leave.

497
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:07,393
Will you excuse us?

498
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,623
Let's get something straight.

499
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:18,918
I agreed to this meeting
only at the behest of secretary Kanin.

500
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:24,298
Now, I'm not sure
you're entirely aware of the situation.

501
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,725
My understanding is,
the Russians are rejecting Dalia Hassan

502
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,788
as a legitimate successor, as a result,
won't sign off on the peace agreement.

503
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,247
You're well informed.

504
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:36,602
I have close friends in Moscow.

505
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,104
In some ways, people there

506
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,941
appreciate me more
than people in my own country.

507
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,070
It wasn't their constitution
you trampled.

508
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,968
The Russians have been trying
to back out of this agreement

509
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:51,385
from day one.

510
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,175
Do you honestly think

511
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,538
your relationships
can change their minds?

512
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,106
I'm certain I can.

513
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:59,291
- How?
- Let's just say

514
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:02,598
I'm going to be able
to exercise some leverage.

515
00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:05,242
What kind of leverage?

516
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,300
If it gets the job done,
does it really matter?

517
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:11,095
- It does to me.
- I can promise you

518
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,654
no laws will be broken,
nothing will tarnish you,

519
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,098
but the details

520
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:19,311
really must stay
between me and the Russians.

521
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,238
You and Hassan created the framework

522
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:29,321
for the most significant peace
in a generation, and you...

523
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,096
got the entire world behind it.

524
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,137
To let the Russians tear down

525
00:32:34,262 --> 00:32:36,803
what should be the crown jewel
in your administration...

526
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,322
Don't play me.

527
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,425
This is about you
trying to repair your reputation.

528
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:47,396
Is that so hard to understand?

529
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,763
You participated in a conspiracy

530
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:52,052
to cover up the assassination
of David Palmer.

531
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,437
I was trying to protect the country
from an unnecessary trauma...

532
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,499
You were doing
what was best for yourself.

533
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,798
You're right.

534
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,821
You're right.
I suppose I've spent so many years

535
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:13,291
trying to justify my actions

536
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,716
that it's become difficult for me...

537
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:19,945
to own up to the truth.

538
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:24,944
I made mistakes.

539
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:27,806
Terrible mistakes,

540
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:30,604
that stained
the office of the presidency.

541
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:35,218
And for which I will be paying
the rest of my life.

542
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:40,557
But I still can be of value
to my country.

543
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,810
I can still do some good.

544
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,216
We both know you wouldn't
have called me

545
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,010
unless you were out of options.

546
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,616
So we can continue

547
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,888
to do well on the past, or you can
let me pursue the only chance you have

548
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:01,163
of resurrecting the peace process.

549
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,137
Please.

550
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:09,191
Let me help you.

551
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:14,624
All right.

552
00:34:16,608 --> 00:34:17,608
Thank you.

553
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:21,225
What do you intend to do first?

554
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:24,804
Arrange a meeting
with the Russian delegate Novakovich.

555
00:34:25,984 --> 00:34:27,596
Get a message to him at his hotel.

556
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:30,109
Tell him that you are sending
over your official emissary

557
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:32,927
to have a talk with him.

558
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:35,489
What if he doesn't agree
to this meeting?

559
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:38,520
Make sure he knows it's me.
He'll agree to it.

560
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:43,102
God help you
if you make me regret this.

561
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,403
You okay?

562
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:16,765
Perfect.

563
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:17,979
Promise?

564
00:35:21,863 --> 00:35:23,163
I am so thirsty.

565
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:24,702
Me, too.

566
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,067
Do you want something to drink?

567
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,192
Sure.

568
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,689
I'll be right back.

569
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:52,547
Don't move.

570
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:10,709
Your cell's ringing.

571
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,732
Don't worry about it, let it go.

572
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:23,972
Hello.
Jack's phone.

573
00:36:24,674 --> 00:36:26,554
- I need to talk to Jack.
- <i>What's wrong?</i>

574
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,102
Samir Mehran is dead.
I think he was assassinated.

575
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:31,789
What do you mean, assassinated?

576
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:33,841
<i>I ran
a preliminary toxicology report.</i>

577
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:35,987
It showed traces
of an unidentified toxin

578
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,362
in his bloodstream.

579
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:40,427
Someone must have injected him
with it, probably at the scene.

580
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:45,118
There was an EMT there.
He looked familiar.

581
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,957
There was so much going on,
I didn't take much notice.

582
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,915
Familiar? From where?

583
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:54,086
I need you to get my FBI case files.
Get me everything on red square.

584
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,084
You think
he was from the Russian mob?

585
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,091
He looked like somebody
who was with Laitanan

586
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,897
during the time I was under.

587
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:01,760
That was six years ago.
Are you sure?

588
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:05,264
Honestly, no.
Just send me the case files,

589
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:09,304
all the surveillance photos
and I'll see if he's in there.

590
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,505
You need to hear this.

591
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,542
<i>Are you there?</i>

592
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,503
Don't talk,
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.

593
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,589
- <i>Did something happen?</i>
- Who is this?

594
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:42,718
Renee's been hit by a sniper.

595
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,470
I need a trauma team
at St. Andrew's now.

596
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:47,718
Hold on, stay with me.

597
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:49,869
Let's go.

598
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,924
Keep everybody in the lobby.
There's a sniper.

599
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:30,049
Call 911.

600
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,207
Now!

601
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:38,649
Move!

602
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,114
We need to get to the hospital,

603
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,658
on the 22nd and ninth.

604
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:58,251
You can make it.

605
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,576
Wait... Just wait.

606
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,845
We're gonna make it. I promise.

607
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:12,057
Come on!
We've got to get there now!

608
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:20,261
Come on, come on.

609
00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:21,386
I got you.

610
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,822
You'll be all right.
We're almost there.

611
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,460
They're near from your hospital

612
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:31,551
and should be there any minute.
Make sure she's given priority care.

613
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:32,676
Thank you.

614
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:35,781
Pull up satellite.
Isolate the areas

615
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,582
between 8th Avenue
and West 18th street.

616
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,638
- What's going on?
- Walker was just shot.

617
00:39:39,763 --> 00:39:41,806
- What?
- Just do what I asked.

618
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:44,156
Jack said the sniper
was positioned at his apartment

619
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,882
at 1145 west 18th street.

620
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:48,468
- Roll back the feed 3 minutes.
- Is she gonna be okay?

621
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,262
He's rushing her to the hospital.

622
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,973
I don't get it.
Why would anyone want to kill Renee?

623
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:57,394
Help!

624
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,104
She's been shot!
No exit wound!

625
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,481
We got a gunshot wound to the chest.
Let's move.

626
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:05,463
- What's her pulse?
- 110, respiratory is still ragged.

627
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:08,405
- Check her carotid.
- BP is 80 over 50.

628
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:14,048
- Five is epped.
- How many gunshot wounds?

629
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:16,592
- One in the chest.
- Is patient typing crossed?

630
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,446
Call the blood bank,
send up four units of O-negative.

631
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,618
<i>It's Chloe.
How is she?</i>

632
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:56,453
Not good.

633
00:40:58,242 --> 00:41:01,249
We rolled back satellite.
The shots were fired

634
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,567
<i>from an office across the street.</i>

635
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:06,224
<i>PD reported finding a body
at the scene.</i>

636
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:07,672
What about the shooter?

637
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:11,176
We don't have anything.
We lost him.

638
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:14,930
You were on the phone with her.
What were you talking about?

639
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:18,141
It's not important right now.

640
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,022
- <i>Be with her.</i>
- She's in surgery, I can't.

641
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:22,896
What were you talking about?

642
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,359
I told her Samir Mehran was given
a lethal injection at the scene

643
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,014
of his capture,
probably to keep him from talking.

644
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:32,883
Renee thought she may have
recognized one of the EMT.

645
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:36,087
- She didn't say anything to me.
- She wasn't sure.

646
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:38,722
She didn't think
it meant anything at the time.

647
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,289
Where did she say
she remembered him from?

648
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,542
From her days undercover
with the Russian mob.

649
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:46,362
<i>She asked me to get her
the red square file.</i>

650
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:47,889
Did you pull up the file?

651
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,790
I gotta get back to you.

652
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:01,726
She didn't make it.

653
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:05,077
There was just too much
arterial damage and blood loss.

654
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:06,818
I'm very sorry.
