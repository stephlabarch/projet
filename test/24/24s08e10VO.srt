3
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:16,140
I don't want to see you ever again.

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,683
Do we have a deal or not?

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,519
Yeah, we got a deal.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,773
- I'm going after him.
- We're done.

7
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,900
We're just getting started.

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,827
We need to talk
about you having Tarin arrested.

9
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:38,996
I know you consider Tarin a friend.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,690
We are more than friends.

11
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:42,792
We're in love.

12
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:45,472
You've been carrying on
with this man...

13
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:47,546
behind my back?

14
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,716
- Who are these men?
- These are men I have recruited.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,843
We can't get the rods
out of the country,

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,012
so let's use them
as a radiological bomb.

17
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,474
We'll show the Americans
how strong we are.

18
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:04,897
Over here!

19
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,233
They are chasing me.

20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,027
<i>- They have the rods.</i>
- I thought you had the rods.

21
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,835
<i>They turned against me.</i>

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,699
- Just get me out of here.
<i>- We'll get you out.</i>

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,162
<i>When things get this colossally screwed
up people look for someone to blame.</i>

24
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,371
So what have you got in mind?

25
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,363
Renee Walker,
she killed our main leads.

26
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:25,543
She put her life on the line
when she didn't have to.

27
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,211
Someone has to pay for this.

28
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:29,277
<i>I'm sending someone over
from Justice,</i>

29
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:31,632
<i>Kristin Smith.
She'll take care of everything.</i>

30
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,843
They're setting you up,
don't say another word.

31
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:36,929
It's too late.

32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,806
This is over.
We're leaving now.

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,975
Hands in the air.
Do it now!

34
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:43,561
You offering to bring in Farhad?

35
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:47,982
If you drop the criminal investigation
against Renee Walker.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,553
If we do this, Jack,

37
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:52,695
it's not for one rescue operation,
it's till this whole thing

38
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,439
is over and done.

39
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,491
Deal.

40
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,591
We're about to transport him
to the embassy.

41
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:15,316
You have two minutes.

42
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,719
Thank you.

43
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,334
Bashir, clear the room.

44
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:28,022
- Tarin, did they hurt you?
- Not yet.

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,389
They won't until they get me
to our embassy.

46
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,653
I tried to reason with my father,
but he wouldn't listen.

47
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:37,031
He thinks you're involved
in the conspiracy with his brother.

48
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:41,052
Even after I told him about us,
he doesn't trust you.

49
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:42,119
You told him?

50
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:44,482
I hoped it would change his mind.

51
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,417
But if anything,
it's made things worse between us.

52
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,170
Come closer.

53
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:57,718
Listen,

54
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,737
there is a way out of this.

55
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,056
Bashir is still loyal to me.

56
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:05,226
He's agreed to help me escape.

57
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,772
As soon as he's able,
Bashir will slip me a handcuff key,

58
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,730
and he's placed a gun in the car.

59
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,692
- You won't hurt anyone?
- The gun is so I won't have to.

60
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,529
Once I'm free, I have a place to stay
until the Americans grant me asylum.

61
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:19,991
I want you to come with me.

62
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,591
Meet me at the Teodore Hotel.

63
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,912
Promise me you'll come.

64
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:28,165
Tarin, we need to go.

65
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:49,674
Cole, he's dead!

66
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,011
Just go.

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,983
What?

68
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,410
Just go.

69
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:57,917
Nobody knows you're involved.

70
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:01,032
It's my fault.
I lied about everything.

71
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,342
Who I am, what I've done.

72
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,927
I'll call the police.

73
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,696
I deserve
to take the blame for this.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,426
What's done is done.
We're cleaning this up,

75
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,232
and no one will ever know.

76
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,348
- I don't want you involved.
- I'm already involved.

77
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,435
We're gonna strip down his van
so it can't be I.D.'d.

78
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:31,979
We'll dump the bodies in the swamp.

79
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,926
They're scum, Dana,
and no one's gonna miss 'em.

80
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:41,489
You want to go to prison
for the rest of your life? For them?!

81
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,417
Get started on the van.

82
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,342
I'll go get the other one.

83
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,738
<i>Mr. Hastings,
the president's on the line.</i>

84
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:54,877
This is Hastings.

85
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,689
Mr. Hastings, I'm here with Rob Weiss.
I was told you have urgent news.

86
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,550
We received a call
from Farhad Hassan.

87
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,206
Yes. As we suspected,

88
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,931
he was trying to smuggle
the rods out of the country.

89
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,889
The people he's working with
have turned against him.

90
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,061
- What do we know?
- Farhad believes

91
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,674
they want to use the rods
to construct a dirty bomb

92
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,774
and set it off somewhere here in NY.

93
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,776
Why would they do this?

94
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:22,697
Between Hassan's crackdowns and CTU,
we've backed them into a corner.

95
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,470
This is their response.

96
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,872
Do you believe him?

97
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:26,951
Yes, I do.

98
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,706
Farhad is turning himself in.

99
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,904
He's agreed to help
us prevent this attack.

100
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,474
Where is Farhad now?

101
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,156
He's in a warehouse
just outside the city near Forest Hills.

102
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,753
I've enlisted Jack Bauer
to lock him down.

103
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,695
Now, Madam President,
the men who turned against Farhad

104
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,795
are covert assets for the I.R.K.

105
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,554
If we can get access
to the I.R.K. intelligence files,

106
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:49,662
Farhad may be able to help us
I.D. these men.

107
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:52,685
It will put us that much closer
to tracking them down.

108
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:55,378
They are the lifeblood of Hassan's
intelligence operation,

109
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:58,232
he'll never hand them over.
Especially in his current frame of mind.

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,359
The man's gone off the deep end.

111
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,536
Maybe this will pull him out of it.

112
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,571
Tell Hassan

113
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,697
we have found his brother
and I need to speak to him immediately.

114
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,035
And contact Tim Woods at Homeland.

115
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,413
Have him put together a briefing.
I need to know exactly what we're facing

116
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,082
if, God forbid, this attack happens.

117
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,018
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

118
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,821
- I'll be in the counsel chamber.
- Yes, Madam President.

119
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,677
<i>- Are we alone?</i>
- Yeah. What is it?

120
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,265
I want to let you know
that I've decided

121
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,805
not to pursue charges
against Renee Walker.

122
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:34,810
What?

123
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,771
Why not? I told you...

124
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,935
We have a lot more to worry about
right now than blaming Walker.

125
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:43,626
Walker murdered a valuable lead
that might have gotten us to the rods.

126
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,112
You're not hearing me.

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,630
We have a new lead now,
Farhad Hassan

128
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:49,951
and that is what I am pursuing.

129
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,621
You want to replace me
as head of CTU, be my guest.

130
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,373
<i>But until you do,</i>

131
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,291
stay the hell out of my way.

132
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,224
- You're making...
- I'll let you know

133
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,832
when Bauer reaches Farhad.

134
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,347
Farhad is located on the northeast
corner of the warehouse.

135
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:17,895
We're gonna have to move fast.

136
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,690
King, Lynch, you're gonna
go in from the south.

137
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,063
- Owen and I will cover your flank.
- Understood.

138
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:25,679
As soon as he's locked down,
we're gonna initiate our interrogation.

139
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:28,990
CTU's gonna upload files on suspects.
I need that available and on a computer

140
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,276
as soon as possible.

141
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:33,619
We're getting a call routed through CTU.
It's Farhad Hassan.

142
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,740
Put it on speaker.

143
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:38,249
- <i>This is Jack Bauer. Go ahead.</i>
- How close are you?

144
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,876
Ten minutes out. Are you okay?

145
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:42,181
There's someone here.

146
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:45,684
They're close.

147
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:47,526
They're looking for me.

148
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,028
Please... hurry.

149
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,605
I'm told you have my brother.
What happened?

150
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,731
Please.

151
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:06,819
He called CTU

152
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,529
and surrendered himself.

153
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:12,408
- I don't understand.
- The men that Farhad was working with

154
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,971
turned against him,

155
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,037
and they have taken
the nuclear rods.

156
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,291
He believes they intend to construct
a dirty bomb to attack this city.

157
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,167
Apparently, these men are members

158
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:25,087
of your covert intelligence operations
here in the United States.

159
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:29,550
- I find that hard to believe.
- Your brother has no reason to lie.

160
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,886
By turning himself in,
he's facing the death penalty.

161
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,847
We have to assume
he's telling the truth.

162
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,202
I need for you to give us
intelligence files

163
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:40,519
for every asset
you have in this country

164
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:43,689
so Farhad can identify
these terrorists.

165
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:48,361
Mr. President, I have given you
a great deal of latitude

166
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,748
to sort out your domestic situation,

167
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:55,368
now there is a threat to my homeland,
and I need your cooperation.

168
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,373
I suggest you turn Farhad over to me
and let my people question him.

169
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,871
- We'll get the answers you need.
- There's no time for that.

170
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:05,711
There's a CTU team
moving on Farhad as we speak.

171
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,106
They need to question him on site.
I need the files.

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,176
What you're asking
is a serious breach of our security.

173
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,594
I understand that.

174
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,137
But you need to understand

175
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,800
that if this radiological attack
takes place,

176
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,274
I will be forced to retaliate.

177
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:23,957
You would attack...

178
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,648
my country?

179
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:28,155
I will have no choice.

180
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,109
I need those files...

181
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:36,384
and I need them now.

182
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:45,604
I'll call
my acting head of security.

183
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,671
You'll get the files
in a few minutes.

184
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,149
Thank you.

185
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,667
I want you to know, Tarin,
that I don't believe

186
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,200
you are guilty of treason.

187
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,850
But I have no choice
but to follow orders.

188
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,914
You don't have to explain yourself.

189
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,208
I would do the same thing
in your position.

190
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:28,886
I don't hold any of this
against you.

191
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,301
Whatever happens to me,
you must not blame yourself.

192
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,285
Never forget that.

193
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:38,930
I appreciate that.

194
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:47,565
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

195
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,024
Give me your weapon now.
Slowly, two fingers.

196
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,567
Come on.

197
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:57,968
Driver, pull over here.

198
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,298
Remove your seat belts.
Put your hands on your head.

199
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,874
Get out of the car now.

200
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:17,760
Don't move.
Give me the keys.

201
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,178
Put your hands down.

202
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,076
Don't do this.
You'll make things worse for yourself.

203
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:27,645
You know what they'll do to me.

204
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,021
It can't be any worse.

205
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,737
- It's President Hassan.
- Give it to me.

206
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:43,411
Let's go. In the back.

207
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:47,084
Open it up.

208
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:51,045
Take out your cuffs.
Lock yourselves down.

209
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,237
Nabeel isn't answering.

210
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:03,806
Where is he?

211
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,779
Transporting Tarin to the embassy.

212
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:07,643
Keep trying to reach him.

213
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:11,230
If he doesn't answer,
send a security team to track him.

214
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:13,816
And contact Colonel Al Jhanis.

215
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,446
Tell him on my authority

216
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:17,702
to give CTU access
to the files they requested.

217
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,298
- It's me. Where are you?
- I'm leaving the U.N. right now.

218
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:40,760
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, it worked. Meet me at the hotel.

219
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:43,202
I'll be there in ten minutes.

220
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:46,033
I love you, Kayla.
I'll see you soon.

221
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,911
- <i>Go ahead, Mr. Hastings.</i>
- Farhad, are you there?

222
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:09,559
Yes, yes, I'm here.

223
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,666
<i>Our field team is approaching
the south.</i>

224
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,210
Stay where you are
until they secure the site.

225
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,993
He's almost on me.
I can't stay here.

226
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,711
Do not move
until they lock down that shooter.

227
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,093
Do you understand me?

228
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,630
<i>Farhad, talk to me.</i>

229
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,313
Over here!

230
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:03,551
- Medic! Come on! Medic!
- That's him, that's Farhad.

231
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:07,305
Owen, take your team and sweep the area.
We've got Farhad, but he's been hit.

232
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,725
- I need those files immediately.
- I.R.K. intelligence just sent them.

233
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:22,320
<i>It's done.</i>

234
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,238
Farhad is no longer a problem.

235
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:25,603
Are you sure?

236
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:28,492
I shot him twice but the police arrived,
I had to get out of there.

237
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:31,076
You know where to find us.

238
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,085
Speak to me.

239
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,130
We have two slugs to the abdomen.
I don't think he's going to make it.

240
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:45,007
Do whatever you have to do.
We need to talk to him now. Go!

241
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,555
This is B team.
We found their truck,

242
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,307
but there's no sign of the rods.

243
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,480
Let me know
as soon as these files are uploaded.

244
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,536
I'm going to show you
photos of covert operatives

245
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,538
working for your country
within the USA.

246
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,666
Identify the men
who stole the nuclear rods

247
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,456
from you.
Can you do that for us?

248
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,212
Are those files uploaded yet?

249
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,630
- Almost.
- Come on!

250
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,763
Blood pressure's dropping.
Rapid heartbeat.

251
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:27,385
- What the hell's happening?
- He's going into shock.

252
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,097
- Keep him alive! Do you understand me?
- Let me do my job!

253
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,283
The telepresence conference
is ready.

254
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,408
Thank you.

255
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:51,575
Good to see you.

256
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:55,377
<i>Brian Hastings at CTU
has brought us up to speed,</i>

257
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:57,373
<i>and we're ready
to review some specifics.</i>

258
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,708
I'm listening.

259
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:01,085
If you would refer
to your monitor...

260
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,046
<i>and the diagram
of Midtown Manhattan.</i>

261
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:05,717
<i>According to CTU,</i>

262
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,550
<i>the stolen nuclear rods
have a maximum explosive yield</i>

263
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,429
<i>of 300 pounds.
That's enough radiological material</i>

264
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,643
<i>to contaminate approximately
one square mile.</i>

265
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:15,680
<i>If the device were detonated</i>

266
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:18,416
<i>in a more densely populated area
of Manhattan,</i>

267
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,365
<i>we could be looking at casualties
in the tens of thousands.</i>

268
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,129
<i>Dr. Landry?</i>

269
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,861
<i>Most of the deaths would be
from radiation poisoning.</i>

270
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,572
<i>The remainder would expire
from radiation</i>

271
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,199
<i>induced illnesses.
Primarily leukemia</i>

272
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,577
<i>- and other cancers.
- We also have to consider</i>

273
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,371
<i>that the affected area
would be rendered uninhabitable</i>

274
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,875
<i>- for approximately 40 years.</i>
- Obviously a citywide evacuation

275
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,793
- is out of the question.
<i>- That's right.</i>

276
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,715
<i>Millions of people
are on this island</i>

277
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,089
<i>with few points of egress.
It would take days.</i>

278
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:50,581
<i>Not to mention that going public,
would cause mass panic.</i>

279
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,679
I agree. We need to keep
this threat from the public.

280
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:57,254
Focus on making sure
that this attack never happens.

281
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:00,102
<i>CTU believes the nuclear rods
are still outside the city,</i>

282
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,813
<i>so they're focus
on the bridges and tunnels.</i>

283
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:06,108
<i>We're also hardening
high value targets such as</i>

284
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,819
<i>the financial district,
landmarks, subways.</i>

285
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,405
The U.N. may also be a target.

286
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,991
I think we should evacuate
the entire building.

287
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,369
And resume the conference
from a safe location.

288
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:23,084
All right, inform the delegates
of the situation.

289
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:25,711
Thank you.

290
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,472
CTU has your brother.

291
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:37,932
He's been shot.

292
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:39,951
They're trying to stabilize him.

293
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,736
<i>Agent Rahim is calling for you.</i>

294
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:47,483
<i>- He says he's located Nabeel.</i>
- Put him through.

295
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:52,655
We found Nabeel and his driver
locked down in their vehicle.

296
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:54,579
- <i>Tarin has escaped</i>.
- What?

297
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:57,368
- <i>Nabeel wishes to speak to you</i>.
- Put him on.

298
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,207
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

299
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:06,653
Tarin had a gun.
I don't understand how.

300
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,628
Somebody helped him escape?

301
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,380
It would seem so.

302
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:11,882
But Mr. President,

303
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,098
there's something else
you need to know.

304
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:16,791
Right after he escaped,

305
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,723
I overheard Tarin on the phone.

306
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:22,476
I believe that was
with your daughter.

307
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:29,442
You sure?

308
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,629
It sounded like he was going
to meet her somewhere in the city.

309
00:18:58,112 --> 00:18:59,262
Call me back.

310
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,302
Call me back, Kayla.

311
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:14,104
Come inside.

312
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:21,348
Thank God, you're all right.

313
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:28,626
I contacted a lawyer

314
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:31,003
who's an expert
at international law.

315
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,005
He's agreed to meet us.

316
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,258
This is such a terrible situation.

317
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:37,510
Yet I've never felt so happy.

318
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,230
I feel the same.

319
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:57,245
We did our best.
He didn't make it.

320
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,020
I know you did. Thanks.

321
00:20:00,414 --> 00:20:02,160
The area is clear.
No hostiles.

322
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,242
- No trace of the rods.
- Copy that.

323
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,456
This is Bauer.
Farhad's dead.

324
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,583
Damn it.

325
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:10,142
I think we've got another play.

326
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:13,366
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm
that he was killed.

327
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:14,880
We came up on him too fast.

328
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,967
They don't know how badly
he was wounded.

329
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,878
- What are you proposing?
- We use Farhad as dead bait.

330
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,649
Leak it to the press
that we've got him, and he survived.

331
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:25,277
We're bring him to a hospital
where police will question him.

332
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,899
They'll have to make a move on him.
He knows too much.

333
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:30,277
- Sounds like a Hail Mary.
- Now it's the only play.

334
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:33,899
But if they make a move on Farhad,
we'll be waiting for them.

335
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:37,739
You said you wanted me in
till this was resolved. This is it.

336
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,598
We've his intelligence files.

337
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:42,321
We can scan and cross-reference
with facial recognition.

338
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:44,716
Maybe spot the terrorists
before they attack.

339
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,708
All right, Jack.

340
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:50,499
It's not procedure ferrying
a dead man's body across the city,

341
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,493
<i>but do it.</i>

342
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,129
We'll figure out a hospital route
and put a press statement.

343
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,726
- <i>You get ready on your end</i>.
- Thank you.

344
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:00,676
Get that body ready for transport.
Owen, assemble your men.

345
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,136
Briefing in less than five.

346
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:13,000
Aerial one is in position
over the route.

347
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:15,942
Sniper teams have checked in.
They're all in place.

348
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,077
Come on.

349
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:32,904
Let's go.

350
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:13,809
It's over.

351
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,472
Let's get the other
and get cleaned up

352
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,447
before we head back to CTU.

353
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,853
Cole, what about us?

354
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:32,627
I don't know.

355
00:22:41,832 --> 00:22:44,155
<i>We've received word
from New York CTU</i>

356
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:46,623
<i>that Farhad Hassan</i>

357
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,827
<i>brother of Islamic Republic
of Kamistan President Hassan</i>

358
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,120
<i>has been found alive.</i>

359
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:53,748
<i>We're told that he</i>

360
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:55,124
<i>contacted CTU</i>

361
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,987
<i>a short while ago
and agreed to turn...</i>

362
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:58,294
Farhad is alive.

363
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,729
- What?
- <i>CTU responded immediately,</i>

364
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:02,798
<i>but when they arrived,
they found him shot.</i>

365
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,719
<i>No word yet
on how Farhad Hassan has been shot,</i>

366
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:09,430
<i>but we do know
that he's expected to survive,</i>

367
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:12,775
<i>and he's being transported
to St. Julian's Hospital</i>

368
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,686
<i>under heightened security
where he'll be questioned.</i>

369
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:17,813
This is impossible.

370
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:19,190
{\Farhad Hassan has been on the
run since early this evening...}

371
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:21,024
I shot him twice.

372
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,319
But you didn't make sure
he was dead.

373
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,196
I didn't have time.

374
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,075
I'll make this right.

375
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:32,501
- I'll go back.
- You're too conspicuous.

376
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,374
- He will be heavily protected.
- If he talks,

377
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,460
the authorities could find us
before we can build the weapon.

378
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,965
We know the implications.

379
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,927
We're sending Marcos.

380
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,015
His mother's American.

381
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,472
They won't suspect him.

382
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:53,724
He's in the truck

383
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,001
with the rods.

384
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,958
Mom, it's me.

385
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,006
- <i>Listen, I can't talk for long</i>.
- What is it? Are you okay?

386
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,174
I'm fine.

387
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:30,344
I need you to do something for me.
It's very important.

388
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:33,848
What is it?

389
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:37,602
Get up right now and leave the city.

390
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,930
- Go to Aunt Shelley's.
- Aunt Shelley's?

391
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:42,371
Just do it for me, okay?
Don't ask me why.

392
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,139
Leave right now.

393
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,111
This is crazy...

394
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,281
I'm not gonna leave in the middle
of the night for no reason.

395
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,159
There's a reason.
I can't tell you what it is right now.

396
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:56,306
- Please, Mom, do this for me.
- Where are you?

397
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:58,766
Don't worry about me.

398
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,923
I'm not going anywhere
unless I know you're all right.

399
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:04,462
Meet me at Aunt Shelley's
and I'll explain everything.

400
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,599
Go Mom, now.

401
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:10,968
I'm leaving.

402
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,596
I have to go. I love you.

403
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:25,775
Are you ready, my friend?

404
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:29,642
Good.

405
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:30,923
It's time.

406
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:37,507
You need to keep him
looking alive the entire way.

407
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,792
- You know what to do?
- Yes, sir.

408
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,457
<i>- It's Hastings.</i>
- Go ahead.

409
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,292
We've coordinated with news outlets.

410
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,486
They put out the false report
of his arrest

411
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,630
and transport to the hospital
for questioning.

412
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,507
The hook has been baited.

413
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,301
The logical place for them to attack
is when we're en route.

414
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,844
We're gonna be vulnerable.

415
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,138
NYPD and SWAT are mobilizing now.

416
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,447
They're going to be embedded
at strategic points along the way.

417
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:01,716
They're also securing
St. Julian's Hospital.

418
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,248
Tell the support teams it is imperative
that we take these terrorists alive.

419
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:06,565
They've been briefed.

420
00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:08,888
We're moving out.
Take the follow van.

421
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:11,403
- Owen, with me in the ambulance.
- Copy that.

422
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,351
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:19,985
I know you and your men have not had
a lot of field experience

424
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,998
and we've put you
in an extreme situation.

425
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:25,835
But I promise you, if we're attacked,
every part of this route is covered.

426
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:27,753
We've got a lot of support.

427
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:31,257
I'm fine, Mr. Bauer.
Let's do this.

428
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:06,415
Our delegation is preparing to head
to McGuire Air force Base.

429
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,336
We'll be setting up
a temporary ops center,

430
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,495
where we'll be able
to monitor the situation.

431
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,816
The other delegates?

432
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:15,599
U.N. Security will coordinate
the evacuation. It should go smoothly.

433
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,683
Can I get you anything?

434
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:23,643
Thank you, Rob.
You have done more than enough.

435
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:28,032
I'm sorry that your first few months
on the job have been so challenging.

436
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:30,524
I wouldn't have had it
any other way.

437
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,365
I'll see you in a moment.

438
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,788
I spoke to one of my aides.

439
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,290
He told me my brother is... dead.

440
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:48,501
I'm afraid so.

441
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:51,204
When CTU is finished
with their operation,

442
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,594
I would like Farhad's remains
to be returned to my country.

443
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,609
I don't care where his body rots,

444
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:00,429
but my mother
will want a proper burial.

445
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,515
I'll see that it's done.

446
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,409
But right now, Mr. President,
we need to evacuate the U.N.

447
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,312
I'm not leaving,

448
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,329
Madam President.
I'm staying here.

449
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:11,857
I don't understand.

450
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,109
My daughter Kayla...

451
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:15,607
is missing.

452
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:17,982
Missing?

453
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:22,118
Kayla is romantically involved
with my former head of security.

454
00:28:22,592 --> 00:28:24,036
She's run off with him.

455
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:27,039
- Tell me what we can do to help.
- I appreciate that,

456
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,834
but my security teams
are searching for her now.

457
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:33,129
I understand
how worried you must be,

458
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,341
but there is nothing that you can do
to help her by staying here.

459
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,616
Please come where you'll be safe.

460
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:41,095
I can't, Madam President.

461
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:43,112
She's somewhere in the city,

462
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,842
with no idea
that a nuclear threat exists.

463
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:48,537
I won't go anywhere

464
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:52,607
All right.

465
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:56,418
I understand.

466
00:28:57,865 --> 00:28:59,815
I will talk to you very soon.

467
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:01,157
Thank you.

468
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,545
They're turning west on Sixth Street.
Pulling into the hospital.

469
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,321
Bring up the hospital security feed.

470
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:42,891
Get facial recognition
up and running.

471
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,112
This is Bauer.
We're moving into position.

472
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:53,688
Farhad's body's being taken
to his room.

473
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:56,823
Let's go!

474
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:01,572
Secure these doors!

475
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,115
Bring up the exterior cameras.

476
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,626
This is Bauer.

477
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:18,349
Jack, it's me.

478
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:21,547
I've been released.

479
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:26,071
Chloe told me what you did.
You leveraged Hastings.

480
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:29,138
Said that you would head up field ops
until this crisis was over

481
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,906
in exchange for CTU dropping
any possible

482
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:33,637
charges against me.

483
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,563
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- I know you didn't.

484
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,927
Someone is trying to set you up

485
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:42,193
to take responsibility
for the failure of our mission

486
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:44,293
and I couldn't let that happen

487
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,405
because you did nothing wrong.

488
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,599
You understand me?
Renee, you need to let this go.

489
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,142
<i>You're not responsible
for what's happening.</i>

490
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,328
I meant what I said earlier.

491
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,545
When this is over,
I want to be there for you...

492
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:04,382
with you.

493
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,052
I'd like that.

494
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,891
<i>Good. I'll have a CTU agent
take you to my apartment.</i>

495
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,998
<i>I'll meet you there
when this is over.</i>

496
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:14,563
All right, Jack.

497
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:18,187
I'm getting chatter over the comm.
I gotta go.

498
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:23,703
Go ahead.

499
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,155
Facial recognition just picked up
a match with the intelligence files.

500
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:31,237
His name's Marcos Al-Zacar.
American-born.

501
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:34,130
Working undercover with the I.R.K.
for the last three years.

502
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:36,247
- Where is he?
- <i>Next to the side entrance.</i>

503
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:38,676
Brown hair, blue scrubs,
wearing a dark-blue jacket.

504
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:39,799
Copy that.

505
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,227
Hold on, Jack.
He's got something in his hand.

506
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:43,629
Like a remote detonator.

507
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,464
I think he's wearing a vest.

508
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:48,759
Can you disarm it from there?

509
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:51,169
Possibly,
if I can pin down the detonator model,

510
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:54,515
I can scramble the arming code using
the transmitter in the mobile comm.

511
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,362
Get on it. Owen, you've got a man
approaching your position.

512
00:32:57,487 --> 00:33:00,647
<i>Brown hair. He's wearing blue scrubs
and a dark-blue jacket.</i>

513
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,104
- I see him.
- He's our hitter.

514
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:06,687
We believe he's wearing
an explosive vest with a detonator.

515
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:07,862
What should I do?

516
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,822
Stay calm and do whatever he asks.

517
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,034
CTU techs are going to try
and disarm the vest from offsite.

518
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:18,439
You can do this.

519
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:21,217
Just try and slow him down
as much as possible.

520
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:23,093
We've got you covered.

521
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:24,218
Yes, sir.

522
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:31,802
Excuse me. This is a secure area.

523
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,220
I'll need to see some I.D.

524
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:40,476
Listen to me very carefully.
I have a bomb.

525
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:44,565
Give me your weapon right now,
or I'll kill us both.

526
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:48,569
Your weapon now.

527
00:33:50,968 --> 00:33:52,278
Just take it easy.

528
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:53,403
Slowly.

529
00:34:03,844 --> 00:34:05,294
Where is Farhad Hassan?

530
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:06,712
Third floor.

531
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,517
Take me to him.

532
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,348
Anyone asks who I am,
you say I'm a doctor, and I'm cleared.

533
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:12,468
Come on, son.

534
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:15,408
Move.

535
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:17,775
Go.

536
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:46,961
It's me.

537
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,089
- <i>We need to talk.</i>
- Don't try to change my mind, Omar.

538
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,234
I told you, I'm leaving.

539
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:54,093
I haven't called
to change your mind.

540
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,615
I called because...

541
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:57,611
Kayla may be in danger.

542
00:34:58,283 --> 00:34:59,403
What do you mean?

543
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:01,392
She's run away with Tarin.

544
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:03,978
- They've been seeing each other.
- I know.

545
00:35:06,616 --> 00:35:09,525
- How long have you known?
- What difference does it make, Omar?

546
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,152
What kind of danger?

547
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:12,945
Farhad is dead.

548
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,061
The nuclear material
he tried to acquire

549
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:16,987
is in the hands of the terrorists.

550
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,821
They're going to use it
here in Manhattan.

551
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,707
- How did this happen?
- I'll explain later.

552
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,792
But right now
you need to call Kayla.

553
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,007
I've left messages,
she won't return my calls.

554
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:30,504
But she might talk to you.

555
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:32,824
Please, Dalia.

556
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:34,887
She's angry at me.

557
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,304
I had Tarin arrested.
I thought he was part of the conspiracy.

558
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:41,043
All right.

559
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:44,310
But what about you?

560
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:46,108
Don't worry about me.

561
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:48,064
Just help me find our daughter.

562
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:49,797
I'll try.

563
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,839
Sabira, I need the captain.

564
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,865
We're moving to the third floor.
Where are we at with the vest?

565
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:43,719
I've identified the detonator, Jack.
It's German-made, K7 variant,

566
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:46,245
but that model is used
in a lot of configurations.

567
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,387
I'm going to need
a visual on the vest.

568
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,376
Copy that.
Owen, it's Jack.

569
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:52,922
CTU cannot disarm the vest
unless they see it.

570
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,466
Get the hostile
underneath a surveillance camera,

571
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,799
and make him show it.

572
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:00,177
I repeat, CTU cannot disarm the vest
unless they see it.

573
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,661
You ready?

574
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,706
<i>Team three,
they're approaching your position.</i>

575
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:32,710
What are you doing?

576
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:34,921
I want to see proof.

577
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,715
- Proof of what?
- A bomb.

578
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,507
I don't believe you have one.

579
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:44,347
You don't keep moving,
you're gonna find out.

580
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:48,609
Right now.

581
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:51,707
You want Farhad,

582
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:53,676
you show me.

583
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:57,068
I said "Move."

584
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:15,628
Owen did it.
I've got a visual on the vest.

585
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:17,421
Now, move.

586
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,680
We're set in position
near Farhad's room. What's the status?

587
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:29,642
It's a DDR configuration.
I need to pull up the frequency.

588
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,561
You've got about 30 seconds
before they reach that room.

589
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,601
Got it.
3.15 gigahertz, standard GSM.

590
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:43,698
Running it through the mobile comm now.
This'll take a few seconds.

591
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:48,327
Stand by for assault.

592
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:56,922
On the floor, face down!
Do it now!

593
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,671
Don't move!

594
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,172
Come on, Arlo.

595
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,274
Now.

596
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,606
That's it. It's done.

597
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:18,566
Jack, the vest is disarmed.

598
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:19,734
Move in.

599
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:51,766
All right.

600
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,769
Lower your weapons.
It's all right.

601
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,695
I'm going to put my gun away.

602
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,168
We're not here to hurt you.

603
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:00,858
We just want to talk.

604
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:02,985
Stay calm.

605
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,196
It's all right.

606
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:08,616
I just want to talk to you.

607
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:24,347
He's still moving.
Notify the perimeter.

608
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:32,707
Do not fire!

609
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,150
He's unarmed!

610
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,922
This is Bauer.
I'm in the east wing.

611
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:33,047
Suspect has barricaded himself
in some kind of pressure chamber.

612
00:41:33,172 --> 00:41:35,415
I need a team down here
to help me open the door.

613
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:50,426
<i>It was a trap.</i>

614
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:51,928
Farhad was already dead.

615
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:54,069
- What?
- The police were waiting.

616
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:55,890
They tried to ambush me,
but I got away.

617
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,423
Where are you?

618
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,519
I locked myself inside
an oxygen chamber. They can't get me.

619
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,037
<i>At least not yet.</i>

620
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,648
You know what you must do.

621
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:05,047
I can't.

622
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:07,734
I think
they scrambled the arming code.

623
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:10,154
You need to set it off manually.

624
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:12,484
- I don't know how.
- I'll talk you through it.

625
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:14,419
Can you open the detonator control?

626
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:16,694
I think so.

627
00:42:18,374 --> 00:42:20,929
- It's going to take a minute.
- Work quickly.

628
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:24,293
You cannot let them take you alive.

629
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:30,109
