1
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,009
As we gather together

2
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,997
for this great occasion,

3
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,708
we must not forget

4
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,059
that we all stand in the shadow

5
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:24,065
of Omar Hassan's tragic death.

6
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:26,609
But...

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,460
the peace agreement
we're about to sign

8
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:31,678
will be his living memorial.

9
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:35,760
His courage brought us all
to this historic day,

10
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,528
and his vision

11
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:41,376
will continue to guide us
as we move into the future...

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,765
together.

13
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:46,170
So on behalf
of the people of Russia,

14
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:50,174
I extend the open hand of friendship
to my partners in peace:

15
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:52,051
President Taylor,

16
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,803
President Hassan.

17
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,055
Thank you.

18
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,245
There'll be time for questions
after the signing ceremony. Please.

19
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,524
If there's nothing more,
I will see you both at the signing.

20
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,075
It appears I am not the only one
who does not want to be here.

21
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,075
Mrs. Hassan is distraught.

22
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:21,622
Understandably...
Her husband was killed six hours ago.

23
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:24,083
Is that why she refuses
to look at me?

24
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,045
She knows.

25
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:33,776
A reporter told her
of your complicity

26
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,302
in her husband's murder.

27
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,002
Dalia came to me.

28
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:41,225
And you confirmed
this journalist's allegations.

29
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:43,205
I told her the truth.

30
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,981
And yet, knowing what she knows,
she's still here.

31
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,777
Mrs. Hassan understands
the benefits of peace.

32
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,581
Because you helped her
come to that understanding.

33
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,340
Excuse me, Madam President.

34
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,701
Whatever it was you said
to Mrs. Hassan to keep her here

35
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,961
must have been very convincing.

36
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,962
Take your call, Yuri.

37
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:35,404
We need to talk.

38
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,323
So talk.

39
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,216
It's a sensitive matter,
something that...

40
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:43,120
- that can't be discussed on the phone.
- All right.

41
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:46,108
- <i>Come to my suite.</i>
- <i>No. You need to come to mine.</i>

42
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,233
<i>Why?</i>

43
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,220
<i>Just trust me, Yuri.</i>

44
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,629
<i>Trust you?</i>

45
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,983
I don't need to remind you
that it is in our mutual self-interest

46
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,393
to make sure that certain
secrets stay secret.

47
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:00,268
Stop talking in riddles, Charles.

48
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,306
I don't have time for this.

49
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,391
There's a possible leak
inside of your camp,

50
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,849
<i>which is why we need
to discuss this in my office.</i>

51
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:10,986
I'll be right there.

52
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,038
<i>I hope
I was convincing enough for you.</i>

53
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:23,472
You're a world-class liar;
I would have expected nothing else.

54
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:28,506
What exactly do you think you're doing
by killing Suvarov?

55
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,511
<i>Getting justice for Renee Walker?</i>

56
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,742
Yes, and for the people that died today
trying to protect this country.

57
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,386
Now, sit at the desk
and keep the line open.

58
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:44,035
The audio file you recorded...
We can use it to expose Suvarov.

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,684
We can use the CTU servers
to distribute it to every agency

60
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,995
and media outlet.

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,230
Taylor's already censored the press.
NSA's putting up firewalls.

62
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:54,608
Arlo's working on getting through them.
The President can't lock down

63
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,226
every media outlet.

64
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,963
That's Cole.

65
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,531
If I don't answer that,
he's sending a TAC team in here.

66
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:03,868
It'll be too late.
I'm gonna finish what I've started.

67
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,008
<i>You've reached
Chloe O'Brian's voicemail. Please...</i>

68
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:23,387
- Delta groups, this is base. Come in.
- This is Delta One. Go ahead.

69
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,649
I need you to deploy all TAC units
to the 22nd floor of the Hart Building.

70
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:29,518
- I have intel on a possible sniper.
- You got I.D. on this hostile?

71
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,438
Affirmative.
It's Jack Bauer.

72
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,922
With regard to Bauer, sir,

73
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,943
the standing order
is to use lethal force.

74
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,497
- The order stands.
- Copy that. We're on our way.

75
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:44,863
Delta teams two and three,
this is a priority mobilization.

76
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,471
The suspect is Jack Bauer.
Considered armed and dangerous.

77
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,622
Maintain shoot-on-sight protocol.

78
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:00,299
Listen to me, Jack. Please.

79
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,385
Put down your rifle,
and let me walk you out of here

80
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,837
before they get here.

81
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,553
Killing Pavel and Novakovich
was one thing, but killing Suvarov?

82
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,991
The Russians will consider
an assassination of their president

83
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,562
on American soil an act of war.

84
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:16,148
He facilitated a terrorist attack
against this country.

85
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,682
That's an act of war.
He's a murderer.

86
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:21,051
You're provoking a war
with a nuclear-armed country.

87
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,656
- Shut up, Chloe!
- Or what? You're gonna kill me, too?

88
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:30,162
They need to be held accountable.
They brought this on themselves.

89
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,873
I don't need to remind you
of the collateral damage.

90
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,501
Not to mention the innocent lives
that are at stake.

91
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,321
<i>Sir, President Suvarov is outside.</i>

92
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:43,968
<i>He says you're expecting him.</i>

93
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:52,626
Excuse me, sir?

94
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,165
I heard you.

95
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,942
Send him in.

96
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,778
You're gonna start a war
because you lost someone?

97
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,321
This isn't about me.

98
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:06,657
Renee wouldn't want you to do this.

99
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,159
- I said shut up, Chloe!
- You know she wouldn't.

100
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:12,830
She would want you
to use that data card to get justice.

101
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,833
The last thing Renee would want
is for you to start a war in her name.

102
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,763
Don't dishonor her memory like this.

103
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,967
- <i>We should speak alone.</i>
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>

104
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:39,273
This person, the one you say
is leaking information...

105
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,608
who is it?

106
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:47,807
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

107
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:57,056
Okay, we'll do it your way.
Promise me you'll see this through.

108
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:58,959
I'm not getting out
of this building alive.

109
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,942
You got to promise me
that you will see this through

110
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,381
and that you will do
exactly what I say.

111
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,919
I need to hear it!

112
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,267
I promise.

113
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:14,425
I'm...

114
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,138
I'm sorry...

115
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,115
for calling you so urgently.
I was, mistaken.

116
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,693
My concern appeared
to have been unfounded.

117
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:28,588
I got a call from my source
just a moment ago.

118
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,784
His information was wrong.

119
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:35,364
I'm so sorry
for wasting your time, Yuri.

120
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,748


121
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,424
See you after the signing.

122
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:54,825
Find Pillar.

123
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,852
Sweeping equipment 22nd floor!

124
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,870
The TAC team's almost here.

125
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,026
I need to make it to mobile command.

126
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:09,822
You won't even get that far,
and make it out of here.

127
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:12,199
You found me first
by circumventing CTU.

128
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:15,410
If Logan hasn't figured that out yet,
he will soon enough.

129
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,788
CTU gave you a standing order
with regards to me,

130
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,541
to terminate with extreme prejudice.
If you don't shoot me,

131
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,128
that file's not going anywhere.
Take your weapon. Take it!

132
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,672
And point it at me.
Point it!

133
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,923
When they come,

134
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,050
tell them I've got the rifle,
I turned on you,

135
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,553
- and you opened fire.
- I can't do that.

136
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,748
Dammit, Chloe, pull the trigger!

137
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:37,432
We are running out of time.
They are gonna find us soon.

138
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,726
You said
that you would follow this through.

139
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,187
- Pull the trigger!
- I can't!

140
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,530
Yes and you will!
Now, pull the trigger!

141
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,526
Damn you, pull the trigger!

142
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,819
We are running out of time!

143
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,612
Please don't make me do this.

144
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,532
If you care about me at all,
you will pull the trigger.

145
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,367
- Do it!
- I can't.

146
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,078
- Pull the trigger!
- I'm not gonna do it!

147
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,455
Damn you!

148
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:05,460
What happened?

149
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,837
I shot him first.

150
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,673
Jack Bauer's down with a wound
to the upper chest.

151
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,541
I repeat, Bauer is down.

152
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,819
Burke's reporting

153
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,571
- <i>you shot Jack.</i>
- I had to.

154
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,919
- I'm on my way there right now.
- I need you at mobile command.

155
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,592
What's happened?

156
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:40,495
Jack gave me the recording
of Logan and Suvarov's conversation.

157
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,837
So, why did you shoot him?

158
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,458
<i>I'll explain later.</i>

159
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,752
Make sure
that Arlo is ready to upload that file.

160
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,343


161
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:53,604
- What's Jack's status?
- EMT are working on him right now.

162
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:55,553
- Is he going to make it?
- I don't know.

163
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,388
I'll explain to you when I get there.
I'll see you soon.

164
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,269


165
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:18,200
NYPD found Mr. Pillar in the garage.

166
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:19,826
In the back of his SUV.

167
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,912
- He wants me to hold you here.
- Why?

168
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,007
He's been apprised of the situation,
and he wants to debrief you.

169
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,084
We can do it later.
I'm still running security.

170
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,089
- Ms. O'Brian, he was adamant.
- I've got to get back to the mobile.

171
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,470
His authority,
comes from the President.

172
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,844
If you want to call
to the White House, we can do that.

173
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,975
- When will he be here?
- He's on his way up here now.

174
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,087
I'm sure it was a terrible ordeal.

175
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:22,014
But they told me Bauer's down.

176
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,832
- It's over.
- No. No.

177
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:25,851
It's not over, Jason.

178
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:30,021
Bauer has a recording
that implicates me along with Suvarov.

179
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:31,231
How do you know?

180
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:33,900
Because the son of a bitch
played the thing for me.

181
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:37,362
<i>He must've put a bug on me
when he attacked the car.</i>

182
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:41,221
For all I know, he has recorded
every conversation I've had

183
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:42,576
for the past two hours.

184
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:44,286
I'm on site now.

185
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,109
<i>I'll recover whatever he's got.</i>

186
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:49,964
You're on the line here, too.

187
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,002
If this evidence gets out,

188
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:56,310
- we all go down together.
- I understand what's at stake.

189
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:58,383
I'll call you back soon.

190
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,079
- Is he stable?
- Yes, sir.

191
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,383
As you requested, I searched Bauer.

192
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:12,109
We're still combing the site,
but that's what we found so far.

193
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:20,621
- There's nothing else?
- We're still sweeping.

194
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:22,199
I believe this phone is yours.

195
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:31,708
It's a...

196
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,002
digital recorder,
but there's nothing in it.

197
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,339
Come.

198
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,967
Excuse us.

199
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,032
The data card is missing.
Bauer has a digital file

200
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,015
that poses a threat
to national security.

201
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,101
- We need to find it.
- We'll keep looking.

202
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,026
What happened?

203
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,279
He drew his gun and I shot him.
That's all.

204
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,031
Bauer give you anything?

205
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,075
Like what?

206
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,619
He had a digital recorder.
The data card's missing.

207
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,705
- I thought you might know where it is.
- I don't know.

208
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:13,805
You didn't see him
stash it anywhere?

209
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:17,087
If I did, I would've taken it
and already logged it

210
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,355
as evidence.

211
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,841
Then you don't mind
emptying your pockets.

212
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,720
- I just shot my friend, so...
- Unless you want me

213
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,181
to do it for you, I need you
to empty your pockets now.

214
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,100
On what grounds?

215
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,393
National security.

216
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,187
Let's go.

217
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,164
If I search you,
will I find that data card?

218
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:54,291
This is ridiculous.

219
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,001
Put your hands up here.

220
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:04,832
I just told you, I shot Jack.
Why would I be helping him?

221
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:07,957
Sorry, Ms. O'Brian,
I have to be absolutely sure.

222
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:29,304
Okay.

223
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:31,558
Hope you enjoyed yourself.

224
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:12,771
It's over, Jack.

225
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,913
You need to talk to me,
maybe do yourself some good.

226
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:17,374
Where's the data card?

227
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:24,133
Is he stable enough to be treated
at CTU instead of the hospital?

228
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,626
He should be. He got lucky.
It's a through and through.

229
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,419
Through and through?

230
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,762
Bullet didn't hit any
of his organs or his arteries.

231
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,138
If you're gonna get shot,
that's where you want to happen.

232
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:36,564
Son of a bitch!
Get me mobile command.

233
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,563
What?

234
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,690
You got something to say to me?

235
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:44,792
Just tell me what you got to say.
Talk to me.

236
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,323
What?

237
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:59,283
Get him out of here!

238
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,050
Lock down O'Brian!

239
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,803
Arlo's ready to receive the file.

240
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:12,159
- Tell me why you shot Jack.
- They'd suspect me if I didn't.

241
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:14,389
My only way out
with the evidence was to shoot him.

242
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,391
Medical report said
it went clean through.

243
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,561
That no vital organs were hit.
You meant to miss them?

244
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:23,498
How did you know
you wouldn't kill him?

245
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,400
I didn't.
It's uploading now.

246
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,235
It shouldn't take long.

247
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,323
I just need a few more seconds.

248
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,398
- What's going on?
- We have to lock her down.

249
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,881
- What orders?
- Step aside.

250
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:36,412
Tell me what's going on first.

251
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,954
We won't ask again.
Step aside.

252
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,418
Don't... I order you... stop!
I'm ordering you to stop!

253
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:44,458
Don't!

254
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:48,795
- Is this the data that Bauer gave you?
- You need to listen to what's on it.

255
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,902
- Mr. Pillar'll make that decision.
- Pillar is part of the cover-up.

256
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:54,034
That data card will never
make it to evidence.

257
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,515
- Hold them here.
- Don't do this!

258
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,981
Burke, stop what you're doing!

259
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,937
Think about what you're doing,
Burke, stop!

260
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,622
I locked down O'Brian.

261
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:13,578
Looks like she was working
with Agent Ortiz. He's in custody, too.

262
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:14,890
Get the data card?

263
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,295
Yes, sir.

264
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,688
O'Brian was trying
to upload the file at CTU,

265
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:20,394
but I stopped the transmission.

266
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,541
Good work.

267
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,461
All right, send O'Brian and Ortiz
to CTU lockdown and talk to no one.

268
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,678
Get that data card
to President Logan.

269
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:29,803
Yes, sir.

270
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,685
Take them to CTU.

271
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:51,277
This is it.

272
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,200
This is the recording
that Jack Bauer made.

273
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,612
Bauer was working with Chloe O'Brian
and a field agent called Cole Ortiz.

274
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:06,334
They were planning to use CTU's servers
to disseminate this recording

275
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,696
to news organizations,
and government officials

276
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:12,630
and watchdog groups
on a massive scale.

277
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:14,105
It almost worked.

278
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:17,095
My people, they never gave up,
and now it's over.

279
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,263
You won.

280
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,816
Congratulations.

281
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:27,480
- Have you listened to this?
- Yes, but it's not worth hearing.

282
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,176
Where is Jack now?

283
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:34,786
He's about to be transported
to CTU under heavy guard.

284
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:39,534
I realize that this
is a difficult area,

285
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,756
but the one thing
we can be certain of

286
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:44,414
is that Jack Bauer will never

287
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,682
let this go.

288
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:50,643
I don't suppose he will.

289
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:55,637
All great achievements in state...

290
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:00,048
are fragile things, Madam President.

291
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,700
Especially in their infancy.

292
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:05,303
They need to be protected.

293
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,320
Our peace agreement...
very vulnerable.

294
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,580
As long as Jack Bauer is out there,

295
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:13,955
the agreement will never be safe.

296
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,130
Then we will lock him away

297
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,885
in a black site halfway
around the world.

298
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,030
He will find a way, Madam President.

299
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:23,932
Mark my words.

300
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:27,669
He will rise out
of the deepest hole in the ground.

301
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:31,628
He will claw his way back
from the ends of the Earth,

302
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,636
unless we stop him

303
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:37,005
before that can happen.

304
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:46,236
Pending approval,
I have taken upon myself to...

305
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:49,437
put a plan in motion.

306
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:52,609
Of course you have.

307
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:00,532
I will take your silence

308
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,100
as tacit approval.

309
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,499
<i>A lot of good people died today,</i>

310
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:34,185
<i>not just President Hassan.</i>

311
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,662
<i>Operatives from CTU, members
of other law enforcement agencies.</i>

312
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,479
<i>Who I was very close to.</i>

313
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,289
<i>These people died today
because President Suvarov</i>

314
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:55,090
<i>wanted to destroy the peace treaty
for his own interests,</i>

315
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,324
<i>and President Taylor knows this
because I told her,</i>

316
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:59,537
<i>but she's willing to cover it up
because she believes</i>

317
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:01,634
<i>the peace accord will serve
the greater good.</i>

318
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,386
<i>She is wrong, it won't.</i>

319
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,517
Both delegations are here.

320
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,104
What about the secretary general?

321
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:15,189
He's just outside in the atrium.

322
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,376
Thank you, Tim.

323
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,477
<i>Lasting peace...
cannot simply be political.</i>

324
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,526
<i>It has to be born out of trust
and honesty and understanding</i>

325
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:38,201
<i>and most importantly,
a will on both sides to move forward.</i>

326
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:42,704
<i>Currently, that will does not exist.</i>

327
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:46,012
<i>This peace is fraudulent,
and I cannot in good conscience</i>

328
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,515
<i>allow the people that lost
their lives today to go unspoken for.</i>

329
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:53,381
<i>You reminded me
of that earlier today.</i>

330
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:54,933
<i>That's who I am.</i>

331
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:18,849
Bauer is being handled.

332
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:20,042
Is it done?

333
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,467
All right, then.

334
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:28,518
You know, I wasn't sure

335
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:30,885
the President had the balls
to see this through.

336
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:33,345
Clearly, I underestimated her.

337
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,811
We both did, sir.

338
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:42,807
Good luck, Madam President.

339
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:09,550
This calls for a celebration.

340
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:11,431
A little something
to numb that ear pain?

341
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:14,637
What are you drinking?

342
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:16,185
Whatever you're having.

343
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:22,233
You did well, Jason.

344
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,161
You kept your eye on the prize.

345
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,157
Thank you, sir.

346
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,191
Here's to...

347
00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:33,018
all the political capital

348
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:35,038
the President is about to bank

349
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,256
downstairs.

350
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:39,527
And here's to helping her spend it.

351
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:53,401
I keep having to remind myself
that we will be home tomorrow,

352
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:55,626
and this day will be behind us.

353
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,586
Ladies and gentlemen, please,

354
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,590
please take your seats.

355
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,384
Honored delegates

356
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:32,577
and distinguished guests,

357
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,140
on behalf of the United Nations,
please allow me

358
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:40,520
to welcome you to this great occasion
of hope and peace.

359
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:44,524
Today, we bear witness
to an extraordinary act

360
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,142
in one of the world's
defining dramas.

361
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,947
If you would allow me now
to offer private words to those of us

362
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,291
that are fortunate enough
to be here now.

363
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:55,868
May we all pledge

364
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:59,622
to make the spirit of this moment.

365
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:02,844
A new chapter...

366
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,669
in the history of all nations.

367
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:10,007
The President of the USA,

368
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:11,932
please, would you join me?

369
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:16,274
The President
of the Russian Federation

370
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:20,393
and the President
of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan,

371
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,119
would you please join me?

372
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,662
Before you... is the final draft

373
00:25:39,983 --> 00:25:41,981
of the agreement
that has been negotiated

374
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,956
by you and your representatives
in good faith.

375
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,810
By signing its pages, you commit

376
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:50,381
your respective countries
to abide by the terms

377
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,222
set forth therein, as stipulated

378
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,978
by international law.

379
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:01,543
I believe you are to go first.

380
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,879
Your husband wanted me to have this.

381
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,010
I cannot accept it.

382
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,914
What are you doing?

383
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,624
What I should have done hours ago.

384
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:34,128
I urge you to stop
what you are about to do.

385
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,686
Mr. Secretary General,

386
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:41,510
my fellow delegates.

387
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:46,682
Grave crimes have been committed
in the run-up to this treaty.

388
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,519
I have participated

389
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,063
in a conspiracy

390
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,414
to hide those crimes.

391
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,274
Before there can be
a meaningful peace,

392
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,869
justice must be served.

393
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:07,870
I will be...

394
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,374
giving a more complete statement
within the hour,

395
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,642
but for now,

396
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:16,362
this peace process has come
to an end.

397
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:35,376
Contact CTU and have them alert
Jack Bauer's medical transport.

398
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,579
He is about to be ambushed.

399
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:42,193
Just make the call, Tim!
We may already be too late.

400
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,829
Dispatch, this is Tim Woods.
I have an emergency.

401
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,693
The convoy transporting Jack Bauer
is about to be ambushed.

402
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:54,943
Alert Medical One immediately.

403
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:56,897
Do it.

404
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,426
Madam President, talk to me.

405
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,178
Tell me what's happening.

406
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:12,560
I have made a terrible mistake, Tim,

407
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,461
one that I can never undo...

408
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,941
but I need you to help me stop it

409
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,609
from becoming worse.

410
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:46,801
This is Woods.

411
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:52,735
Thank you.

412
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:57,769
We didn't make it.

413
00:30:58,595 --> 00:30:59,845
They got Bauer.

414
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,993
My statement is brief,
and I will take no questions.

415
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:13,746
Moments ago,

416
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,457
President Taylor declined to sign

417
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,614
<i>the peace accord and excused herself
from the proceedings.</i>

418
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:23,881
<i>She did so after making allegations
of crimes which she did not specify,</i>

419
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:26,675
<i>and which the United Nations
has no knowledge of.</i>

420
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,462
<i>President Taylor
will come forward within the hour</i>

421
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:34,225
<i>to explain
the reasons for her actions.</i>

422
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:37,865
<i>Until then, please,
direct all queries</i>

423
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,066
<i>to the White House
Communications Office.</i>

424
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:51,742
That's the President
asking about Bauer.

425
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:02,671
Let it ring.

426
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,048
With due respect, sir,
what good will it do?

427
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:08,949
It's over.

428
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,097
Let's not add murder to the list
of charges already against us.

429
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:24,858
You know what?
You're right.

430
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,946
Go ahead. Pick it up.

431
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,193
This is President Taylor.
I need to speak to Logan immediately.

432
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:47,498
This was my last chance,

433
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:49,273
and Bauer took it away.

434
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,226
It's come to this because of him.

435
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:08,444
It's locked.

436
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:13,449
- Open the door, Charles!
- This is Tim Woods.

437
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:14,995
I'm with the President.

438
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,369
We need the master key
to room 2206 immediately.

439
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,092
Damn it, Charles!
Open the door!

440
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,052
I need Logan alive!

441
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:52,138
Can they save him?

442
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:55,783
They think so, but they're saying
that even if he regains consciousness,

443
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,077
he's probably suffered
severe brain damage.

444
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,371
He knew he was
the only one who could

445
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,628
locate Jack.

446
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,249
Not necessarily.

447
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:05,959
CTU's drones have been
for the last hours.

448
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,511
They may be able to back-trace Jack
from the ambush site

449
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:11,048
- using archived surveillance video.
- Where is O'Brian?

450
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:13,884
She and Agent Ortiz returned to CTU
ten minutes ago,

451
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,595
- under arrest.
- I want them released immediately.

452
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,307
Tell Chloe to use whatever resources
are at her disposal to find Jack.

453
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,726
I've already done that.

454
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:34,213
Let go of me!

455
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,283
O'Brian, you have no authority.
What do you think you're doing?

456
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,200
- Shut up and keep moving.
- What the hell is going on?

457
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:42,521
- Get your hands off.
- What the hell is going on?

458
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:45,167
Taylor didn't sign the agreement.
She backed out at the last minute,

459
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,482
- but she ordered the hit on Jack.
- Did she call it off?

460
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,704
She tried,
but his ambulance has been ambushed.

461
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,297
She can't contact the hitters.

462
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,382
- How does she know Jack's alive?
- She doesn't.

463
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,535
Everyone is cleared from the floor
except for you, me and Arlo.

464
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,512
Arlo's redirecting the drone.

465
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:01,390
We just got police reports
of an incident downtown.

466
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,560
CTU convoy ambushed, three agents
wounded, but they didn't find

467
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,812
- Jack's body.
- Can you pull up archived video

468
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,481
- of the same location?
- Already on it.

469
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:17,525
- When did this happen?
- Five minutes ago.

470
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,250
Shuttle forward.

471
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,456
Give me something.

472
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:28,959
30 seconds ago,
the van pulled off of Delancey.

473
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,253
Damn it. Lost it
under the Williamsburg Bridge.

474
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,630
Go to real time.

475
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,101
That's it. That's the van.

476
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,895
All units to the vicinity.

477
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,563
They're never going
to make it in time.

478
00:35:57,765 --> 00:35:58,655
Hold on.

479
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,036
Prepare for departure. We rendezvous
with Team B in 20 minutes.

480
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,337
I got this!

481
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:06,462
Come on.

482
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,748
Right here. Turn around.
Down on your knees.

483
00:36:15,332 --> 00:36:16,840
I know who you are.

484
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:21,043
So I'm going to make this
quick and clean.

485
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,265
Am I supposed to say thank you?

486
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,530
Stand down! Stand down!

487
00:37:02,912 --> 00:37:05,264
I really don't want to do this,
but orders are orders.

488
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:07,766
It's all right.

489
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:11,979
Pull the trigger.

490
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,525
Hold your fire!

491
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,199
It's President Taylor.

492
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,719
I don't have confirmation,
but it sounds like her.

493
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,036
CTU has a drone.

494
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,795
They're got a directed microwave signal.
It's how they got through to the phone.

495
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,345
I am ordering you
to release Jack Bauer

496
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,613
immediately!

497
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,724
You heard me!

498
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:52,478
You and your men
are to leave Mr. Bauer where he is.

499
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:55,648
Stand down
and withdraw outside the west gate

500
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,750
until the FBI arrives.

501
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,786
If you have any thoughts
of fleeing before then,

502
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,405
the drone is equipped
with two AGM-114

503
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:06,091
hellfire missiles.
I will not hesitate to use them.

504
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:07,366
Are we clear?

505
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,203
Now, put Mr. Bauer on the phone.

506
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,592
Uncuff him.

507
00:38:16,656 --> 00:38:18,256
I said, "Uncuff him."

508
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,351
We've been ordered
to stand down and evacuate.

509
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:36,563
We're rolling up and evacuating.
Everyone in the van.

510
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:39,191
Let's move. Now.

511
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,277
The President wants to talk to you.

512
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:00,212
You should've let them kill me...

513
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:04,738
<i>...'cause I'm not going to quit
until this is over.</i>

514
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:06,927
It is over.

515
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:11,765
I withdrew 15 minutes ago
from the signing of the peace treaty.

516
00:39:13,278 --> 00:39:15,561
Within the hour,
I will tell the world

517
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,437
what happened today.

518
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:19,865
I will tender my resignation

519
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,701
and remand myself
to the Attorney General...

520
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:25,160
and face the consequences
of my actions.

521
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,499
Unfortunately, you will have
to do the same.

522
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:34,955
I wanted this peace so badly, Jack.

523
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,073
And for that, I have betrayed

524
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,335
every principle
that I have ever stood for.

525
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,346
And I betrayed you.

526
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,159
If I had listened to you,

527
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:50,434
none of this would have happened.

528
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,241
We've both made mistakes
we're going to have to live with.

529
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,027
I would give anything
to take back the time.

530
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,440
But all I can do is tell you

531
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,833
to leave the country
while you still have a chance.

532
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:07,651
The Russians will
be coming after you.

533
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,073
And so will we.

534
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,012
Jack, I am so sorry.

535
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,931
I don't know what else to say.

536
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,391
<i>Taylor told me what was happening.</i>

537
00:40:57,516 --> 00:40:59,865
She was going to give me time
to get out of the country.

538
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,000
- I know. I was on the call.
- My daughter...

539
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,670
her family... they're going to try
and use her to get to me.

540
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,183
They'll be protected.

541
00:41:06,308 --> 00:41:08,173
Chloe, you've gotta promise me.

542
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:10,041
Promise me you'll keep them safe.

543
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,135
I'll make sure they're protected.
I promise.

544
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:14,805
How much time I've got?

545
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,350
I don't know.
I'll get you as much time as I can.

546
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:23,535
What?

547
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:31,196
When you first came to CTU...

548
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:38,504
I never thought it was you

549
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,961
that was going to cover my back
all those years.

550
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:43,708
I know that everything
that you did today

551
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,468
was to try and protect me.
I know that.

552
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:53,844
Thank you.

553
00:41:59,012 --> 00:42:00,684
Good luck, Jack.

554
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:21,733
Bring the drone back to the base.

555
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,082
Whatever happened here
didn't happen.

556
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,692
Understand?

557
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:47,663
Shut it down.

558
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,471
