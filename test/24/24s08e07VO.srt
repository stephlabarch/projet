3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,223
President Hassan's forces are still
cracking down on the opposition.

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,347
They're not showing any signs
of letting up.

5
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:20,436
The rumors have already started

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,585
that the British are pulling
out as signatories to the accord.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,149
Assemble the representatives.

8
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,152
I want to appeal to them myself
to stay the course.

9
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:31,335
One of the suspects
has family connections

10
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,781
to a member of our delegation
here at the UN.

11
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:34,617
Who?

12
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:36,472
Jamot.

13
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,330
Are you arresting me?

14
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,248
I want to speak
with President Hassan.

15
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:43,626
He is the one who gave this order.

16
00:00:44,302 --> 00:00:47,171
- What's wrong? You sound upset.
- We must talk about your father.

17
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,839
<i>I have to go to the embassy.</i>

18
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,299
I'll meet you after.

19
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,780
This has the address and schematic
of the evidence lockup.

20
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:55,930
This keycard will get you access.

21
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:58,671
- How do we find the money?
- The evidence bins are numbered.

22
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:01,686
Do exactly what I tell you to do,

23
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,729
and no one will know you're there.

24
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:06,685
The authorities know
about the nuclear material.

25
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:09,480
Putting Oleg in a clinic
would lead them right to us.

26
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,216
No doctors.

27
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:14,414
The doctor said
that Oleg could be treated.

28
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:16,058
He showed me how.

29
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,119
Who are you to question my judgment?

30
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,373
Never disobey
an order from your father.

31
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,084
I'm sorry, my son.

32
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,325
Tell me about this buyer.

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,716
His name is Ernst Meier,
German arms dealer.

34
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:34,799
- What's he looking to buy?
- Weapons-grade uranium.

35
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:36,762
I have to meet this Meier,

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,931
and I need a good-faith
payment up front.

37
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:42,393
I'm not going to tell you again.
Leave me alone and let me get dressed.

38
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,552
Damn it, come here
or the deal's off.

39
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:52,255
That's right.

40
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:54,682
Where is the $5 million?

41
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,984
The money is in your account.

42
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:02,204
Drop the weapon. Now!

43
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,875
You think
you can roll me for $5 million?

44
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,168
Let me talk to him.

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,905
Bring him here.

46
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,672
He wants to see you.

47
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:13,677
Get up.

48
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,578
Thank you so much.

49
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,943
That went well.
Unanimous support for the treaty.

50
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,657
Nearly unanimous, anyway.

51
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:36,566
I have the distinct impression
that I am running out of goodwill.

52
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,092
Maybe, but you bought yourself
some breathing room.

53
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:41,190
These people are already up
past their bedtimes.

54
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:44,080
We won't be hearing any more grousing
until tomorrow morning at the earliest.

55
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:47,083
Congratulations, Madam President.

56
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,253
- Thank you, I appreciated your support.
- Good.

57
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,256
Now I hope you'll explain to me
what's really going on.

58
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:54,747
I thought I did.

59
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:58,146
You invoked national security,
which is not an explanation.

60
00:02:58,271 --> 00:02:59,971
It's saying "Don't ask".

61
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,476
Our countries
have a unique relationship

62
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,601
based on a trust
developed over nearly a century.

63
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:09,177
Anything you say to me
is in the strictest confidence.

64
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,740
You may tell
your prime minister and no one else

65
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,528
that President Hassan's crackdown

66
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,588
isn't just a response
to the attempt on his life.

67
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:21,284
There are unsecured
nuclear materials in play.

68
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,412
Apparently a faction
inside his country

69
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,401
was disturbed
by the prospect of disarmament,

70
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,382
they decided to take matters
into their hands.

71
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:31,357
- Where are the materials?
- Here on our soil.

72
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,994
CTU is running
an undercover operation

73
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,003
to retrieve them as we speak.

74
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:43,497
Who is that?

75
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,572
My guess is, it is my backup.

76
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,643
No calls till we get to Vladimir.

77
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,022
Does this look like a situation
where you get to make demands?

78
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,023
It's Meier.

79
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,275
I lost my sight line on you.
I'm leaving the building.

80
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,701
- I understand.
- Everything okay?

81
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,821
The money's been transferred.

82
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,949
- We'll soon be at his office.
- I'll follow with a backup team.

83
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,036
- That might not be necessary.
- <i>After what they just pulled,</i>

84
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,252
you're sure you're comfortable
without backup?

85
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,002
There are other considerations.

86
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,083
- You mean they have Renee.
- That's right.

87
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:13,711
We'll stay back.

88
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:15,428
I'll let you know.

89
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,435
What was that?

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,844
- Let him know what?
- Shut up and drive.

91
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:23,304
I got 'em on traffic cam.

92
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,765
Is everything okay?

93
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:30,811
Jack seems to be in control.

94
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,531
Looks fine, all things considered.

95
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,401
Driver looks a little worried.

96
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:37,026
Who is this guy anyway?
Do I pass him on to facial recognition?

97
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:41,799
I've got to take this.

98
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:43,995
Yeah, sure, no biggie.

99
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,702
Just unsecured nuclear materials.

100
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,626
We're there,
outside the evidence building.

101
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:55,928
<i>You're in the side alley, right?</i>

102
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,258
We parked out front so everyone
can see us. What do you think?

103
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,748
I need to walk you
through this step by step.

104
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:05,388
- I know, we're ready.
- I need you to hang on

105
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,637
for a few minutes.

106
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:08,835
Here?
We're kind of exposed, Jenny.

107
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
You'll be fine
if you just stay still.

108
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,190
We have 30 minutes
before the next security pass.

109
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:14,855
I will be with you the second I can.

110
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,934
Arlo, Hastings wants us in his office
for a field update.

111
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,980
Can I ask you
a hypothetical question?

112
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,824
If it's about Dana,
it's not hypothetical.

113
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,827
If your fiancée was cheating on you,

114
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,159
would you want to know?

115
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:32,623
Hypothetically, who'd be asking...
some creepy stalker about to get fired?

116
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm serious.

117
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,502
So am I. Just go upstairs.
It's none of your business.

118
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,470
Cole just called.
Jack's almost to Laitanan.

119
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,137
Hastings wants us in his office.

120
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,308
Pass me back the keys.

121
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:08,618
Slowly get out,

122
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,636
put your hands on the roof.

123
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:17,543
Let's go.

124
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:30,514
So this is how you do business?

125
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:32,016
I wire you the $5 million

126
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,728
like we agreed,
and then you try and take me out.

127
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:38,654
I did not think you were for real.

128
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:40,149
It was a misunderstanding,

129
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:41,817
but it's past.

130
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,309
We are here.

131
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:46,659
As an act of good faith, Vladimir has
already started calling his contacts,

132
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,639
inquiring
about the nuclear materials.

133
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,164
I don't care what he's done.

134
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,078
- I want to talk to you.
- So talk.

135
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,622
I want to talk
to my partner alone...

136
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:05,591
now.

137
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,180
Look, he's upset,

138
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,516
understandably.
It will be fine.

139
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,684
Yeah?

140
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:21,691
This is our chance.

141
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,412
We should take him out now.

142
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:25,736
We need him to do this deal.

143
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,947
Don't risk everything for a whore.

144
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,783
You ever talk about her
like that again,

145
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:32,413
I'll kill you.

146
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:34,223
You understand?

147
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,915
- What the hell are you doing?
- I have authorization to pull you out.

148
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,376
No, that's not possible.

149
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,420
You've taken us this far,
I'll finish it.

150
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,881
Jack, you can't.
He doesn't trust you, first of all.

151
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,341
The only reason he's agreeing
to continue this is me. I'm fine,

152
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,467
really.

153
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,098
You want to make calls, let's go.

154
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,851
You don't have a say in this.
I am pulling you out.

155
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,553
No, look, it's not a big deal.

156
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,396
I know what he did to you
six years ago,

157
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:03,399
- and it is a big deal.
- If we stop this now,

158
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,911
then everything that I have done
is for nothing.

159
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,863
We're running out of time.
Let's go.

160
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:12,003
We're almost there,
it'll be worth it.

161
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:35,097
Are you there?

162
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,285
<i>I thought you forgot about us.</i>

163
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,394
I wish I could.

164
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:42,521
Don't be like that.
Are we good to go?

165
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:57,578
Yes, move now.

166
00:08:57,892 --> 00:08:58,892
Let's go.

167
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,165
There's a security panel

168
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,584
next to the door.
Use the keycard I gave you. The code

169
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:06,619
is 1668.

170
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,384
1668.

171
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,563
Keep moving,
it will stop in a second.

172
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,651
If you want the $120,000 you will be
out of there in less than 20 minutes.

173
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:30,945
Which door is it?

174
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:35,638
It's the last one on the left.
The code is 4...

175
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:37,034
... 660.

176
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:54,112
It's like Christmas...

177
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,137
with chain link.

178
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,619
<i>Okay, how do we find the money?</i>

179
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:02,143
It's in section 3101.

180
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:06,033
It's down the aisle on your left.
The code is 28...

181
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:07,481
... 24.

182
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:14,864
The last one on the left.

183
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,261
3101... do you see it?

184
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:31,130
- What the hell?
- What the hell is going on?

185
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:33,585
What number is it?

186
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,128
<i>Is it 3101?</i>

187
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,094
3101... this is 3110.

188
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:39,427
- Come on.
- What is wrong with you two?

189
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,307
It's called a mistake.
Back off.

190
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,808
So where is it?

191
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:47,897
3101 is down the aisle on the left.

192
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,484
- <i>Down here, down here.</i>
- The code is 2824.

193
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,264
Bin number's 4301.

194
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:05,237
4301.

195
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,212
Man, it's too many numbers.

196
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:11,045
Boom! Got it!

197
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:18,981
That's beautiful, man.

198
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:20,649
That's beautiful.

199
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,778
Just shut up and get out of there.

200
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:26,217
The next patrol
is in less than 15 minutes.

201
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,771
You've got the money.
Close the doors and leave.

202
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,691
- 15 minutes. We're leaving.
- Call me when you're clear.

203
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:33,484
I sure will, Jenny.

204
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,310
Let's go!

205
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,650
Not yet.

206
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,742
Check out some of this stuff.

207
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:44,036
Seriously, come on, man.
Patrol's on its way.

208
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,169
Yeah, 15 minutes.

209
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,433
Are you sure, then?

210
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,228
You haven't heard of anyone
dealing in these materials?

211
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:21,035
All right.

212
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:25,578
Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry to trouble you.

213
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:31,042
Nothing. They did not appreciate
being called so late.

214
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,960
Renee, cut me some bread.

215
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:45,481


216
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,396
You might want to ease up.

217
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,180
You've got some calls to make.

218
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:55,702
I drink what I want.

219
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:57,860
Where's the bread?

220
00:12:58,871 --> 00:12:59,695
Coming.

221
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:01,241
Drink.

222
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,043
What is this?

223
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,667
It is too thin.

224
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,538
It should be thick.

225
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:19,604
Nice and thick.

226
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,218
There we are.

227
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:28,392
She's changed, you know?

228
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:32,353
Six years ago,

229
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,515
she thought she was too good for me.

230
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:37,106
Now, she is much more friendly.

231
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,679
Maybe I should thank you.

232
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:44,413
All that time you were together
in Mexico City.

233
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:46,848


234
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:49,521
I see how you look at her.

235
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,749
- Didn't you?
- Keep talking, but do it on the phone.

236
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:55,668
Otherwise,

237
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,629
the nuclear materials will be gone,
and this deal will be dead.

238
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:07,305
Fine, but I don't like
you rushing me.

239
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:09,080
Get him out of here.

240
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,394
And I'm running out of my vodka.
Go get me some more.

241
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,489
Sit down.

242
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,476


243
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,029
I won't be long.

244
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,373
My younger son.

245
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,356
I wanted to bury him, Father Gregor.

246
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:00,713
Of course,

247
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,736
but that will take a time.
The cemetery workers

248
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,072
- need to prepare the grave...
- You'll do it now

249
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:07,737
out back.

250
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:09,867
My men will dig his grave.

251
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,120
Sergei Petrovich,

252
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:15,790
- this isn't right.
- Then make it right.

253
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:19,030
Like a soldier
who died on the battlefield

254
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,628
and must be buried there.

255
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:24,882
Is that how he died?

256
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:26,335
In battle?

257
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,755
You just make it right.

258
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,431
Say all the prayers.

259
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:34,802
Where I end up, I don't care.

260
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,915
But this boy is with the angels.

261
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,799
My men will be with you soon.

262
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,002
Leave us.

263
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,182
Get up.

264
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,171
Look at me, Josef.

265
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,571
Understand that everything I've done,
I've done for you

266
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,336
and for our family.

267
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:32,867
You killed my brother.

268
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,894
Because I loved him,

269
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,766
because I couldn't bear
to see him suffer,

270
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,944
because there was no other way.

271
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,992
There's always another way.

272
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,740
Not when we are dealing
with nuclear materials.

273
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,812
We cannot take no risk.
You know that.

274
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,832
You don't know why I'm doing this?

275
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,314
Because when I die,

276
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:59,894
I want to leave you
and your family a worthy inheritance.

277
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Wealth,

278
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:02,521
respect,

279
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,209
consequence.

280
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:07,796
Can you understand that?

281
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:12,622
One day you will.

282
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,845
As your son grows older, you will.

283
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,278
And you will understand

284
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:21,362
how much I love you.

285
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:23,854
My only son.

286
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:34,488
Father Gregor is here to bury Oleg.

287
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,767
Will you help him?

288
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:39,996
He's my brother.

289
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:42,614
Thank you.

290
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,188
Call when you are ready.

291
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,152
What is it?

292
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,654
Vladimir Laitanan.

293
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,234
He says it's important.

294
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:03,833
What do you want?

295
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,413
Sergei Petrovich.

296
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,754
I apologize for calling you
out of the blue like this, sir.

297
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,633
- Your family is well?
- I said, what do you want?

298
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,261
I have a business proposition.

299
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,916
Then call me in business time.

300
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,341
This can't wait.

301
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,727
I hear there are materials for sale,

302
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:25,510
expensive materials, dangerous ones.

303
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,273
What materials?

304
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,192
Nuclear rods.

305
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,196
Highly enriched uranium.

306
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:36,449
So what?

307
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:40,161
If anyone has the organization
to pull off such a deal, it's you.

308
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:42,623
- I'm flattered.
- I have a buyer here,

309
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:44,206
a German.

310
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,856
He's willing to pay
a great deal of money for them.

311
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:50,592
- Double any offer you have.
- Then he is as stupid as you are.

312
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,474
Are you out of your mind?

313
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,623
Nobody deals in nuclear rods,
nobody.

314
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:00,113
I'm sorry.
A misunderstanding.

315
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:01,671
Don't call me again.

316
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,065
There will be no deal.

317
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,068
Then we call the next person.

318
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:13,986
You're not listening.

319
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,220
He says nobody sells these things.

320
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:17,406
Nobody.

321
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,667
You're close
to the biggest deal of your life.

322
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,657
He's just jealous
that he's not in on it.

323
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,749
Come here.

324
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:30,878
Later.

325
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:32,357
Later.

326
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:34,660
Once you've made more calls.

327
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Come on.

328
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:48,604
We have a problem.

329
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,122
Vladimir Laitanan knows
about the fuel rods.

330
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:52,586
What are you going to do?

331
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:01,010
Mr. President, it's Allison Taylor.

332
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:03,220
We were scheduled
to resume our discussions.

333
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:06,599
I'm late, I know. I apologize.
The events of this evening...

334
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,768
This events make it
more important than ever

335
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,354
that we complete
our work on this treaty.

336
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,273
<i>I need to know your intentions.</i>

337
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,651
My intentions?

338
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:19,005
The crackdown on your countrymen.

339
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:22,055
You've even arrested
one of your own delegation.

340
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,574
That's an internal matter.

341
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:25,339
No, it is not.

342
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:29,205
I assured delegates
from two dozen countries

343
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,726
that you were still
our best hope for peace.

344
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:34,001
I personally guaranteed them
you'd observe

345
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:36,707
<i>the letter and spirit
of this agreement we're signing.</i>

346
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:37,755
And I will.

347
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,298
Do I have your word?

348
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:43,928
Within the next few hours,
the arrests will stop.

349
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:45,972
I'm taking measures to assure that.

350
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:48,376
And the delegate
you've taken into custody?

351
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:51,210
Will be released or charged.
You have my word.

352
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:53,198
Thank you.

353
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:57,275
How he sounded?

354
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,111
Not like himself.

355
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:06,784
Did he talk?

356
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,050
No, sir.

357
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,413
Jamot denies
all knowledge of the plot.

358
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:12,164
How forceful was the interrogation?

359
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Very.

360
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,293
I did it myself.

361
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,587
I don't believe he's involved.

362
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:20,256
You know Jamot has connections
with the extremists.

363
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,758
A cousin in the opposition party.
That's all.

364
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,612
If he won't talk,
we have to force the issue.

365
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,813
He has a family back home,
is that correct?

366
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,605
A boy, nine.
A girl, seven.

367
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,236
Have the Security Services
arrest them.

368
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:46,824
Apply whatever pressure's necessary
to make Jamot talk.

369
00:22:57,385 --> 00:22:58,294
A problem?

370
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,310
I do.

371
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,697
You rallied us on the promise

372
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:08,095
that you would put an end
to such tactics.

373
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,389
I'll do everything humanly possible

374
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,974
to find your brother but,

375
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,062
do not ask me to violate
the principles that you and I

376
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,238
both stand for.

377
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:26,238
Thank you.

378
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:31,494
With my wife gone, I've no one
to speak the truth to me anymore.

379
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,955
Check everyone's computer
and phone records again.

380
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,669
- See to it that nothing was overlooked.
- Of course.

381
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:42,411
Let's go.

382
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:46,571
Nabeel can stay
and pack up these files.

383
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:01,565
Forget it.

384
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:06,279
Call the Security Services

385
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:09,681
and have them round up
Jamot's family as I asked.

386
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:12,702
I don't understand.
You just told Tarin...

387
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:14,743
I gave you a direct order.

388
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,039
You obey it or not?

389
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:21,692
- I'll call Security Services.
- Good.

390
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,074
And find Tarin's records
in that mess.

391
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:31,543
He might have his own reasons
for not wanting Jamot to talk.

392
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,484
Come on. A patrol will be soon here.

393
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,031
- Give me the money.
- What?

394
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:51,824
The money, dumbass!

395
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:57,955
- We're going to split this.
- I ain't gonna ask you again.

396
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:00,791
Serious?

397
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:09,133
Bitch! Knock it off!
Come on, let's go!

398
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:10,445
Jackass!

399
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:16,373
I told you we should've gone!

400
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,517
Such an idiot.

401
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,522
I received a call
from the hazmat lab at Fort Hamilton.

402
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,525
They've analyzed the traces of uranium
found on Hassan's assassin.

403
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,645
- Did they identify where it came from?
- Sample's too small to be precise,

404
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,604
but the uranium is of Soviet origin.

405
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,490
They're recalibrating their tests.

406
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,242
Great. Keep me informed.

407
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:43,668
- Kevin, are you out of there?
- No, not exactly.

408
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:46,671
What?

409
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,615
You told me you left there
20 min ago.

410
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,883
We didn't.
Okay, now somebody's here.

411
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:51,779
Idiot!

412
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:54,262
Fine, all right, just hurry.
Somebody's in the hallway.

413
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:59,058
I can't believe you let this happen.
If you get caught, I am dead.

414
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:00,159
We all are.

415
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,564
All right,
so just find us a way out of here.

416
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:04,304
Hang on.

417
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:07,817
Stay calm.

418
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:17,827
It's a cop.

419
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,329
<i>He's in the hallway
right outside the room you're in.</i>

420
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:22,915
There's another exit.

421
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,959
In the corner right behind you.

422
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:27,295
Come on!

423
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,050
My God, what have you done?

424
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:35,211
Damn it! It's locked!

425
00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:37,013
He's coming inside right now.

426
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:46,350
You're going to have
to slip past him,

427
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,691
go out the door you came in.

428
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:22,350
Control, this is ten post 11.
I'm at the warehouse...

429
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:25,061
No!

430
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:27,443
Kevin, stop him!

431
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,249
Come on, come on.

432
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:33,319
He called it in.

433
00:27:33,606 --> 00:27:34,706
We gotta go!

434
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:35,992
Come on!

435
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,457
- Kevin, stop him!
- Come on.

436
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:40,404
We'll call you when we're clear!

437
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,222
Are you all right?
When did you get back?

438
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:08,187
Just now.

439
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,740
May I come in?

440
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:11,956
What is it?

441
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:16,570
It's only me here.

442
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,067
It's safe.

443
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,935
What's wrong?

444
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:34,714
Your father
has had many people arrested,

445
00:28:35,124 --> 00:28:36,424
including Jamot.

446
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:41,178
Now he's having Jamot's wife
and two children detained back home,

447
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,889
so they can be used
to force him to talk.

448
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:49,186
- There must be a mistake.
- He gave the order himself.

449
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,274
I thought I'd convinced him not to,

450
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:55,437
but he was lying to me,

451
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:57,068
he went behind my back.

452
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:01,914
Kayla, your father is a great man.

453
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,636
I respect him
more than anyone I have ever known.

454
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,831
But Farhad's betrayal
has changed him.

455
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:11,584
What can we do?

456
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,588
Open up, please.

457
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,718
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.

458
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:22,053
Open up.

459
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,751
Tarin, stay here.

460
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,725
<i>- Yes, Nabeel?
- Miss Kayla,</i>

461
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,625
we've been looking everywhere for Tarin.
Have you seen him?

462
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,530
Is there some problem?

463
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,949
- What do you think you're doing?
- We have orders.

464
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,617
I said he wasn't here.

465
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:48,079
- I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.
- You can't just barge in here!

466
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:51,202
I need to talk to my father!

467
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,153
You need guards
to come looking for me?

468
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:59,625
The president says
you may be involved with his brother.

469
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:01,880
Based on what?
Nothing.

470
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:04,959
Only that I would not allow
an innocent family to be tortured.

471
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:07,592
He's ordered me to detain you.
I have no choice.

472
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,141
You do have a choice.

473
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:11,635
Tell my father he's made a mistake,

474
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,900
that there's no one
more loyal than Tarin.

475
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,321
It's insane and you know it.

476
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:19,443
Don't make this worse, please.
Don't you see? My hands are tied.

477
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:35,458
Let me talk to my father.

478
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:37,712
He's given orders
not to be disturbed.

479
00:30:38,735 --> 00:30:39,835
Even by you.

480
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,300
I'll talk to him!

481
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,331
I'll get him to change his mind!

482
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,430
I understand, Roman.
We'll do business some other time.

483
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:13,967
That's it.

484
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:16,978
Last one. He also knows nothing
about nuclear rods.

485
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:19,200
He also said
it's suicide to deal in them.

486
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,005
Meier has wasted our time.

487
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:24,151
Meier's intel is good. We need to think.
Who else can we call?

488
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:26,956
I've called everyone
who could possibly deal in these things.

489
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:28,925
One of them has to know something

490
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,891
- Renee, it's done.
- Maybe they don't want to admit it.

491
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,644
Maybe they don't know
how serious you are. Call them back.

492
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:36,892
- No.
- Tell them that you have the money.

493
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,064
Shut up!

494
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,222
Just because I like your face doesn't
mean I have to put up with your crap.

495
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:43,859
We made $5 million.
A good night's work.

496
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,725
Why settle for 5
when we can have 50?

497
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:49,492
When did you get so greedy?

498
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,256
$5 million is plenty.

499
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,081
Plus we have each other,
that's not too bad.

500
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,564
It's not bad.

501
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,170
But it could be better.

502
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,172
Call them again.
Do it for me.

503
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,549
I said no.

504
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,219
Come on, push them harder.

505
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,679
- Somebody knows something.
- What is your problem?

506
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:13,099
There's no one left to call.
Now you tell Meier to leave, okay.

507
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,642
I'm not telling him anything!

508
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:17,561
- What?
- Not until you try again.

509
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:20,523
- It's over! What is wrong with you?
- I need this deal.

510
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:23,651
That is why you're here? The deal?

511
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,695
Why else?
Do you think I'm here for you?

512
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,328
Get up.

513
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:45,715
Stop! Stop!

514
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,102
It's all right. It's all right.

515
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:22,835
It's over.

516
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:33,073
It's okay.

517
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:51,197
Laitanan contacted everyone he thought
might have information on the rods.

518
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,991
<i>No one responded.
That's when he said he was finished.</i>

519
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,526
Renee kept pushing him,

520
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,509
and it got ugly.

521
00:33:58,775 --> 00:33:59,872
Laitanan's dead.

522
00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:03,042
<i>- He attacked her.</i>
- And so, what, you took him out?

523
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:04,961
No, she did.

524
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:05,962
She did?

525
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:08,506
Half an hour earlier,
she was having sex with the guy.

526
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:10,018
How does that even happen?

527
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:12,510
- What, she lose it?
- She was defending herself.

528
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:14,941
We knew he was violent
before we even went in.

529
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:17,682
- He's violent? He's dead on the floor.
- Yes, he is.

530
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:20,341
Wwe still don't have
the nuclear materials secured,

531
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:22,902
- so I suggest we move on.
- Move on?

532
00:34:23,285 --> 00:34:24,981
He was our only lead, Jack.

533
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:26,573
<i>Where do we move on to?</i>

534
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,651
We can working
the phone calls that he made.

535
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:31,529
There's physical files
and a computer to go through.

536
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,156
Cole, are you getting this?

537
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:37,076
We're en route from the staging area,
five minutes out.

538
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,036
We need forensics
to rip this place apart.

539
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,580
Bennett can coordinate
till the full team arrives.

540
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:42,748
Do what you can.

541
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,001
<i>And bring Laitanan's body
back here for autopsy.</i>

542
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:46,711
I want to know what happened.

543
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:48,938
Any other good news?

544
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,512
- Excuse me?
- I said, anything else?

545
00:34:57,683 --> 00:34:58,683


546
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:02,059


547
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:03,853
We'll see you when you get here.

548
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:06,897
Our entire operation
just went south.

549
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:09,362
You think you could
show a little interest?

550
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:11,738
Pull it together!

551
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:24,457
You didn't have to do that.

552
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:26,959
Do what?

553
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,170
Cover for me with Hastings.

554
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,911
All I did was tell him the truth.

555
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:36,344
When they see Vladimir,
they'll know what happened.

556
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:46,270
What do you think happened?

557
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,320
It's like you said.

558
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:52,568
I couldn't handle it.

559
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,071
I'm sorry.

560
00:35:57,386 --> 00:35:58,475
It's all right.

561
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:01,118
It's not.
I could have killed you.

562
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:05,915
I've made such a mess of everything.

563
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:09,870
I just thought that if...

564
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:12,327
if I did this,
I could make it all right.

565
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:14,215
I could have my life back.

566
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:19,637
You can have your life back
any time you want.

567
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,357
You just need to want it.

568
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:23,482
How?

569
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,394
I've tried, and I don't know how.

570
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:28,294
I don't...

571
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:31,293
I don't have anything, anyone.

572
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,482
You've got me.

573
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,639
Look at me.

574
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:55,381
I didn't want it to end like this.

575
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:56,921
I know.

576
00:36:58,761 --> 00:37:01,345
Look, we're a lot farther ahead
than we were three hours ago.

577
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:03,804
Every call Laitanan made
is a solid lead

578
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,725
that we can follow up,
because of you.

579
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,558
You did your part.

580
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:09,812
Now let CTU do their job.

581
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:12,045
Please?

582
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:15,693
Let me take you home.

583
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:26,607
They must have been moving.

584
00:37:26,732 --> 00:37:29,665
CTU's here already.
Listen to me. This is really important.

585
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,752
He attacked you, you defended yourself.
That's what happened.

586
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:34,865
- I don't know.
- I do,

587
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,278
and if anybody wants
to ask you questions,

588
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:38,841
I'll be there to answer them.

589
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:43,728
Let me go talk to them.

590
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,913
They're Russian. Vladimir must
have contacted whoever's got the rods.

591
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:11,007
They just didn't want him to know.

592
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:16,295
Hold on to this.

593
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,913
What are you doing?

594
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,757
I need to let them take me.

595
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,207
We have to get out.

596
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,639
You want everything
you've done so far to matter?

597
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:30,242
I need to do this.
Tell CTU to tracking me from the air.

598
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:32,228
They'll lead us
to things we're looking for.

599
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:33,869
They will kill you.

600
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:35,815
They'll have to vet me,

601
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:38,776
find out how much I know.
It should buy us enough time.

602
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:44,219
Hide in here.

603
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:47,702
Take this.

604
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,745
If this door opens again,
you start shooting.

605
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:06,420
Don't shoot!

606
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:07,597
Please!

607
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:09,765
I'm opening the door.
I'm unarmed.

608
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:11,642
See?
Both my hands.

609
00:39:13,193 --> 00:39:14,344
See?
No problem.

610
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:15,813
I'm unarmed.
Don't shoot.

611
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:18,024
What happened?

612
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,694
- What happened?
- They tried to rip me off.

613
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:24,113
But you and I, we can do business.
Wait!

614
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,281
Don't shoot.

615
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,352
If you kill me,

616
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:30,077
you're gonna cost your boss money.

617
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:33,122
Who else is with you?

618
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,625
No one.
Everybody else is dead.

619
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,212
All I want is business.

620
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:20,552
Mikhail!

621
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:30,740
Hansen, upload to CTU.

622
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,911
<i>Site is secured.
Video's coming through.</i>

623
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:37,732
Three bodies.
Are you getting?

624
00:41:37,857 --> 00:41:38,857
Yes, we are.

625
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:41,356
- <i>Any sign of Jack or Renee?
</i>- No, sir.

626
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:42,543
I'm here.

627
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:44,606
Here.

628
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:47,924
It's Renee, sir.
She's alive.

629
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:51,417
Where's Jack?

630
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:54,305
The Russians took him.

631
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,982
The ones
that have the nuclear materials.

632
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:58,684
How?
We've been monitoring.

633
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,061
No vehicles left.

634
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:03,333
I don't know.
They just suddenly appeared, but...

635
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:05,191
Jack let himself be taken.

636
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:07,485
He said that you'd be monitoring him
from the air.

637
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:11,280
We haven't seen anything.

638
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:13,420
<i>Our drones have been overhead
all the time.</i>

639
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:14,895
<i>They saw nothing.</i>

640
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:16,494
Where is he?

641
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:19,931
<i>Where is he?</i>

642
00:42:20,856 --> 00:42:22,056
We don't know.

643
00:42:23,164 --> 00:42:24,168
We don't know.

644
00:42:42,384 --> 00:42:43,312
Step up.
