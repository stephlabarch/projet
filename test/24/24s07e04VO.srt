
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,170
PREVIOUSLY ON 24

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,549
Tanner.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,059
Emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,889
He says you're clear. Good.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,449
Look, I need to prep my men on the nt job,

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,220
So why don't you tell me what we need.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,180
I'll give you the specs when I get there.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,210
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,570
I can handle it.

10
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:31,320
I don't understand.

11
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,545
Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.

12
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,097
If he doest n've the cip device, who does?

13
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,223
Almeida's working for the juma regime.

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,572
This is colonel ike dubaku.

15
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:42,852
We demand an immediate withdrawal

16
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,061
Of the u.S. Naval strike force

17
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,943
By this time tomorrow...

18
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:49,981
The american troops are still in position near our country.

19
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,890
President taylor just received your demands.

20
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:53,961
The perhaps it is time

21
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:56,240
For a more forceful demonstration.

22
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:58,093
I know about samantha roth.

23
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,941
She's hiding something about my son's murder.

24
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,293
Roger wasn't murdered.

25
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:04,233
I wasn't completely honest with you.

26
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,200
What do you mean?

27
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,592
Roger didn't commit suicide, mr. Taylor.

28
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,403
He was murdered.

29
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:11,491
Jack, tony is not a terrorist.

30
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:12,600
He's working with me.

31
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:14,472
We're working outside the government.

32
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:15,330
That's why we have

33
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:17,683
To get tony back undercover.

34
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,462
Bauer, you're going to make it out of here.

35
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:20,593
Shut up.

36
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:22,012
I said shut up

37
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,743
Get down!

38
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:27,923
We got to get you out of here and back undercover.

39
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,211
Go!

40
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,493
Tony, let's go!

41
00:01:55,347 --> 00:02:00,583
The following takes place between 11 a.M. And 12 p.M.

42
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,220
Renee, security saw Bauer and Almeida

43
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,793
Getting into a dark-colored panel van.

44
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:11,792
What direction were they heading? West.

45
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,622
What's happening with td.O.T. Cameras?

46
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:15,913
I've been trying. Traffic images aren't loading.

47
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:17,192
What do you mean not g?Lo

48
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,002
Just what I said.

49
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:19,033
The server's not responding.

50
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,782
The hacker must be jamming the transmission.

51
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:21,971
How the hell can they do that?

52
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,502
Well, if I knew, I'd be able to get around it.

53
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,283
Continue checking ancillary security cams,

54
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:26,440
Atms, parking garages--

55
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,913
There has to be something.

56
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,120
Well, keep canvassing the area.

57
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:31,370
Someone else may have seen the vehicle.

58
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:33,950
That... Fine. Let me know.

59
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:36,171
No luck on municipal cameras.

60
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,993
Looks like they have someone running interference for them.

61
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,092
Damn it.

62
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,571
Bauer must have worked out this escape

63
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,120
With almeida's people.

64
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:43,670
I'm so sorry, larry.

65
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:44,843
That son of a bitch played me.

66
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,691
Had me believing the bureau was compromised--

67
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,160
Someone on the inside working against us.

68
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,712
I realize it was him

69
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,870
Don't put this yourself.

70
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:52,682
He played us both.

71
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:53,820
No, I should have seen it.

72
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:55,122
This is fine, take it downstairs.

73
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:58,000
Bailer's facing a federal indictment-- years in prison.

74
00:02:58,016 --> 00:02:59,963
Almeida must have offered him a way out.

75
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:01,200
Agent moss...

76
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:02,890
The white house is on line one.

77
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:04,270
I'll, uh, take it in the conference room.

78
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:05,623
Thanks, erica.

79
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,151
I'm going to make this right, larry.

80
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:09,661
Whatever it takes,

81
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,440
I will find bauer and almeida.

82
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,200
Well, throw in a cip device,

83
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:14,802
And maybe we'll be off the hook.

84
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,422
Janis, what's the status of that shooter?

85
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:17,992
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

86
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:21,043
But a print match is just coming up now.

87
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,322
His name is alan tanner.

88
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:26,142
He was former special forces,

89
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:28,233
Discharged after desert storm.

90
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,402
Discharged why? Medical reasons.

91
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,311
He made claims to having gulf war syndrome.

92
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:34,682
Tried to sue the government,

93
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,233
Case was dismissed.

94
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:38,642
I want to be informed the minute he's awake.

95
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:43,903
I'm connecting you now.

96
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:47,032
Agent moss, this is ethan kanin.

97
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,631
I'm here with the president.

98
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:50,543
What are you and your folks doing

99
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:51,622
About the situation?

100
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:53,421
We put out an all-agency alert.

101
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,212
Everyone understands apprehending almeida

102
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,220
Is our top priority.

103
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,902
How did he escape?

104
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:00,880
He had the help of a former ctu agent

105
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:02,482
That we mistakenly trusted.

106
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:04,241
A man by the name of jack bauer.

107
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,633
Bauer?!

108
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:06,683
I thought he was in the middle

109
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,481
Of a senate investigative hearing.

110
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:09,622
Yes, sir, that is correct.

111
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,963
We issued a subpoena a few hours ago, excusing him

112
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,392
From the hearings in order to enlist his help

113
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:15,042
In apprehending almeida.

114
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,813
Now you're saying that these two men are allie

115
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:18,923
It would appear so.

116
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:21,470
My god... You and your people

117
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:24,022
Have royally screwed up, agent moss!

118
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,900
Without almeida, we have no way of finding dubaku

119
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,201
And no chance of recovering the cip device.

120
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:30,712
Ethan, let's stay on point.

121
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,422
Agent moss, are you working any other leads?

122
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:34,500
Yes, madame president.

123
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:37,413
A confederate of almeida's who was wounded earlier today.

124
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,680
He's just out of surgery.

125
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,263
We're waiting for him to regain consciousness.

126
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,812
Do we have a time frame from the hospital

127
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,440
On when that might happen?

128
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:45,591
No, ma'am. Not really.

129
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,821
Let me be clear,

130
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,932
Recapturing almeida and bauer

131
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,342
Isn't just your top priority,

132
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,821
It's your only priority.

133
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,031
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,050
Keep us posted, agent.

135
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:57,021
Bottom line

136
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,693
The bureau is not going to be the answer

137
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,231
To our prayers here. I'm afraid not.

138
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,442
How much time does that leave us?

139
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:05,042
Less than two hours.

140
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:07,942
Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat

141
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,741
Behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours.

142
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,630
Now, in order to meet that timetable,

143
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,300
The fleet and carrier air wing

144
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:17,265
Must start withdrawing by 1:00, at the latest.

145
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,917
Which would effectively end our mission in africa

146
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:22,383
And condemn another 100,000 sangalans

147
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,943
To a certain and brutal death.

148
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,712
On the otherand, if you authorize the invasion,

149
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:32,071
Dubaku will undoubtedly engage the cip device.

150
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,790
How far has the faa gotten with grounding aircraft?

151
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,743
Still over a thousand planes in the air

152
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,700
Across the country waiting for clearance to land.

153
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,172
Dubaku could bring down

154
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,581
Any one of them at any moment.

155
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,021
Or...

156
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,623
Use the device for something far worse.

157
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:53,323
I ran for office on the principle

158
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:55,353
Of non-negotiation with terrorists.

159
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:56,732
How can I abandon that now,

160
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,762
The very first time I'm tested?

161
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:01,103
And, if I do so, won't I be telling dubaku,

162
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:02,510
And the rest of the world,

163
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,571
That blackmailing america works?

164
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:05,922
Madame president,

165
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,050
Those are questions for the future.

166
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:11,062
We have a decision to make now.

167
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,663
What do you call this place?

168
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,940
We like to think of it as ctu.

169
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,853
What's left of it, anyway.

170
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:36,713
Jack...

171
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:38,740
Chloe.

172
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:40,290
It's good to see you.

173
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,270
It's good to see you, too.

174
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:45,212
I'm glad you're with us.

175
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,063
I'm not with anyone until someone starts

176
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,751
Answering some questions.

177
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:50,363
Might as well start wi you.

178
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,460
Why the hell are you not dead?

179
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,872
I was dead, jack.

180
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,043
For almost ten minutes.

181
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:58,853
Or so I was told.

182
00:06:58,868 --> 00:06:59,982
By who?

183
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:01,400
By him.

184
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:06,763
His name's david emerson.

185
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,952
I don't know who he paid off at ctu,

186
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:10,523
But it was his people who injected my body

187
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:12,100
With a hypothermic compound,

188
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,521
And was able to revive me.

189
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:15,010
Who is he and what does he want?

190
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,511
Independent contractor.

191
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:18,751
Enlists ex-military and intelligence operatives,

192
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,131
Jobs them out to clients.

193
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,841
Apparently, I fit the profile.

194
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,160
What profile?

195
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:24,102
Former employees

196
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,580
With grievances against the federal government.

197
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,321
Emerson had been keeping

198
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:31,141
Tabs on me ever since I left ctu.

199
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,590
After michelle was killed...

200
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:36,332
He figured I'd make a good recruit.

201
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,370
And everyone else thinking you're dead,

202
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:40,141
So much the better.

203
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:42,150
Yeah. And since then, you've been

204
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:44,491
Working undercover to expose his operation?

205
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:50,980
No, jack.

206
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:52,761
What?

207
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,771
I was really working for him.

208
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,852
I was angry.

209
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,992
I hated the federal government for what it took from me.

210
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:09,533
I ran emerson's crew for more than three years.

211
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,650
And I did some pretty bad things.

212
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:21,850
What made you turn against him?

213
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:23,880
The cip device.

214
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:26,180
Emerson had my crew

215
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:29,111
Stealing components to breach the firewall.

216
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:30,983
I knew what that meant

217
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:33,183
Innocent americans would di

218
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:35,142
And I didn't signed up for that. Damn it, tony!

219
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,613
Why didn't you call the authorities?

220
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:38,513
He couldn't, jack. Why not?

221
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:41,363
He found out emerson's client was dubaku.

222
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,510
That's who you believe has agents inside the government.

223
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:50,092
The juma regime controls sangala's vast diamond wealth.

224
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,121
Dubaku hasn't been shy about throwing it around.

225
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:53,561
How widespread is the corruption?

226
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:54,543
Pervasive.

227
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:56,330
That's why tony came to me.

228
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:58,682
He didn't know how far or high up this thing went.

229
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,613
Dubaku is the key to this thing, jack.

230
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,623
If we're going to uncover the conspiracy,

231
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,972
We have to get to him before he leaves the u.S.

232
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:08,113
That's why I have to get back under as soon as possible.

233
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:09,660
There's a new job in the pipeline

234
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,622
For me and my crew-- I don't have all the details,

235
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,362
But I do know that it'll get me in the same room

236
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,751
With dubkau himself.

237
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:15,723
The challenge is going to be

238
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:18,003
Reinstalling tony with emerson.

239
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:18,801
We have to assume

240
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,370
Emerson knew tony was in fbi custody and somehow

241
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:23,073
Managed to escape. Emerson's going to think

242
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,252
Tony made a deal with the u.S. Attorney.

243
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,762
That's right.

244
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,442
I can help you with this.

245
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,491
Yes, you can.

246
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,782
Outside of the three of you,

247
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,703
Who else is involved in this operation?

248
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,063
It's just us.

249
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:49,591
This is it.

250
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:56,193
Please, at least tell me

251
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:58,993
That you've got some proof that this conspiracyxi es.

252
00:09:59,005 --> 00:09:59,923
Yes, we do.

253
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:01,383
But only at the lowest level.

254
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:04,352
At this point, we've just begun to scratch the surface.

255
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:13,370
Okay.

256
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,873
I'll work with you.

257
00:10:17,886 --> 00:10:19,040
But only because, right now,

258
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,362
You are the only people that I trust.

259
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:24,673
You give me one reason to question that,

260
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:26,681
And I swear I will turn you in.

261
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,251
You understand?

262
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:30,273
All right.

263
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,672
Chloe, set up the call with emerson.

264
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,071
I found two freelancers who might work.

265
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:36,992
Ex-rangers.

266
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,453
You trust them? Yeah.

267
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,282
I've worked with them before. They're close.

268
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,863
Litvak knows them, too.

269
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,273
Okay. They may want to know

270
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:44,901
More about the job before they sign on.

271
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,402
Only thing they need to know is what it pays.

272
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,500
All right.

273
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:55,121
It's me.

274
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,262
Tony.

275
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:01,192
Where are you?

276
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:02,920
I'm at a parking garage, getting a car.

277
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,502
I got away from the fbi.

278
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:05,820
Yeah, I heard.

279
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,580
I also heard it was jack bauer who broke you out.

280
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:09,632
That's right.

281
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,103
That doesn't make any sense, tony.

282
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,520
Bauer's working for them. He helped capture you.

283
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,191
It's only because he didn't have a choice.

284
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,731
He's on board now.

285
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:18,650
What do you mean "on board"?

286
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,382
You heard about the senate hearings this morning?

287
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,440
They're going to file criminal charges against him.

288
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:24,681
I told bauer that if he helped us out with the msion,

289
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:26,342
You could get him out of the country.

290
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,341
Look, david, if it weren't for jack,

291
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,782
I'd still be in custody.

292
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:32,092
We can use him, I'm telling you.

293
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,600
I don't know, tony.

294
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,810
Morgan's hiring new men now.

295
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,153
Morgan's a thug.

296
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,931
He can't run point on something this important.

297
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,391
Let me do it like we planned.

298
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,923
Bauer can take tanner's place and we're good to go.

299
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:46,612
All right, bring bauer.

300
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:47,930
We're at 2211 chesterfield.

301
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:49,193
Right off nolan.

302
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,523
Got it.

303
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:52,603
He buy it?

304
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:36,001
Mr. Taylor, I understand you were looking for me.

305
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:37,552
Yes, agent gedge, I have to go out

306
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:38,803
And I'm going to need some transportation.

307
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:40,571
Certainly. Where will we going?

308
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,290
I'll direct you on the way.

309
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,602
I need a destination for the manifest, sir.

310
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,972
As before, I'd like you to keep this off the manifest.

311
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,851
And no driver this time, just you and me.

312
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,902
I thought we were through with all the subterfuge, mr. Taylor.

313
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:56,060
Please just do as I ask.

314
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,991
I'm sorry, sir, not without xplanation.

315
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:04,791
It's samantha roth.

316
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,493
She says she has new information

317
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:08,152
Regarding my son's death.

318
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:08,950
Mr. Taylor...

319
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,830
I thought I was done with this, too, believe me.

320
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:11,810
I didn't initiate this.

321
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,272
She called me.

322
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:16,422
Brian...

323
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:21,420
I know you felt obligated to report my prior activities--

324
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:24,831
And rightly so-- but I would still like to think

325
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:28,011
That I can count on your loyalty when I ask for it.

326
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,051
I could lose my job, sir.

327
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:38,340
This will be the last time. I promise.

328
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:39,673
Henry?

329
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:42,222
Please.

330
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:45,443
I'll call you as soon as I secure a vehicle.

331
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,920
Thank you.

332
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:51,171
Who was that?

333
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,743
Staff, nothing.

334
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:54,571
Here, can you help me with this?

335
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,931
Sure.

336
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,391
It was a gift from my father.

337
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:58,781
You remember? Mm-hmm.

338
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,943
On the day I won back his seat in the senate.

339
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:05,532
Prime minister matobo has asked to see me.

340
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:06,281
He's going to want to know

341
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:09,191
Why I haven't authorized the invasion yet.

342
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,872
What are you going to tell him?

343
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,603
I don't know.

344
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,822
The american people elected you

345
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,532
Because they trust your judgment, allison,

346
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:20,490
And they're going to trust you

347
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:22,572
To make the right call on this, too.

348
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,641
I don't know what the right call is.

349
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:31,253
The right call... Is whatever you decide it is.

350
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,370
How many units in the field?

351
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:38,232
17-- all available agents are deployed.

352
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:39,502
Widen the grid-- we have to assume

353
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:41,550
Bauer and almeida have gotten outside of our perimeter by now.

354
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:42,900
On it.

355
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:46,402
Sean hillinger.

356
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,663
Sean, its me.

357
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,562
Christina.

358
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:51,390
Where are you? I'm calling from the plane.

359
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,923
You haven't landed yet?

360
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:56,120
No, th-the pilot says we're in a holding pattern...

361
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:58,251
But we just keep circling and circling,

362
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,401
And I can see other planes out the window, too--

363
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,453
Eight or nine, at least.

364
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:04,631
Christina, sweetheart, relax.

365
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,771
But the woman sitting next to me says

366
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:09,002
She heard something about a near miss

367
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:11,802
And a problem with the air traffic control system.

368
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,700
Sean, do you know anything about this?

369
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,881
Yeah, it's true.

370
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:19,241
The faa has grounded some planes, but it's only

371
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:20,791
A precaution.

372
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:22,661
Really?

373
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:24,320
Yeah, it was an isolated incident.

374
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,942
You're going to be fine.

375
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,263
Okay.

376
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,101
I just... I got worried there for a minute.

377
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,380
You know how I am.

378
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,432
I do.

379
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:36,363
Now, listen, I want you to call me as soon as you land.

380
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:37,732
I will.

381
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:39,543
I love you.

382
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:41,382
I love you, too.

383
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,451
Was that your wife?

384
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,672
Janis told me her plane's still in the air.

385
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,681
You okay?

386
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:54,750
Okay, there's a maniac out there with the capability

387
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:57,923
Of bringing down planes at will, so, no, erika,

388
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:00,073
I'm not okay. Her flight is number 18

389
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,343
In the queue, so it'll be another two hours, at least,

390
00:16:02,357 --> 00:16:04,821
Before hers gets clearance.

391
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:06,780
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:08,683
Is there anything I can do?

393
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,352
No.

394
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:14,561
No, there's nothing anybody can do; that's the problem.

395
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,961
Yeah, she's right here. I'll let her know.

396
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,192
Thank you, bye-bye.

397
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:22,461
Renee.

398
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,772
I just got off the phone with the hospital.

399
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:26,312
Tanner's regained consciousness.

400
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:27,250
Is he well enough to talk?

401
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:29,633
He's well enough to ask the doctor to make a phone call for him.

402
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:30,572
Who did he call?

403
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:33,291
Gage whitney pace, which is a law firm, I think.

404
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,802
The second largest in dc.

405
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:37,091
Go grab your laptop, janis. You're coming with me.

406
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,501
I am?

407
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:41,471
Why? Becauswee ave to get to tanner before his lawyers do

408
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:43,421
And because if I can get almeida's location out of him,

409
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,853
I want you on-site to vet the intelligence to our field teams.

410
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:47,421
Go. Okay.

411
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:56,791
Tell me about emerson.

412
00:16:57,348 --> 00:17:00,442
He's british, former sas.

413
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,541
Urban warfare, sniping, close-quarter combat.

414
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,143
Saw action in beirut and mogadishu.

415
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,312
So he's good.

416
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,821
Extremely.

417
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:11,472
But he's not some wack job or ideologue.

418
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:15,773
He's about two things-- money and personal loyalty.

419
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:17,590
Sounds like you still admire him.

420
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,722
Listen, jack,

421
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:19,900
He treated me like a brother

422
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:22,172
When I thought I had nobody else.

423
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,551
Is this going to be a problem?

424
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,813
No.

425
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,293
I know he's on the wrong side of this.

426
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,690
I'll do what has to be done.

427
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,160
We're here.

428
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:09,661
Where's emerson?

429
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:10,732
Inside.

430
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:12,150
Come in.

431
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:21,862
David.

432
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,323
Good to see you.

433
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:29,242
Take mr. Bauer downstairs. I need to talk to tony.

434
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:39,981
What's going on?

435
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:42,972
Bringing in bauer is not worth the risk.

436
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:45,902
What are you talking about?

437
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,503
Have a seat.

438
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,602
Emerson will be right with y

439
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:07,183
I'd still be in fbi custody if it wasn't for him.

440
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,590
Tony, you already made your case.

441
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,160
We can use him.

442
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:14,510
I considered it... But I'm going a different way.

443
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:18,040
I owe him, david.

444
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:18,982
You understand that?

445
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,883
Yeah, and I appreciate your sense of loyalty.

446
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:24,400
I always have, but this is business, tony.

447
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:27,350
You can't have a... An unknown factor like jack bauer

448
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,570
Coming in and messing things up.

449
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,683
So, what, you're going to kill him?

450
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,030
No, you are.

451
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,742
They're going to kill him.

452
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:46,362
He'll get out of it.

453
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,673
Wh if he can't? Then jack's death

454
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:52,011
Solidifies tony's position in the crew.

455
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,960
Tony was in fbi custody.

456
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:56,012
If he'd gone back in there by himself,

457
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,233
The suspicion would have rested on him alone.

458
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,540
So by deflecting it onto jack...

459
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:02,601
We keep tony's cover viable.

460
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:06,040
You knew this might happen the whole time.

461
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,370
Yes.

462
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,683
So did jack.

463
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,970
Put your weapon down!

464
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:37,650
Put your weapon down or I will kill him!

465
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,203
I came here to do a job, not be double-crossed by you.

466
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:43,540
You're already shorthanded.

467
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:47,143
You need good men, not like these two traffic cops.

468
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:49,080
Look what I've done to them.

469
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:53,793
I am here because I've got nowhere else to go.

470
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:54,883
Tony said if I helped you,

471
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,040
You could get me out of the country.

472
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:01,351
Look, if you don't believe me, pull the trigger.

473
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:12,472
What, are you crazy?!

474
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:13,830
Kill him!

475
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,203
No.

476
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:23,143
Kill him or I'm out of here.

477
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:29,332
Fine.

478
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:55,780
Keep it.

479
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:14,171
Right, I need flight 112 reassigned

480
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:15,320
For immediate landing.

481
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:18,413
So you're requesting a priority landing for flight 112

482
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:20,223
Out of las vegas? This is not a request.

483
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:22,873
I'm forwarding an urgent protocol from the white house.

484
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:24,522
And your name was...

485
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:28,882
Larry moss, special agent in charge.

486
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:30,872
This is a matter of national security.

487
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:31,741
Agent moss,

488
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:34,070
May I have your level five access number?

489
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:37,543
6223-510.

490
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,082
Thank you, sir.

491
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:42,100
Flight 112 is moved to the head of the queue

492
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:43,712
And should be on the ground shortly.

493
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,241
Thank you.

494
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:48,503
President taylor,

495
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:51,353
This is colonel ike dubaku.

496
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,651
As you have no doubt confirmed,

497
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:58,233
The near-collision at jfk international was no accident.

498
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:01,350
We have the cip device.

499
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:04,100
We have the capability to kill

500
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,142
Tens of thousands of americans

501
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:10,391
And we are prepared to do so.

502
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:13,300
I wanted you to hear it for yourself, prime minister,

503
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:15,891
So that you would understand my dilemma.

504
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:18,333
I see.

505
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:22,033
Yoare recalling the invasion force.

506
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:24,482
Well, that determination has yet to be made.

507
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:27,823
And this device over which dubaku has control,

508
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:29,650
It poses a significant risk

509
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:31,380
To your people? Yes.

510
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:33,920
It's a technology that has the potential

511
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:36,403
For mass civilian casualties.

512
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,551
And it puts thinfrastructure of my country in grave jeopardy.

513
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:40,801
What of sangala?

514
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:44,553
Believe me, no one is more aware of what's at stake than i.

515
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,652
So you've been informed of the situation

516
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:48,553
In kasanga province?

517
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:52,670
Juma's troops are advancing on a refugee camp.

518
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:54,933
Over 2,000 lives are threatened.

519
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:56,973
Mostly women and children.

520
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:59,843
There is also the matter of those soldiers who have,

521
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,951
On the promise of american support,

522
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:03,393
Deserted the regime and joined

523
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,691
My freedom fighters on the ground.

524
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:07,441
At least...

525
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,501
Provide us the weapons we need in order

526
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:11,352
To efend ourselves.

527
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:14,542
You've been patient with us before, mr. Matobo.

528
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:17,990
I can only ask that you be patient again.

529
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,702
Now, please, if you'll excuse me.

530
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:25,671
Madame president, I implore you,

531
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:27,630
Do not abandon my country.

532
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:31,391
Mr. Matobo, I ll do everything that I can.

533
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,701
I count on you.

534
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:37,430
Thank you.

535
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:50,742
You didn't think that I would want

536
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:53,033
To know about the refugees in kasanga?

537
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:55,241
Mame president, you have enough to think about

538
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:57,141
Without being burdened with details.

539
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,461
Especially details that might push me toward

540
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,173
Proceeding with the invasion.

541
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:03,373
Ma'am, you have to start

542
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:06,701
Focusing on alternatives to the invasion.

543
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,620
Give me a good alternative

544
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:11,441
And I'll consider it. I'm not saying it's a good alternative,

545
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,270
But it's the only one.

546
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,031
Comply with dubaku's demands.

547
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,891
Stand down the task force.

548
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,513
That's your recommendation?

549
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:22,620
Back down?

550
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:24,012
It is.

551
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:25,812
Damn it, ethan, you heard matobo.

552
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:29,463
He's has fighters on the ground counting on us.

553
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:32,480
Do you want me to be responsible for another bay of pigs?

554
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,251
Kennedy survived the bay of pigs,

555
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:36,231
And you'll survive this.

556
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:41,222
A superpower has to act first and foremost in its own

557
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:43,110
Best interests.

558
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:44,760
Always? Always.

559
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,310
No apologies.

560
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,322
What about allowing a third party

561
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,293
To dictate its foreign policy-- does a superpower do that?

562
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:53,932
Yes, if there's no other option.

563
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:56,591
And right now, there's not.

564
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:01,492
What have we heard from the fbi about the search

565
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,132
For almeida and bauer?

566
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,902
Nothing, ma'am.

567
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,773
Check with them anyway.

568
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,623
No hard feelings, jack?

569
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:18,380
Forget it.

570
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,182
Have to be careful in our profession.

571
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:22,873
I'm sure you understand.

572
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:26,002
Yeah. We all know the drill.

573
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,320
Disagreements are fine,

574
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,973
But when a decision's made,

575
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:32,533
Fall in or you're gone.

576
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:34,681
I've heard a lot of guys say that.

577
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,012
Good to know you mean it.

578
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,301
Before you were subpoenaed,

579
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:46,623
You traveled the world, place to place, than a year.

580
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,031
Why?

581
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:52,380
What were you looking for?

582
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:54,001
It doesn't really matter.

583
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,060
Whatever it was, I didn't find it.

584
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:57,960
You must have known what was waiting.

585
00:26:57,975 --> 00:26:59,381
Why'd you come back?

586
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:02,083
Wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller.

587
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:03,630
That's funny.

588
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:06,172
But no, really.

589
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:10,890
Why?

590
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:15,162
This is my home.

591
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,723
That doesn't explain why you turned yourself in

592
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:20,513
To the justice department.

593
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:24,823
Tony said you were in beirut and mogadishu.

594
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:27,493
And afghanistan.

595
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:28,851
Two tours.

596
00:27:28,865 --> 00:27:31,980
Went back a third time as a private contractor.

597
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,040
Be polite, professional,

598
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:37,242
And have a plan to kill everyone you meet, right?

599
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,793
Pretty much.

600
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:41,143
That's the question, isn't it?

601
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:44,741
Where do the rules of engagement end and the crimes begin?

602
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:47,002
You want to know why I came back?

603
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,752
That's why.

604
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:50,740
I'm not sure I follow.

605
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:53,300
I just got tired of talking to myself.

606
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:56,102
You see, I actually believe everything I did was right.

607
00:27:56,116 --> 00:27:58,591
So I wanted to start a dialogue.

608
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:01,393
Come clean, set the record straight.

609
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,461
First mistake.

610
00:28:03,477 --> 00:28:05,080
So I found out.

611
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:09,031
No one who hasn't been to the edge and looked over

612
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:10,841
Can ever understand.

613
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:16,443
It's good to have you on board, jack.

614
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:32,931
What was that about?

615
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:34,943
He's just trying to get a handle on me.

616
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:37,103
Watch yourself around him, jack.

617
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:39,742
And do not underestimate him.

618
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,862
I won't.

619
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:48,610
All right, listen up.

620
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:49,652
I just got the call.

621
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:51,570
We're a go. A go for what?

622
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:53,763
We don't even know what the hell the job is.

623
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:56,502
Picking up a package, delivering it to our client.

624
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:58,043
Here's the location.

625
00:28:58,057 --> 00:29:01,243
A residence at 167 foxhall road.

626
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:02,702
It belongs to the state department.

627
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:03,902
Memorize the layout. We don't know

628
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,332
The exact spot of the pickup yet,

629
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:07,182
But probably the master suite.

630
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:08,900
The package is a person.

631
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:10,553
Yeah, it is.

632
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,412
Former prime minister matobo of sangala.

633
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:17,920
The assignment is to grab him

634
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:19,770
And deliver him to colonel dubaku.

635
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:21,341
The colonel wants to ask him some questions,

636
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:22,562
And as you can imagine,

637
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,821
The colonel can be quite persuasive.

638
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:26,903
Now, matobo has tight security,

639
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:29,601
So finish arming up, be prepared to engage.

640
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:31,441
We roll in two minutes.

641
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,941
They're going to kidnap matobo.

642
00:29:32,956 --> 00:29:34,543
We have to alert somebody and stop this.

643
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:35,981
No, weo nothing.

644
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:36,982
But you heard them-- they're going

645
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:38,403
To torture him and probably kill him.

646
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,363
Unfortunately, yes.

647
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:43,183
Matobo single-handedly led the fight

648
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:45,013
Against genocide in his country.

649
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:47,371
He doesn't deserve this. I understand that, chloe.

650
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:48,902
But if we don't go along with the grab,

651
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:51,003
Jack and tony will not find colonel dubaku,

652
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:54,030
And we will not get to the bottom of this conspiracy.

653
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,162
Agreed?

654
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:00,183
Agreed

655
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:30,921
I don't want you to wait for me. Sir?

656
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:31,800
Just drive away.

657
00:30:31,817 --> 00:30:33,450
I'll call when I need you.

658
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:35,413
You know I can't do that, mr. Taylor.

659
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:36,963
We're already off the manifest, brian.

660
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:38,933
She won't talk to me unless I'm alone.

661
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,300
All right, I'll take up a position on the bridge.

662
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:45,991
She'll never know I'm there.

663
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:49,740
All right.

664
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:25,210
Mr. Taylor. Sam.

665
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:26,782
I can't stay long.

666
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,703
What you told me on the phone,

667
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:30,733
Is it true?

668
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:33,772
Yes, they killed roger and made it look like a suicide.

669
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:34,961
Who? Who did this?

670
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,440
The same people who provided

671
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:38,213
False documents to the sec to show

672
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,742
He'd been trading on inside information.

673
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:41,403
Who are they? I don't know who they are.

674
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,540
They just said that they would kill me if I said anything.

675
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:45,750
Easy, easy, sam. Easy.

676
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,921
I loved him.

677
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:51,590
I know you did, sam.

678
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:54,163
But right now, I really need to know what happened.

679
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:58,280
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department.

680
00:31:58,297 --> 00:31:59,293
That's how it started.

681
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,753
When was this? Jaary.

682
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,501
Uh, early january.

683
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:05,140
The compliance officer at his firm asked him to flag

684
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,040
Any undisclosed ownership in securities positions.

685
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,001
I don't understand.

686
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:10,291
Basically, kickbacks.

687
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:12,003
But what he found was something else.

688
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:15,112
Two of his portfolio managers had taken on a new client.

689
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,180
The bahamas branch

690
00:32:16,198 --> 00:32:19,130
Bank lausanne international.

691
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:20,431
What was wrong with that?

692
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:21,680
Bank lausanne's records revealed that

693
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:23,103
It was actively trading with firms

694
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,680
Doing business in sangala.

695
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:26,972
Sangala?! It jumped out at roger, too,

696
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,851
For obvious reasons, and digging deeper,

697
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:31,623
He uncovered other blind accounts

698
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:33,330
That were copying the bank's trades.

699
00:32:33,345 --> 00:32:34,670
Which account

700
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,140
Accounts that were traced to a senior memberh accounts?

701
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:39,060
Of your wife's administration.

702
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:41,772
Who?

703
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:43,442
I don't know.

704
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:45,741
But whoever it was had a vested interest in the proposed

705
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,320
Military action.

706
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,350
Somebody who was betting against her,

707
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:51,461
Who didn't think she'd be able to pull it off politically?

708
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:54,671
Betting heavily in 10,000-share blocks.

709
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:57,020
Roger was a day or two away

710
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:58,921
From presenting her with the evidence.

711
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,612
It's all here.

712
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:04,760
Account numbers,

713
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:07,480
Trading records, everything that he knew.

714
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,922
I'm sorry that I can't help you out more.

715
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:13,471
Samantha... I've given you all I can.

716
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:16,003
Do what you have to do, but leave me out of it.

717
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:17,871
Please?

718
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:19,872
Okay.

719
00:33:20,608 --> 00:33:22,110
Thank you.

720
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:46,973
Is tanner in there?

721
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,751
Yes. His condition is still listed as critical.

722
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:50,831
Are his lawyers here yet?

723
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:53,551
No. But they will be any minute.

724
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:55,401
Okay, get down to the lobby and keep an eye out for them.

725
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:57,273
Call me as soon as they enter the hospital.

726
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:58,580
Got it.

727
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,250
Hello, mr. Tanner.

728
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:12,103
I'm agent walker.

729
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,370
This is agent gold. We're with the fbi.

730
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,103
I think you remember me.

731
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:19,581
I know you're in pain, so I'll ma tkes brief.

732
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:22,023
Tell me where tony almeida is.

733
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,000
Does almeida have another base of operations?

734
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:29,302
Is that where the cip device is?

735
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,223
My lawyers...

736
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:33,682
Cannot help you, mr. Tanner.

737
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:35,603
You're going to spend the rest of your life in pson

738
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:37,593
If you don't cooperate.

739
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,601
But if you do, I give you my word,

740
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:41,680
I will personally vouch for you.

741
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,683
Helping me find the device can go a long way

742
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:45,982
Towards reducing your sentence.

743
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:49,143
I'm sorry. Is something funny?

744
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:53,002
They'd never let that happen.

745
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,670
Who is they? Colonel dubaku?

746
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,452
Is that who tony almeida takes his orders from?

747
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,090
Do you work for him too?

748
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:03,332
Go away.

749
00:35:03,828 --> 00:35:05,963
Open your eyes, mr. Tanner.

750
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,593
I said open your eyes.

751
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:11,691
Look at me! Is dubaku here in this country?

752
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,903
Does he have the device?

753
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,841
Renee... Renee, renee...

754
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:16,851
Please. Renee...

755
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:21,143
I don't know what you're doing.

756
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:22,580
What are you doing?

757
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,151
Walker.

758
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,081
Tanner's lawyers just arrived.

759
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:27,620
All right, thanks.

760
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:34,923
His legal team is here.

761
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:36,101
I need you to stall them.

762
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,991
Me? How am I supposed to do that? I don't care. Make something up.

763
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:40,730
Just keep them out of this room as long as you can.

764
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:41,980
I'm not comfortable with this.

765
00:35:41,997 --> 00:35:43,013
Comfortable with what?

766
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:45,220
We are breaking about 50 federal guidelines

767
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:47,000
Just by being here. Listen to me, janis.

768
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:48,853
This man is our only lead.

769
00:35:48,868 --> 00:35:50,872
That man asked for legal counsel.

770
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:52,361
I heard him.

771
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,132
Thousands of lives are at stake here.

772
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:56,990
We either bend the rules a little bit right now

773
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:58,363
Or we lose this chance forever.

774
00:35:58,377 --> 00:36:00,613
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just... I can't.

775
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,831
Look, tony almeida and jack bauer

776
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,273
Escaped custody on my watch.

777
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:06,101
I have to make this right.

778
00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:10,060
You either help me or you don't.

779
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:16,493
Okay.

780
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:41,041
Execuse me, gentleman

781
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:44,173
You're out of time, mr. Tanner.

782
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:45,542
Tell me what you know.

783
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:49,151
You can do what you want to me.

784
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,030
I'm not going to tell you a damn thing.

785
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:58,453
Who do you work for?!

786
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,031
You can't do this...

787
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:05,210
Where is almeida?

788
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:08,352
How do I find the cip device? Tell me now.

789
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,011
My lawyers...

790
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,192
You can't do this.

791
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:40,420
You're fbi.

792
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:43,131
This is illegal.

793
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:46,582
I have rights.

794
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:50,843
I suggest you use your last breath wisely.

795
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:57,013
Go to hell.

796
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:20,071
I assure you, I'm taking this very seriously.

797
00:38:20,086 --> 00:38:21,483
Then tell us where our client is.

798
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:23,153
As I said, he was moved for security reasons.

799
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:24,870
Into the annex? Yes, s.Ir

800
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:25,903
Then why isn't he there?

801
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:27,560
Listen, if I can just get on the phone,

802
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:28,383
I'll call my office.

803
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:29,322
We'll get to the bottom of this...

804
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:31,440
We've had enough of your help, agent gold.

805
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:34,161
I... I'm genuinely confused too.

806
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:35,541
Excuse me. Uh-huh.

807
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:38,393
We're trying to find our client, mr. Alan tanner.

808
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,020
Just a minute

809
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:44,461
I've got a ventilator malfunction.

810
00:38:45,185 --> 00:38:47,013
Damn it! He's coding!

811
00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:49,432
Get a team and a crash cart over here, stat!

812
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:51,110
Room 421, tanner.

813
00:38:53,936 --> 00:38:55,712
It's blocked or something.

814
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:57,850
We have to get in there! I'm trying to!

815
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,993
It won't push. Hello?! Open this door!

816
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,801
This is an emergency!

817
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,810
I can't get the door open. It's jammed!

818
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:05,951
Is somebody in there with him?

819
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:10,473
He's all yours, counselor.

820
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:11,353
Wait a minute.

821
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:12,581
We need to talk to you!

822
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,431
Renee... You don't want to know, janis.

823
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:15,581
Don't ask.

824
00:39:15,597 --> 00:39:17,960
Have agent alves drive you back to the office.

825
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:23,620
Hillinger.

826
00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:24,982
Let me speak to larry.

827
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,510
Sir, I've got walker on the line.

828
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:31,901
Did you get anything?

829
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,212
I may have a lead on almeida.

830
00:39:33,227 --> 00:39:34,273
Apparently, there's a plot in place

831
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:37,061
Against the former prime minister sangala. Matobo?

832
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:39,500
Tanner says almeida's crew has a plan to abduct him.

833
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:40,160
When

834
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,240
Pretty much now.

835
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:42,950
Listen, larry, if almeida's still a part of this

836
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:44,903
And we can get there before him, we can set a trap.

837
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:47,443
All right. I'll alert the prime minister's

838
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,620
Security detail and scramble a tac team.

839
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:50,373
Matobo's housed

840
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:51,941
Is in the state department residence

841
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,513
167 foxhall road.

842
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:55,332
I'm on my way.

843
00:39:55,348 --> 00:39:57,641
Renee, do not go in alone. Wait for backup.

844
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:58,912
Right.

845
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:11,690
Yes.

846
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:13,021
Is this major etolo?

847
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:13,781
It is.

848
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:15,602
This is special agent larry moss, fbi.

849
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:16,541
This is not a drill.

850
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:19,611
Alpha alpha delta. Lock the prime minister down.

851
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,392
I repeat, lock him down.

852
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:22,301
Yes, sir.

853
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,032
We're clear. Go.

854
00:41:01,278 --> 00:41:02,443
Where's matobo?!

855
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:03,462
I don't know...

856
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:06,250
Where is he?! Where is he?!

857
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,721
I got him!

858
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,882
Drop the weapon! Now!

859
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:26,312
Put the gun down!

860
00:41:26,326 --> 00:41:27,800
On your knees!

861
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:31,632
Where is matobo?

862
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:33,573
You will not be able to get to him n

863
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:16,081
What is happening, ule?

864
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:18,203
Who is doing this to us?

865
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,713
Stay calm.

866
00:42:19,727 --> 00:42:21,653
It's going to be all right.

867
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,322
It's dead.

868
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:33,042
What you got?

869
00:42:33,058 --> 00:42:35,652
It's a safe room; reinforced concrete.

870
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,451
Why the hell didn't we know about this?

871
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:43,953
You have three seconds to open the door.

872
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:45,621
One... I can't.

873
00:42:46,118 --> 00:42:46,901
Two...

874
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,683
It can't be unlocked from the outside.

875
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:50,700
It can only be opened from the inside.

876
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,022
Jack, if we leave here without matobo,

877
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,760
We lose our only chance of getting at dubaku.
