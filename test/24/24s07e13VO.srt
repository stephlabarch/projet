1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,020
Mr. Burnett you are a
traitor and a terrorist.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,190
Where's the target? Where's the target?

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,230
take mr. Bauer away. He's under arrest.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,900
Ha you learned anything
else about the attack?

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,930
Renee walker followed a lead on her own.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,650
Got a visual on a heavily armed
commando unit lead by juma himself.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,690
Bill buchanan.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,950
Renee walker says the
target is the white house.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,430
Condition red. Secure the president.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,760
There's no safe path out.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,430
Weeed to secure her in
the first floor lockdown.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,380
hostage rescue tea
are moving into place.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,280
They'll be prepared to storm the
building as soon as the order's given.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,560
Mr. Vice president, terrorists
are in control of the white house.

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,780
Until you can provide me more
intel on what's going on in there,

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,880
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,430
President taylor is
locked in the safe room.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,840
What is it I can do for you?

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,380
I need you to find me another way in.

24
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,780
Well, I'm looking at the white
house manifest, and according to ts,

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,810
olivia taylor is presently
in the building with you.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,020
You find olivia taylor, and you'll
get the president to open that door.

27
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,650
- President taylor...
- God, no.

28
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,030
If you don't open the door, I'm ing to
cut out your daughter's eyes one by one.

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,630
- Open the door.
- Madam president...

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,310
- no, open the door. Open the door!
- I can't do that. I can't!

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,660
Do you have children, jack?

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,240
I have a daughter.

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,980
Could you do what you're asking me to
do? Just stand by and watch her butchered?

34
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,670
No, ma'am, but I am not the
present the united states.

35
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,970
Well, I am the president, and I
am ordering you to open that door.

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,420
All right, general, you've got me now.

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,120
There'no reason to hold
anyone else. Let them go.

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,240
********

39
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,800
Now, whawe do know is that the president was
in the building when the attack took place,

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,250
and she may have been taken hostage along
with numerous other white house personnel.

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,800
Vice president hayworth was not in the building,
and we're told he was moved to a secure location.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,290
- The fbi has cordoned off a nine-block
perimeter... - mr. Vice president,

43
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,910
that was agent moss.

44
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,800
What does he have to say?

45
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,860
He's still requesting that you
authorize a rescue operation.

46
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,020
Does he have any more intel about
what the hell's going on in there?

47
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,930
No, sir.

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,440
He deployed two units with deep-band parabolics,
but all they were able to get w static.

49
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,690
They think juma's using some
kind of jamming equipment.

50
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,390
They've also got spotters at every
possible angle around the building,

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,540
but they haven't been ae to see inside.

52
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,820
We still don't know whether
juma has the president,

53
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,050
or whether the president is
lked inside the safe room?

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,060
No, sir, we don'T.

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,180
I will not authorize any action until
I know the status of the president.

56
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,050
Relay that to agent moss.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,110
Yes, sir.

58
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,390
mom, I know that I hurt you.

59
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,740
I'm so sorry for cutting
you out of my life.

60
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,060
- It's okay...
- no, it isn'T.

61
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,960
You were right to
fire me off e campaign.

62
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,980
I felt so betrayed, I
turned my back on you.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,820
Olivia, don't worry about it.

64
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,500
It all seems so stupid now.

65
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,480
I hope you can forgive me.

66
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,150
Darling, I forgave you a long time ago.

67
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,410
Livy, you have to listen to me.

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
We really are going to be okay.

69
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,500
Just keep your eyes open and be ready.

70
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,010
Abo.

71
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,630
- No, no.
- Get up.

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,700
Leave her alone! Get away from her!

73
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,680
Get back!

74
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,430
I said leave her alone! Please!

75
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,220
Olivia, it's okay, darling. It's okay!

76
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,780
Bill, we needto make a move
to try to save the president.

77
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,950
How?

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,720
In the lockdown room, there
were five canisters of ch-4.

79
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,360
Before we surrendered ourselves
over to juma, I opened the valves.

80
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,250
Within the next few minutes, that room
is going to be saturated with natural gas.

81
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,720
It's going to take one
spark to set it off.

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,410
I think the explosion is going to be large
enough to take out most of juma's men.

83
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,670
That's when you can make your move

84
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,040
how do we set it off?

85
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,050
I'll me a run for the lockdown
room. Try and draw their fire.

86
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,520
All we need is one stray bullet.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
That's a suicide play, jack.

88
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,470
We don't have a choice.

89
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,470
Just make sure you can get to the
president and get her out of here.

90
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,010
She knows about the plan; she'll be read

91
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,010
what are you planning? Are
you going to do something?

92
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,710
When it happens, you'll
know about it, senator.

93
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,890
Damn it, if you're planning
something, I want to know what it is.

94
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,170
Senator, shut up.

95
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,270
Read this statement.

96
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,190
It is a confession of your
crimes against my country.

97
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,610
The atrocities that you have committed
will now be seen by the whole world.

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,720
I'll read your statement, general, but
I need you to release the other hostages.

99
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,980
You got what you came for. You have
the president of the united states.

100
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,460
As a sign of good faith...

101
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,650
I will release one of the hostages.

102
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,430
You... stand up.

103
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,470
do you want me to release any
more hostages, president taylor?

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,720
You son of a bitch.

105
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,480
You will read this statement or I will
do the same thing to everyone here...

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,480
starting with your daughter.

107
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,820
General, the uplink is complete.

108
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,750
All right.

109
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,340
The world is waiting, madam president.

110
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,610
"This is theresident
of the united states.

111
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,020
"Six hoursgo, I ordered our armed forces

112
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,170
"to invade sangala without
warning and without provocation.

113
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,930
"This attack was a cminal act
motivated solely "by america's desire

114
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,760
"to exert its power and influence.

115
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Tell me you're shutting this down.

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,120
We can't, sir. It's a live
feed straight to the internet.

117
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,930
I don't care. Shut it down.

118
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,820
It's going out on multiple servers, sir.

119
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,420
It would take hours just to trace them.

120
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,880
this is derek watt hold on.

121
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,660
- Sir, it's ent moss on teleconference.
- Put him on.

122
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,320
- Sir, are you getting this?
- Yes.

123
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,110
So is the rest of theamn world.

124
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,790
Mr. Vice president, I believe juma came here to
humiliate the president and stage a public execution.

125
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,670
We have a rescue operation in place.
All we need is your authorization.

126
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,590
You don't know what
juma's intentions are.

127
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,230
This could be a prelude
to a set of demands.

128
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,470
There are no demands here,
sir. This is about revenge.

129
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,680
Juma knows he'll never get
out of the white house alive.

130
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,310
You're speculating, agent moss.

131
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,460
My advisorare telling me the most prudent course of
action is to try to initiate communication with juma.

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,800
We've been trying to do
that. He hasn't responded.

133
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,380
Sir, juma has no desire
to negotiate anything.

134
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,760
Hes going to kill the president.

135
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,790
Sir, we have a tactical plan in place.

136
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,460
It's a two-pronged assault, and we're confident that
it stands a good chance of catching juma off guard,

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,320
but we're losing time.
We have to initiate now.

138
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,090
I cann authorize any action at might
result in the president's death.

139
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,840
Keep trying to open dialogue with juma.

140
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,940
Hold your position till
you're told otherwise.

141
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,840
I will keep this feed open.

142
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,950
"General juma has demonstrated "that
even a tyrant state like the U. S..."

143
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,850
be ready.

144
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,540
Jack, listen to me.

145
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,920
Juma's not solely
coordinating this attack.

146
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,940
What do you mean?

147
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,910
I heard him talking on his sat phone.

148
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,390
He's coordinating with someone on the
outside. They were giving him real-time intel.

149
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,030
You think it's someone
in the white house?

150
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,830
I don't know.

151
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,630
But even if we take juma down, the
president may still be in danger.

152
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,760
You're the only one I
know who can do this, jack.

153
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,540
Find out who juma's working with.

154
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,510
agent moss, a device has been
detonated in the west wing.

155
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,100
Mr. Vice president, there's been
an explosion at the white house.

156
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,690
- An explosion?
- Yes, sir.

157
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,340
The president's internet
feed has gone dark.

158
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,500
We saw that. What's happening?

159
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,230
I don't know, sir, but we're going
in under my authority. Let's go.

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,070
- That is not your decision.
- All teams, attack plan delta.

161
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,040
Agent moss, you're
under orders! Agent moss!

162
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,800
Code green.

163
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,810
Go, go, go, go!

164
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,960
pierce, get to the president!

165
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,270
Madam president, are you okay?

166
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,780
We need get out of here right now. Both
of you, me with me. Let's go. This way.

167
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,260
madam president, get down.

168
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,850
Stay low till I know we're clear.

169
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,620
Ngozi...

170
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,200
kill the hostages.
The president is mine!

171
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,660
Udo... udo?

172
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,400
No, no, no, no!

173
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,900
Don't move! Don't you move!

174
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,630
clear. We're clear!

175
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,930
Secret service! I ve the president!

176
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,230
Aaron pierce, secret
service. Let's go, ma'am.

177
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,500
madam president, this way!

178
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,150
We have the president.
The president is secure!

179
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,970
Repeat: We have the
president. This way, ma'am.

180
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,010
Renee! We gotta get the president
out of here now! This way, ma'am.

181
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,340
It's all right, darling.
It's gonna be all right.

182
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,900
Madam president...

183
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,650
we're still sweeping the west wing.

184
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,410
But we do believe all the
hostiles have been accounted for.

185
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,020
Now you and your daughter will stay here
until we finish securing the building.

186
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,870
I understand.

187
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,860
Now once we get the all clear, we're going
to move you to andrews air force base.

188
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,030
No, I'm staying right here.

189
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Ma'am, it's r your own safety.

190
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,940
Do what's necessary to make surethis
building's safe because I'm not going anywhere.

191
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,790
The american people need to know that
the president is in the white house.

192
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,050
Yes, madam president.

193
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,990
How many people did we lose?

194
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,750
It's too early to tell.

195
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,060
Medical teams are on their
way to treat the wounded.

196
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,730
We're going to set up a
triage unit in the east wing.

197
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,230
All right.

198
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,730
I'd like to speak to the vice
president as soon as possible.

199
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,600
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,690
And I need to know
how my husband's doing.

201
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,220
Would you please contact dr. Lee
schulman at west arlington hospital?

202
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,690
- Yes, madam president.
- Thank you.

203
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,580
How's agent pierce?

204
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,190
They said he's gonna be okay.

205
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,320
What about you?

206
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,150
I'm not sure.

207
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,220
I still can't believe this happened.

208
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,330
I thought they were
gonna kill all of us.

209
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,490
I was so scared.

210
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,060
It's over... and we're safe...

211
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,190
thanks to a lot of brave people.

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,930
Excuse me, madam president, the
vice president is on a secure line.

213
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,160
I'll be right there.

214
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,700
Did you mean what you said
about putting the past behind us?

215
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,130
Of course I meant it.

216
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,290
I don't ever want to lose you again.

217
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,060
You won'T.

218
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,050
the president's safe, jack. She's
in the residence. She's secure.

219
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,200
M so sorry, jack.

220
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,660
I know that he wasour friend.

221
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,240
It was supposed to be me.

222
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,760
I was supposed to set off the explosion
so that he could secure the president.

223
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,000
He died protecting his country.

224
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,820
Yeah.

225
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,820
This isn't over yet. Agent moss...

226
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,980
juma and his men were not working alone.

227
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,870
What are you talking about?

228
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,100
When I was in the lockdown with the president,
bill said he heard juma talking on a sat phone.

229
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,630
Said he was getting real-time
intel from someone on the ouide.

230
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,950
- Who?
- I don't know.

231
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,460
The point is, I don't think this threat is
over, and I don't think the president is safe.

232
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,780
You sure buchanan heard this right?

233
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,120
******

234
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,010
And right now the only lead
we've got is ryan burnett.

235
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,340
He knew about the attack on the white house, and
chances are, he's gonna know who juma was talking to.

236
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,020
All right, all right, I'll talk to him.

237
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,760
No, the president already offered
him immunity. He turned it down.

238
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,050
He's not gonna tell you
anything, but he will talk to me.

239
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,790
Why is that, jack,
'cause you tortured him?

240
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,830
I don't need to touch him. I just need him
to think I'm there to finish what I started.

241
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,590
And I promise you he will tell
us everything we need to know.

242
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,850
Larry, please, the last thing bill asked for
before he died was for me to follow this through.

243
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,260
I owe him that.

244
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,000
Look, I give you my word.
I will not touch burnett.

245
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,030
Jack, look, I understand
about your friend, I do,

246
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,500
but I got standing orders from the
president to take you into custody.

247
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,430
I gotta get you back to fbi, but I
promise you I'll look into this, all right?

248
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,160
Agent powell, handcuff mr. Bauer.

249
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,720
Take him down to staging area B.

250
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,960
Sir, put your hands on top of your head.

251
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,010
Larry...

252
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,980
if you're gonna tell me he's right
about this I don't want to hear it.

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,740
Yes, that's the problem. You're
not listening to what he's saying.

254
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,810
When are you gonna
stop defending this guy?

255
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,190
I'm not defending him,
I'm defending a good idea.

256
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,560
I just said I will look into this!

257
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,720
Now do your job: Finish
locking down the building.

258
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,110
Agent reynolds.

259
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,430
I need to speak with the
president. It's urgent.

260
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,160
She's in a secure location. You'll
need to go through ethan kanin.

261
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,650
- Where is he?
- He just arrived.

262
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,370
- He's on his wayto see the president.
- Thanks.

263
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,920
The president's in the
residence with her daughter.

264
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,820
They've both been checked over
and they're in good condition.

265
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,880
Thank god.

266
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,920
I want a conference with the secnav and
the joint chiefs as soon as possible.

267
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,930
We're routing all white
housecommunications to the residence,

268
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,600
and we're setting up a
temporary command post.

269
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,650
Good.

270
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,610
Mr. Kanin, I need to speak with you.

271
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,860
I'm on my way to see the president.

272
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,930
Yes, I know, sir,but it's extremely
urgent. It'll only take a few moments.

273
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,830
all right. What is it, agent walker?

274
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,900
Some new intel has jus come to our attention
and we need to act on it immediately.

275
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,700
I tried to reach the president,
but I couldn't get through.

276
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,540
I'm listening.

277
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,030
Sir, the threat to the
president may not be over.

278
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,990
We've reason to believe that
general juma was not acting alone.

279
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,560
Before bill buchanan died, he saw general
juma communicating with someone on a sat phone.

280
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,360
At this point, we can confirm that fbi
ages entered the white house ments ago,

281
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,950
and there were reports
of sustained gunfire.

282
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,520
It appears that authorits are
now in control of the west wing,

283
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:27,400
and we are expecting word from our fbi
source of the status of the hostages.

284
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,000
While there has been
no official comment...

285
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,270
so what have we got?

286
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,750
The president's alive.

287
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,900
Are you sure?

288
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,040
We've been monitoring interagency
servers. Word just went out.

289
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,810
Juma's dead, taylosurvived.

290
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,220
What happened do you think?

291
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,550
We don't know any details
yet, but we'll keep monitorg.

292
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,860
well...

293
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,540
you gotta admire the damn bitch.

294
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,980
She doesn't give up easily.

295
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,540
I'm sorry, sir. We, uh, just didn't
have enough control over the situation.

296
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,760
Greg, you look tense.

297
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,050
Do me a favor.

298
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,280
Have a drink, relax.

299
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,790
juma held up his part of the bargain.

300
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,020
We're getting what we wanted. As far as
I'm concerned, everything's still on track.

301
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,270
where are the weapons now?

302
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,570
A shipment should ready for
pickup in the next couple of hours.

303
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,290
Good. Get chapman on the phone.

304
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,320
I want to nail down some targets.

305
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,490
Sir, the chopper you
requested is on its way.

306
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,460
It'll be here in ten minutes. You'll
be escortingmr. Bauer back to fbi.

307
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,920
- Hold him in the command center.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,720
- this is larry moss.
- This is ethan kanin.

309
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,680
I understand you're taking
jack bauer back to fbi?

310
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,670
Yes, sir. He's gonna be debriefed
and remanded into federal custody.

311
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,430
- I want you to put that on hold.
- Sir?

312
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,430
I just spoke with agent walker.

313
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,580
She told me juma may have been
working with someone on the outside,

314
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,990
and that there may be an
ongoing threat to the president.

315
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,600
Yes, that's true.

316
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,520
I want you to send jack
bauer to questioryan burnett.

317
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,430
Agent moss?

318
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,920
Sir, I think that's a mistake.

319
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,100
Yes, agent walker shared your concerns
with me, and I've given this some thought.

320
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,860
If burnett does know who
juma was working with,

321
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,200
bauer's approa may be our best
chance to get that information.

322
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,850
With respect, sir, bauer
almost killed this man.

323
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,880
I was there, agent moss, but this
will be a controlled interrogation.

324
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,170
We're gonna play on burnett's fears.

325
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,440
Bauer's presence alone should be
enough to intimidate him into talking.

326
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,820
Sir, bauer is a ld card.

327
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,350
We have no idea what he'll do when
he gets in that room with burnett.

328
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,500
I realize there's a risk.

329
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,690
That's why you're going to do this under
my authority and my authority alone.

330
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,650
You're not taking this to the president?

331
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,210
No. If something does go wrong, I want
to make sure the president is protected.

332
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,400
With respect, sir, I think you're not telling the
president 'cause you know she'd never allow this.

333
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,920
You've made your objections
clear, agent moss.

334
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm not going to debate this with U.

335
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,480
I want you to take bauer to question burnett.
That's a direct order. Do you understand?

336
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,250
I understand.

337
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,770
And I'm counting on you to supervise
every second of that interrogation.

338
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,050
I'll expect a full report
as soon as you're done.

339
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,320
Yes, sir.

340
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,120
I want tspeak personally to the famies
of everyone we lost tonight, so...

341
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,030
ep me informed as they're notified.

342
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,120
Absolutely, madam president.

343
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,180
And the minute angela nelson gets
here, send her straight up to me.

344
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,100
We need to start working on
the speech to the country.

345
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,310
Of course, madam president.

346
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,890
Patrick, you have just been
through a terrible ordeal.

347
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,970
Are you sure you're okay?

348
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,050
I'll be fine.

349
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,980
It helps to focus on work.

350
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,540
I understand.

351
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,870
thank you, patrick.

352
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,550
thank god you're all right.

353
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,860
How you feeling?

354
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,580
like I just woke up from a
nhtmare. It was unbelievable, ethan.

355
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,610
I can't even imagine it. How's olivia?

356
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,790
She's shaken up, but
she's going to be okay.

357
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,250
I'm glad to hear it.

358
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,340
We lost some good people tonight, ethan.

359
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,160
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

360
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm thinking about bringing
olivia on as a special advisor.

361
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:10,040
Madam president, I can understand your not wanting to
be separated from your daughter after what's happened.

362
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,930
Especially after what's happened,
we need people who can do theob.

363
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm not disputing olivia's competence,
but she's also a political liability.

364
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,590
Nobody's forgotten what
she did during the campaign,

365
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,200
leaking damaging personal information
about your opponent to the press.

366
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,050
Oliv knows what she did was wrong.

367
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,730
She almost cost you the election.

368
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,160
She's changed.

369
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,000
We talked about it, ethan, and she
is accepting full responsibility.

370
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,710
She has learned from her mistakes.

371
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm willing to put the past
behind us so we can move ahead.

372
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,760
I still think it's a mistake.

373
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,690
I don't care what you think!

374
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I am so sorry, ethan.

375
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,750
You know i don't mean that.

376
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,230
But I've made up my mind.

377
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,340
I want olivia to join my administration.

378
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,990
And I want it to come from you.

379
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,870
Me?

380
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,600
Your offering her this position would
be a good way to extend an olive branch.

381
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,490
I need the two of you to make peace.

382
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,670
All right, madam president.

383
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,430
I'll talk to her.

384
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,660
Thank you, ethan.

385
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,890
I understand agent walker
was trying to reach me.

386
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,490
That's right, but I spoke to her.

387
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,630
What did she want?

388
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,110
Just some procedural matters,
madam president. I took care of it.

389
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,190
Larry, you wanted to see me?

390
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,720
I just got off the
phone with ethan kanin.

391
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,900
Look, I didn't want to go behind your
back, but you didn't leave me any choice.

392
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,660
I didn't leave you A...

393
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,670
How about you choose to follow orders?

394
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,020
- I'm sorry, larry.
- No. I don't think you are.

395
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,560
Larry, I've seen jack do
some terrible things today.

396
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,700
Things that I still can't justify.

397
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,780
But he has been right every
time. And you know what?

398
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,230
I can't help but think that maybe
if we had just stayed out of his way,

399
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,270
none of this would have happened.

400
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,010
Look, I am sorry that I went
behind your back, but I...

401
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,400
I promise you this play with burnett
will go down just the way jack says.

402
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,440
If you think you're going with
bauer, you are out of your mind.

403
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,480
You may have gotten a white house order,
but I'm still running this operation.

404
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,610
I'll take bauer to see bnett.
You're going back to fbi.

405
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,400
I want youto clean out your
office and hand in your badge.

406
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,020
I'm suspending you indefinitely.

407
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,820
Okay. I know that you're upset
larry, but this isn't over.

408
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,510
You're going to need me.

409
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,970
What I need are people that I
can trust. I thought that was you.

410
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,050
Look, you may think you got what you
wanted, getting renee to go behind my back,

411
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,180
but ethan kanin ordered me
to l you question burnett.

412
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,350
I'm going to be watching you
every second you're in there.

413
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,050
You do one thing I don't like,
you're finished. You understand me?

414
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,200
Understood.

415
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,970
You shld leave renee out of this.

416
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,870
She was just doing what
she thoht was right.

417
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,610
Yeah? Well, she may lose h job over it.

418
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,400
She's the best agent you've got.

419
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,790
She circumvented my authority.
I can't just ignore that.

420
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,160
I've known this woman for nine years,

421
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,930
and I've never seen her do the kind of
things she's done in the last nine hours.

422
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,570
We've narrowed the list down to 12
targets along the eastern seaboard.

423
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,680
They're all within 300
kilometers of the base.

424
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,920
How many people?

425
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,210
10,000 to 15,000 in each target zone.

426
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,520
And our kill ratio would be what?

427
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,240
Well, we've chosen these areas
for maximum population density,

428
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,430
so the ratio could be as high as 80%.

429
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,970
Let's hope we never have to find out.

430
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,350
Get these coordinates down
to the boys in tac-ops.

431
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,240
Have them start programming them in.

432
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,050
Yes, sir.

433
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,220
We just intercepted a
flash memo from the fbi.

434
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,350
Jack bauer is on his way to kennedy
memorial hospital to question burnett.

435
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,310
Bauer was arrested.
How is this possible?

436
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,470
There was an executive order from the
white house giving bauer access to burnett.

437
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,420
Bauer will finish what he started.
Burnett will tell him everything.

438
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,110
No, he won't, sir.

439
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,920
I have alreadyent somebodyo the
hospital to deal with burnett.

440
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,550
He can take care of
bauer at the same time.

441
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,130
- Who did you send?
- Quinn.

442
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,450
Quinn's good. Bauer's good, too.

443
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,870
Agent moss, we've locked
down the entire floor.

444
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,750
We equipped burnett's room with
two cameras and audio surveillance.

445
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,030
Where is he?

446
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,390
Down the hall. It's going to be a
moment. Doctor has to revive him.

447
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,180
Why? What happened?

448
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,350
He was given a heavy sedative. He was
in pretty bad shape when he got here.

449
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,360
Dr. Wyndam, special agent
larry moss, jack bauer.

450
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,080
I understand youe here
to interrogate my patient.

451
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:03,790
That's right.

452
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,490
Well, he's still recovering
from his last interrogation,

453
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,710
so if you're here to brutalize
him again, I won't be party to it.

454
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,390
Doctor, your patient was involved in a
terrorist attack against the wte house

455
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,760
in an effort to kill the
president of the united states,

456
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,950
and I believe the people he's working with want
to try it again, so if you've got a problem...

457
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,830
we won't harm him, doctor.

458
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,490
This will be a controlled interrogation.
Please, we need your cooperation.

459
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,670
It's going to take him a couple
of minutes to come out of it.

460
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,210
Who are you?

461
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,740
I'm a friend. What's your name?

462
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,190
- Robert.
- Robert?

463
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,110
- Yeah.
- You're recovering from heart surgery?

464
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,760
Yeah.

465
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,920
Do you have a wife, robert?

466
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,030
No. She passed away.

467
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,700
- Children? Grandchildren?
- No.

468
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,600
What abouthis man? Does he have family?

469
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,310
Yeah. Lots of grandkids.

470
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,350
Make a hell of a noise when they visit.

471
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,840
how's your arm?

472
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,690
I should be back on my
feet in a couple of hours.

473
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,950
And you, ma'am?

474
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,130
Oh, it's nothing a little
aspirin won't take care of.

475
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,730
I want to thank you for what you did.

476
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,780
You took a bullet for
me. You saved my life.

477
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,440
There is no need to thank me, ma'am.

478
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,270
Right, you were just doing your job.

479
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,230
Only in this case, it wasn't really your
job since you retired four years ago.

480
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,760
Yes, ma'am, that's true.

481
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,940
Do you mind if I ask you why?

482
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,600
Diit have to do with martha logan?

483
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,690
Martha and I were... close.

484
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
It must have been hard for
you-- what happened to her.

485
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,340
I'd prefer not to talk about it.

486
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,450
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,530
You don't have to apologize.

488
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,450
I hope you won't be a
stranger, agent pierce.

489
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,710
Thank you.

490
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,530
And, uh... it's aaron.

491
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,720
Okay, aaron. You get some rest.

492
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,660
I'd like to head back to the
residence now if that's okay?

493
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,700
Olivia... I was just coming to see you.

494
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,510
I'm glad you're all right.

495
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,250
Thank you.

496
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,930
You have a moment to talk?

497
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,860
Sure.

498
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,710
the blunt fact of the matter is...

499
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,610
this administration has just suffered
some terrle losses, and we need help.

500
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,180
The president and I would like you to consider
coming on board as special advisor to the president.

501
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,920
I, uh...

502
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,430
I have to say I'm a little surprised.

503
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,520
- Surprised?
- Oh, that you'd sign off on this.

504
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,860
You mother said she's ready
to put the past behind her...

505
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,410
and so am I.

506
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,230
I overstepped my bounds during
the campaign, and I was wrong.

507
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,550
I'm glad you see it that way.

508
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,310
But it's not the past
that concerns me, ethan.

509
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,730
It's what's happening right now, and what's
been happening ever since my mother took office.

510
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,560
Excuse me?

511
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,310
Do you think any of this would have
happened if my mother had a chief advisor

512
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,790
who knew what the hell was
going on in her administration?

513
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,310
What are you talking about?

514
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,470
R government was corrupted on every level,
and it all happened right under your nose.

515
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,310
Even you have to admit, it's an
unconscionable failure on your part.

516
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,890
Frankly, I'm surprised you
haven't tendered your resignation.

517
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,870
You have no right to
speak to me that way.

518
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,080
You don't know what you're talking abo.

519
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,340
You don't have the facts.

520
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,970
I intend to get the facts.

521
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,940
I'm going to find out
exactly who failed my mother,

522
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,650
and I am going to make sure that that
person never is in a position to do it again.

523
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,780
Excuse me.

524
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,840
okay, let's go.

525
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,490
I'll be watchi. You lay one
finger on him, it's over.

526
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Right.

527
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,210
- He's coming around.
- Good.

528
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,720
Wake up.

529
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,550
Wake up.

530
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,550
Remember me?

531
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,070
Oh, my god.

532
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,350
What the hell are you doing here?

533
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,190
I've juscome from the white house.

534
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,840
Juma's attack failed.

535
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,530
He's dead, and so are his men.

536
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,150
A lot of innocent people
died today. Good people.

537
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,040
Including a friend of mine-- bill
buchanan. You might have met him.

538
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,820
You stay the hell away from me.

539
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,900
And I want to talk
to a lawyer right now.

540
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,970
Do you hear me? I want
to talk to a lawyer!

541
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,710
Somebody get me the hell out of here!

542
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,040
You're not going anywhere.
It's just you and me, pal.

543
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,680
Did you really think you were
going to get away with it?

544
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,350
Somebody please, help me!

545
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,480
You're wasting your breath.
Th're not coming for you.

546
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,280
Please don't hurt me. I'll
tell you anything you want.

547
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,590
Do you hear that-- I'm ready to talk.
I'll tell you anything you want to know!

548
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,440
Just get him out of
here! I'm ready to talk!

549
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,360
They're done talking to
you. That's why they sent me.

550
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:50,320
Please, you can't do this! You
have no right! This isn't legal!

551
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,390
- what happened?
- I don't know.

552
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Looks like we lost the
sound feed. Give me a second.

553
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,720
There are no laws in here, mr. Burnett.

554
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,390
You aided and abetd terrorists, who then tried
to kill the president of the united states.

555
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,000
now you have to answer for that.

556
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,580
The rules don't apply to you anymore.

557
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,780
No, please, please, you
can't let him touch me!

558
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,380
- Please, you can't let him do this...
- Shut up!

559
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,990
it could be a glitch in the trunk line.

560
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,950
damn it, fix the thing!

561
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,850
I'm trying, sir.

562
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,320
- bauer?
- He jammed the electronic bolt.

563
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,200
- Is there another way in?
- No.

564
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,630
Jack! Jack!

565
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,140
Damn it, bauer, open the door!

566
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,580
have security lock down the hospital.

567
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,370
I want a high-priority
apb issued for jack bauer.

568
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,730
All agencies.

569
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,490
- it's de.
- Good. Thank you.

570
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,880
It's done. Burnett's dead.

571
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,070
And bauer?

572
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,890
They'lthink he killed burnett.

573
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,400
So, nobody will know
that we were involved.

574
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,640
- Good.
- Yeah.

575
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,590
Now 're having some fun.

576
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,160
agent moss.

577
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,790
Larry, it's jack. Listen to me.

578
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,900
Where are you?

579
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,540
I didn't kill burnett. I'm being set up.

580
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,520
Set up?

581
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,820
A man released some kind
of rve agent into the room.

582
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,400
It immobilized me. He came through
the ceiling and killed burnett.

583
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,850
I swear to you, I'm not
lying. I watched him do it.

584
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,520
Get back in here, we'll work this out.

585
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,840
I can't, you know that.

586
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,990
You can if you're innocent.

587
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,770
Look, there is a reason why they
wanted me framed and didn't kill me.

588
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,430
They're trying to keep you distracted by dealing
with m so they n finish what they started.

589
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,280
Don't let them get away with
this. This threat is not over.

590
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,300
jack...

591
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,740
jack?

592
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,200
Damn it!
