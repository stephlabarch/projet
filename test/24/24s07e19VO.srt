1
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,832
Jack!

2
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:17,800
We need a medic!

3
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:20,301
The bioagent is more
virulent than we thought.

4
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:23,372
All we're doing here is just
masking the symptoms. I understand.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,008
There's something you
may want to consider.

6
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:27,242
What's that?

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,479
A possible treatment
using stems cells from

8
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:31,345
a genetically-compatible donor.

9
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,256
I saw your file.
It says you have a daughter.

10
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:34,680
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

11
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:36,185
Daddy.

12
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,157
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance,

13
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,923
a small chance that I could help you,
and you don't want me to.

14
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:47,821
I'm dying,
and whatever small chance there is

15
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,760
to stop that from happening,
it is not worth the pain

16
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:54,730
for me to let you sit
there and watch me die.

17
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:00,042
Jack, Hodges has 13 Python missiles
armed with the bioweapons.

18
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:03,313
He demanded that I recall the planes,
or he would launch.

19
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:05,383
Tony Almeida is still
inside Starkwood.

20
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,513
He believes he can gain
access to the fuel depot,

21
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:10,250
and lay a series of explosive charges,
and take the missiles out.

22
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:11,512
What do you think you're doing?

23
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:14,321
You're gonna take me
down to the fuel tanks.

24
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:19,860
You're too late.

25
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:31,743
Jonas, we've taken
out your missiles.

26
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:33,372
It's over,
and you're under arrest.

27
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:35,742
You can't even begin to
imagine what you're up against.

28
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:37,041
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,280
You'll find out.

30
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:40,382
Agent Moss,
this is Davis at Auxiliary Gate Six.

31
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:41,810
I have a Starkwood
op in custody.

32
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:44,083
He was carrying a canister
of the bioweapon.

33
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:46,453
Are you sure?
I'm looking at it right now.

34
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:52,023
One of the Starkwood ops--
he's got a canister of the bioweapon.

35
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,093
So I need you to close
down all access roads,

36
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,963
and alert perimeter
units and Metro Police.

37
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:57,231
Janis, get me D.C. Metro.

38
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:58,632
I'm gonna pursue from the air.

39
00:01:58,806 --> 00:01:59,962
Let's go!

40
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:05,172
Come on!

41
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:11,881
I'm okay.

42
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,743
Tony! Tony!

43
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:19,281
Oh, God. Oh...

44
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:33,602
Yeah?

45
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:34,862
Patricia, Matt.

46
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,441
I just got off with
Secret Service.

47
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,132
You're cleared with White House
security at the south entrance.

48
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:41,842
How soon do you think
you'll get there?

49
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,023
Uh, within the half-hour.

50
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:45,543
Do you have any more information
why Hodges was arrested?

51
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:46,690
They didn't give me a lot.

52
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,681
Apparently, Jonas was in some kind of
policy meeting with the president,

53
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:51,183
and things got out of hand.

54
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,822
That's when he requested
his favorite attorney.

55
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:55,092
I'm flattered.

56
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:57,851
I'll call you after
I've spoken to him.

57
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:39,732
Hurry it up.

58
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,561
Janis, we just got an
ID on the suspect.

59
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:11,162
One of Starkwood's
security cameras

60
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:14,163
picked him up leaving the compound;
he was carrying a backpack.

61
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:17,132
Robert Galvez, two-year Starkwood
employee, former special forces.

62
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:20,540
Relay that information to Larry--
he needs to know who he's tracking.

63
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:22,413
I've been trying.
He's not answering his comm.

64
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:23,913
How far away is backup?

65
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:26,612
They're still a few minutes out,
but Agent Park's teams

66
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:29,112
have secured a
four-block perimeter.

67
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:31,411
The bioweapons canister is
secured within the cordon.

68
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,081
Get Galvez' picture
and description out

69
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:34,383
to Tactical and distribute
department wide.

70
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,322
And keep trying Larry.

71
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:41,691
To all units,
I'm uploading a photo of the suspect

72
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,193
to all units' PDAs.

73
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,763
His name is Robert Galvez.

74
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,662
Be advised he has advanced
military training,

75
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,473
so proceed with caution.

76
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:50,800
Roger that.

77
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,930
Almeida? Almeida,
are you there?

78
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,833
Are you in a secure location?

79
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,640
I'm holed up in a storage yard
near the projects on Jefferson.

80
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:28,002
But I just spotted a patrol.

81
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:29,412
I think I better keep moving.

82
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:30,280
No, don't.

83
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,712
The FBI's got the entire
perimeter locked down.

84
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:34,981
And they know who you are.

85
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:36,850
How? TONY: They have a picture.

86
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,753
Which means the search
teams can ID you on sight.

87
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:41,952
Just stay put until
I can get a read

88
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:44,130
on their search protocols,
and I'll guide you out.

89
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:45,951
I should have never have let
you talk me into helping you.

90
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,163
I promise you,
that canister you stole for me

91
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:50,763
is worth a lot of money to
the people I'm working for.

92
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:53,303
Hell of a lot of good that
money's gonna do me in prison.

93
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:55,160
Just shut up and do
what I tell you to do.

94
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:58,502
Guard the canister, stay put,
and wait for my call.

95
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:11,583
We've got agents down.

96
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:15,081
Get a med team out here now.

97
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:17,191
Almeida?

98
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,361
Almeida, can you hear me?

99
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:21,631
What happened?

100
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,961
Where's the suspect?

101
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:24,260
He ambushed us.

102
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,503
Did you see where he went?

103
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,403
I don't know.

104
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:33,000
Renee, I just got confirmation the
Tac Team has arrived at the scene.

105
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,943
Do we have a 20 on Larry?
Not yet.

106
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:37,370
Excuse me, Agent Walker.

107
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:38,710
I know you're busy. Kim.

108
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,710
I just came to say good-bye.

109
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,113
Good-bye? Where are you going?

110
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:43,811
Back to L.A.

111
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,552
Um, I don't understand.

112
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:48,592
You're not going through with the
treatment to help your father?

113
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,051
I mean,
it's his only chance for a cure.

114
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,560
I know that, and so does he.

115
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:56,090
But it's a slim one,
and he believes

116
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,892
it's not worth taking, so...

117
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,472
If he's going to die,
he wants it to be on his terms.

118
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,503
Yes, but can't you
change his mind?

119
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:08,341
I would think you'd know by now that
no one can change my father's mind

120
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:09,511
when it's made up.

121
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,012
I'm... I'm sorry.

122
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:14,980
I'm sorry that I put
you in this position.

123
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:16,210
No, don't be.

124
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:18,351
I'm grateful to you,
Agent Walker.

125
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:20,923
My father and I got to say a
lot of things to each other.

126
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:24,290
I wish I could have said more, but I
don't want to cause him any more pain.

127
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,161
Renee?

128
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,020
Agent Park is on
the phone for you.

129
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:30,130
I need to take this.

130
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:33,333
I understand.

131
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,302
Good luck.

132
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,641
This is Walker.

133
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:42,310
Agent Moss is dead.

134
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,611
What?

135
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,482
Apparently, he was killed in
an ambush by the suspect.

136
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:49,712
The chopper pilot, too.

137
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,821
Tony Almeida's been shot,
but he's alive.

138
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:55,182
I've got medical personnel
working on him now.

139
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,220
Agent Walker?

140
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:02,131
Do we have any lead on Galvez?

141
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:04,232
No, but the area's
been cordoned off.

142
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:05,560
He couldn't have gotten far.

143
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:09,470
We're setting up an operations base here
on the scene to coordinate the manhunt.

144
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,035
How do you want to proceed?

145
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,447
Me?

146
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,603
You're the ranking
agent in charge now.

147
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:20,813
Maintain the perimeter.

148
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:23,283
Begin a south-north sweep.

149
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:26,553
I'll chopper out a team and meet
you there as soon as I can.

150
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:28,881
Agent Walker,
I have more than enough personnel.

151
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:31,822
You don't need to be involved
in the search. Yes, I do.

152
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:34,831
Keep me posted if
you hear anything.

153
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,833
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:38,230
Larry?

155
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:41,702
He was killed in a
shootout with the suspect.

156
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,670
Oh, God.

157
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:46,230
I need you to brief the White
House on what's happened.

158
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:49,213
Call Dr. Macer and have her deploy
a HazMat team to the perimeter line.

159
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:52,542
Assemble a team to
chopper out with me.

160
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:55,680
I'm so sorry.

161
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,413
Someone's going to need to
notify Larry's ex-wife.

162
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,792
Probably shouldn't be me.

163
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:04,753
It's okay.
I'll take care of it.

164
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:14,060
All right.

165
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:16,900
We've debriefed on hours 8:00 a.m.
to 3:00 p.m.

166
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:20,202
pertaining to the CIP recovery
and the capture of Ike Dubaku.

167
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:23,542
Now, Mr.
Bauer, maybe you'd like to take a break.

168
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:26,140
No. We need to finish
this while I still can.

169
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:27,313
Let's go.

170
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:30,153
Now, according to your
earlier statement,

171
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,723
it was about this
time you received

172
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:34,151
intel regarding the imminent
attack on the White House.

173
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:37,950
Tony Almeida provided me with the intel,
but we did not know

174
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,323
the White House was a
target at that time.

175
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,961
And who was Mr.
Almeida's source?

176
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:44,632
He was interrogating
a mercenary.

177
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,403
Did Almeida give you a name?

178
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,263
Um...

179
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,430
Yeah. Sorry.

180
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:55,172
Car... Cardiff.
He said his name was Vincent Cardiff.

181
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,911
Did you yourself
question the source?

182
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,140
No.

183
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:01,012
He didn't survive
Tony's interrogation,

184
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:04,752
but he was the one who provided us
with the intel on the upcoming attack.

185
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:08,053
But we did not know that the White House
was the intended target at that time.

186
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,350
We did not know the White House
was the intended target...

187
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,420
Mr. Bauer?

188
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,562
You sure you don't want
to take that break?

189
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,190
Um, I'm repeating myself again.

190
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:24,002
Here's the data file
you asked for, sir.

192
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:25,703
Tom, we need to move.

193
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,341
Agent Walker's got
our assignments.

194
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,682
Excuse me.

195
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:39,352
We're not going to lose
control of this situation.

196
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,953
I know that most of you are tired,
working double shifts,

197
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,551
but I need each and every
one of you focused and alert

198
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,210
if we are going to
locate the suspect

199
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,323
and secure the bioweapon
canister that he's carrying.

200
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,153
While I am out in the field,
you will pass all pertinent information

201
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,561
out of this office
through Janis.

202
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,903
Let's get to work.
Adams, you and your men are with me.

203
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,233
Renee? Renee?

204
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,040
I'll meet you at the helipad.

205
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,570
The bioweapon's
still out there?

206
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,711
We have it contained.

207
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,211
Wait a second.

208
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,410
Wait a second.

209
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,151
Just tell me what
the hell is going on.

210
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,513
A Starkwood operative by
the name of Robert Galvez

211
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:10,151
got away with a canister
of the pathogen.

212
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:13,321
We have him trapped inside a perimeter
a mile or so from Starkwood's compound.

213
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:14,783
Is Larry in command
of the perimeter?

214
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:16,191
He was killed in a firefight.

215
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:17,253
What?

216
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,261
Tony was injured.

217
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,490
He's at the scene with
the advance team.

218
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,260
Larry's dead?

219
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,030
We have two agents down.

220
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,233
Yes. I have to go.

221
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:35,401
You're lucky.
An inch to the left,

222
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:37,540
the bullet might have
nicked your splenic artery.

223
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,542
You need to get yourself checked
out at the hospital, sir.

224
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:40,981
Yeah, I can't do
that right now.

225
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,751
Let me get you
something for the pain.

226
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:45,021
No, I,
I need to keep my head clear.

227
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,882
Sweep 9, this is Mobile Command,
what's your status?

228
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,390
Mobile Command, this is Sweep 9,
Southeast grid 211 clear.

229
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:51,762
Moving on. Copy that, Sweep 9.

230
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:53,463
Sweep 7, what's your position?

231
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,360
Clearing 214. Nothing so far.

232
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:56,732
No sign of him?

233
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:57,761
Don't worry.

234
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:58,931
We'll find him.

235
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:00,732
You should get some rest.

236
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,903
Thanks.

237
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:07,101
...this is Mobile Command,
status check, over.

238
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,210
Yeah? Yeah, they're sweeping north,
clearing grids.

239
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:17,052
You've got a clear path on Jefferson
all the way up to 12th and 13th Street.

240
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,223
That should be the last
sector they're searching.

241
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:22,023
Judging by their progress,
it'll give you about 30 minutes.

242
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:23,392
Should be plenty of time.

243
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,561
Time for what?

244
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,561
You still got that
C-4 I gave you?

245
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:29,560
Yeah. I got it. All right.

246
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:33,331
I want you to find a structure, a store,
warehouse, something big enough

247
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:34,961
where they have to
enter and search.

248
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:39,772
We need to draw as many of them into
the building as possible, then blow it.

249
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:42,440
You want me to blow up a
couple of dozen FBI agents?

250
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:43,743
You got a problem with that?

251
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:45,043
They're still gonna have
the perimeter locked down.

252
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:47,843
I don't see how doing this is gonna
get me out of here with the canister.

253
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:49,711
Yeah, I've got that worked out.

254
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,333
Jack, what the hell
are you doing?

255
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,032
I'm going with you.

256
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,262
You're ill.

257
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:11,203
If my condition interferes with
your operation, I will stand down.

258
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:12,671
I give you my word. Jack...

259
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:15,403
You want keep arguing about this,
waste more time? Fine.

260
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,072
I'm not getting out.

261
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:41,303
Good morning.

262
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:43,530
Good morning.

263
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:45,732
Ms. Eames.

264
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:47,403
You're Jonas Hodges' attorney.

265
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,142
That's right.

266
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:50,711
They told us to expect you.

267
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,512
I just need you to place your
thumb against the glass.

268
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:08,060
Okay. Sergeant Cadden will
escort you to the holding area.

269
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,661
Thank you.

270
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,161
How could this man have
gotten out of Starkwood

271
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:16,603
with a canister
of the bioweapon?

272
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:17,373
No one's sure.

273
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,230
But he's already
murdered four people.

274
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,301
Including Larry Moss.

275
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:26,671
The FBI has tracked him to a
nearby residential district.

276
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:30,340
They've sealed off the area and
are conducting a thorough search.

277
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,381
Mom, this man Galvez is
a Starkwood operative.

278
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:35,021
Clearly, Hodges is behind this.

279
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:36,351
Maybe.

280
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,090
What do you mean, maybe?

281
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,720
As Hodges was taken away,
he said it wasn't over.

282
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:46,861
He alluded to others,
called himself

283
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:49,761
a small cog in a very large
machine that I wouldn't

284
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,301
be able to stop.
He was ranting.

285
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,730
That doesn't mean he
wasn't telling the truth.

286
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,903
We need to find out what
Hodges knows about this.

287
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,011
I want him taken to the
FBI for interrogation.

288
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:01,040
He's a sociopath, Mom.

289
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:03,112
He's not going to talk.
He's going to want

290
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:06,053
to make some kind of deal in
exchange for his cooperation.

291
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:10,792
Mom, you're not
considering that...

292
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:11,923
Olivia...

293
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,890
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

294
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:17,063
Just get him to FBI.

295
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:28,441
Mr. Hodges.

296
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,573
Your attorney's
here to see you.

297
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:33,210
Well, it's about damn time.

298
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,120
We're going to
need some privacy.

299
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:53,461
You're a little
taller than her.

300
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:56,500
But it's a good look for you.

301
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,500
Hello, Jonas.

302
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,503
I'm not going to
ask how you got in.

303
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:04,872
But I'm definitely interested in
how you're going to get me out.

304
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,982
Jonas, you're in a very
difficult position.

305
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:13,653
And your actions today have put everyone
else in a very difficult position.

306
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:15,480
Oh, I see.

307
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:18,490
I've upset the cart, have I?

308
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:21,493
Everyone's bent out of shape.

309
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:25,330
Well, where the hell were they when
the government came after my company?

310
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:28,001
When Senator Mayer and his
subpoena-waving goon squad

311
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,532
were trying to ruin me
and everything I've built?

312
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,572
You would have been
protected, Jonas.

313
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:34,701
You and Starkwood.

314
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,713
But you jeopardized the plan.

315
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:42,413
That bioweapon that you developed for
us was not intended for personal use.

316
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:47,252
The consensus is that
you've had some sort of...

317
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,250
psychotic break.

318
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,252
Well, the consensus is wrong.

319
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,523
Coming from you right now,
that's not much comfort.

320
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:56,561
I want to talk to them.

321
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:58,932
Get some form of
communication between us.

322
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,191
I want to talk to them.

323
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,803
I think it's a little
late for that, Jonas.

324
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:05,071
You've brought undue attention
by showing your hand.

325
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:05,900
Exposing yourself.

326
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,873
And I'm sure you could understand
their concern that you may,

327
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:11,270
in fact,
expose the others as well.

328
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,971
How can I do that?
I don't know who they are.

329
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:16,281
You know enough,
and they need to be certain.

330
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:20,580
I think we can agree that
there's no reason for your family

331
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:23,582
to pay for your mistakes.

332
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:25,251
Is that why you're here?

333
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:26,593
To threaten my family.

334
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:28,120
On the contrary.

335
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,393
I came to guarantee
your family's safety.

336
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:34,190
If you do the right thing.

337
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:44,440
This will induce cardiac arrest,
and leave no trace in your system.

338
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:47,612
A natural, dignified death.

339
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:50,813
Without you to prosecute,
the case against you and your

340
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,751
company will be difficult,
likely impossible,

341
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:59,121
preserving at least some small part of
Starkwood's legacy of patriotic service.

342
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,093
Which I know is very
important to you.

343
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:24,851
Party's over, counselor.

344
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:26,381
We're moving him to the Bureau.

345
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,481
My client has invoked his right
to silence and to counsel.

346
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:33,190
No one speaks to him unless in
my presence, is that understood?

347
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:35,220
In some countries they'd
have shot him by now.

348
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,322
Process him out.

349
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:52,943
Step out of the cell
and raise your arms.

350
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,310
Yes?

351
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:58,552
I met with him.

352
00:18:58,716 --> 00:18:59,711
And?

353
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,612
I'm quite certain he
understands our terms.

354
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,820
They're transferring him to
the FBI for interrogation.

355
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:04,923
Will that be a problem?

356
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:06,451
Hopefully, it'll
just pressure him

357
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,552
to resolve the situation
sooner rather than later.

358
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,691
I'll be happy when
this is behind us.

359
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,233
Have you heard from Almeida?

360
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,233
He called in before
I met with Hodges.

361
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,233
Has he secured the canister?

362
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:18,230
Soon.

363
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:20,001
He's your guy.
Better not screw this up.

364
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:24,002
Tony's been the one bright spot
in an otherwise dreary day.

365
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:26,170
I have faith he'll
come through.

366
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,012
Yeah?

367
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,752
I found a place to set up.

368
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:36,922
It's an abandoned apartment building
just shy of the north perimeter line.

369
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:40,723
1297 Rincon, corner of 12th.

370
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:42,123
Yeah, I see it.

371
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:46,131
Sweep teams are just entering
three sectors to the south.

372
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,583
You've got less
than 20 minutes.

373
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:49,131
That doesn't give me much time.

374
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:53,033
No, it doesn't, so maybe you should
get off the phone and get to it.

375
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:36,411
I lost two partners in a row.

376
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,712
Early on.

377
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,752
I couldn't handle it.

378
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:50,420
I guess that's why over the last ten
years, I've pretty much worked alone.

379
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:57,032
It's all right for you to
be feeling what you feel.

380
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:01,203
And if you can't do this tonight,
that's all right, too.

381
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:05,210
Just don't try and pretend like
you're not feeling anything.

382
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:07,110
That's how you make a mistake.

383
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:11,982
Please, Jack, don't tell me what to
feel and don't tell me how to feel it.

384
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,432
Agent Walker.

385
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,880
He's over there.

386
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:50,251
Jack! Where is he?

387
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:51,920
This way. You okay?

388
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:52,990
Yeah, I got lucky.

389
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:54,493
The bullet went
straight through.

390
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:56,022
Didn't think I'd
see you out here.

391
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,093
I'm only here for observation.

392
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:03,500
You do not have to do this.

393
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,171
Show me.

394
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:46,141
I'm sorry about Larry.

395
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:48,080
How the hell did this happen?

396
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:51,542
It all went down pretty fast,
I mean...

397
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:54,310
We were ambushed before we
got out of the helicopter.

398
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,420
The chopper pilot
was hit first.

399
00:22:57,596 --> 00:23:01,993
I was unarmed, so Larry laid
down cover so I could get clear.

400
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,623
I don't remember a lot,
but I definitely heard auto-fire.

401
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:10,403
As I was tagged, Larry came over to
help me out and that's when he was hit.

402
00:23:11,436 --> 00:23:12,771
I blacked out after that.

403
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,843
But I'm pretty sure
Larry saved my life.

404
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,941
Larry was hit with
heavy ordnance.

405
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:19,362
Shotgun rounds, armor piercing.

406
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,273
You were obviously hit
with something smaller.

407
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:22,843
Jacketed. MED TECH:
I treated Mr. Almeida.

408
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:24,980
His wound was consistent
with a nine millimeter.

409
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,980
JACK: You sure it wasn't a .45?

410
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,483
Not likely--
the entry was too small. Why?

411
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:32,520
Because you have spent
.45 casings in evidence.

412
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:37,263
Galvez had access to the weapons
inside the FBI vehicle he stole.

413
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:39,362
He probably switched in
the middle of the fight.

414
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,292
That many weapons?

415
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:42,863
In the time frame that
you described the ambush?

416
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:44,163
It doesn't add up.

417
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:47,131
Okay, so what are you saying?
Someone was with him.

418
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:50,603
Like I said,
it all happened pretty fast, but...

419
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:52,371
I mean, I didn't think so.

420
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:55,942
I guess it makes sense.

421
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:58,213
One man didn't do this alone.
He had help.

422
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:01,350
I'll tell Park to
alert the field.

423
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,353
You sure you're okay?

424
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:05,150
Yeah, I'm fine.

425
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:06,892
Good.

426
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:25,982
Hello?

427
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:27,010
Did I wake you?

428
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:29,310
Who could sleep after
what happened today?

429
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,113
How did it go with your father?

430
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:35,950
Sweetheart, what is it?

431
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:37,622
What happened?

432
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:40,762
He's dying, Stephen.

433
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:42,520
What?

434
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:45,963
He was exposed to something.

435
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:47,731
Like a biological agent.

436
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:51,071
It had something to do with the
attacks that took place earlier today.

437
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:55,103
Kim, honey, I'm so sorry.

438
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,612
Um, isn't there anything
that they can do?

439
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:02,912
No.

440
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,681
I'm coming back home.

441
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:09,382
Don't you want to stay? Don't you
wanna be with him as long as you can?

442
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:12,963
My presence,
with what he's going through right now,

443
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,722
will only make things worse.

444
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:21,733
Did you at least, um, did you
tell him about his granddaughter?

445
00:25:25,177 --> 00:25:26,201
Kim?

446
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:27,471
I couldn't, Stephen.

447
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:29,201
I couldn't bring
myself to tell him

448
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:32,783
I wasn't the only person
he was leaving behind.

449
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:36,051
Telling him about Teri
would've only made it worse.

450
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:38,583
I'm gonna try and
get on the 7:10.

451
00:25:38,757 --> 00:25:41,050
If I do, I'll be back in L.A.
by 9:00.

452
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,381
Okay.

453
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:45,250
You can always leave later,
if you change your mind.

454
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:48,821
t.

455
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:50,791
I love you both.

456
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,431
We love you, too.

457
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:55,601
Bye.

458
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:09,081
Mobile Command,
this is Sweep 9.

459
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:10,182
221 is clear.

460
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:12,751
Copy, 9. Proceed to 224.

461
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:16,282
Why has that area of the
grid not been cleared?

462
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:17,981
Sweep 3,
why have you not cleared 219?

463
00:26:18,157 --> 00:26:21,423
Mobile Command, we're encountering some
resistance from neighborhood residents.

464
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:23,190
They're not happy about
their homes being searched

465
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:24,942
without a warrant at
2:30 in the morning.

466
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:27,032
I'm concerned about their safety,
not their happiness.

467
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:29,261
Whoever is helping Galvez
may be providing him shelter

468
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,213
in one of those houses.
If those civilians are

469
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:33,232
interfering in that sweep,
arrest them, but get that

470
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:34,601
area cleared.
Do you understand?

471
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,500
Copy.

472
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:37,812
Jack?

473
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,241
Excuse me...

474
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:17,683
It's an antiseizure medicine.

475
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:20,282
I should've used it earlier.

476
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:22,050
Jack, what are you
doing out here?

477
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,420
Why don't you go back to FBI
medical and let them treat you?

478
00:27:25,598 --> 00:27:28,022
There is no treatment.

479
00:27:28,197 --> 00:27:29,392
There's no cure.

480
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:30,633
Wait.

481
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:34,933
I'm sorry.

482
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:36,333
I didn't know.

483
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:38,270
Yeah.

484
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:40,203
Why are you in the field?

485
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,800
Agent Walker just lost
her partner, Tony.

486
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:49,343
I thought I could help.
I owe her that much.

487
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,412
Agent Stoller to Mobile Command.
Code Yellow.

488
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:53,682
Go ahead, Agent Stoller,
this is Mobile Command.

489
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:55,122
Are you reporting
a Code Yellow?

490
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:56,220
Affirmative.

491
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:59,193
I have a confirmed visual
on the target suspect

492
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:00,590
with the canister.

493
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:04,362
Repeat, confirmed visual
of suspect and canister.

494
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:06,760
Agent Park, may I?

495
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,231
Agent Stoller,
this is Jack Bauer.

496
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:12,131
Is Galvez with someone?

497
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:13,402
Agent Stoller?

498
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:15,701
Negative. He's alone.

499
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:18,771
Copy that.

500
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,211
What's his 20?

501
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:24,881
Entering an abandoned apartment
building on the south side

502
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:26,753
of Rincon and 12th.

503
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:27,570
I am in pursuit.

504
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,883
Try to maintain a visual
and wait for backup.

505
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:31,351
Do not engage
until we get there.

506
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,023
Copy that.

507
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:35,820
PARK: All primary units
respond to 12th and Rincon.

508
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:38,462
Suspect sighted entering
a building with canister.

509
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:40,503
Code Yellow. Agent Park?
I want a secure net

510
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:43,230
around the building,
agents at all exits and I want

511
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,472
sharpshooters covering each
of the four exposures.

512
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,443
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:48,873
Jack.

514
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:51,573
I can't.

515
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:57,150
It's all right, I'll be fine.

516
00:28:57,316 --> 00:28:58,851
I'll stay back,
I'll watch operations.

517
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:00,780
You be careful out there.

518
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:02,821
I still think Galvez
has a partner.

519
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,991
You watch your back.

520
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:02,691
"Hellfire." You served
with the 27th in Pakistan.

521
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:04,523
Two tours, sir.

522
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:07,921
Did you, by any chance,
encounter any Starkwood units?

523
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:13,001
There was a force protection
team attached by my C.O.

524
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,131
They fought with you.

525
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes, sir.

526
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:17,873
Side by side.

527
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:19,070
Soldier...

528
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:24,173
How would you rate
their professionalism?

529
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:25,643
Their performance under fire.

530
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:33,021
Thank you, son.

531
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:34,652
Just made my day.

532
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,071
All right, let's go.

533
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:07,880
Our orders are to deliver the
prisoner to the rear entrance at FBI.

534
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:11,073
The White House wants
to keep this low-key.

535
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:49,230
Sarge!

536
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:03,141
This is Sergeant Cadden.

537
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:06,241
Prisoner's in severe cardiac
and respiratory distress.

538
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:10,382
We are rerouting to West
Arlington Hospital.

539
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:13,352
Need emergency medical
team standing by!

540
00:32:14,028 --> 00:32:15,050
Go, go!

541
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:29,550
Assemble the teams. You got it.

542
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:31,630
Agent Stoller,
this is Agent Walker, do you copy?

543
00:32:31,737 --> 00:32:32,733
I copy you, Agent Walker.

544
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:33,943
What is your position?

545
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:37,342
East stairwell between the
first and second floor.

546
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:39,583
Suspect with canister has
moved to the top floor.

547
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:42,082
Do you have any indication
that he's not alone?

548
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,512
Negative. Not at this time.

549
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:45,410
All right, stand by.
We're coming to you.

550
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:48,080
Agent Stoller puts the suspect
somewhere on the second floor.

551
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,422
However, there's no guarantee that
he's the only hostile in the building.

552
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,601
Therefore, we stick to SOP,
clearing room by room.

553
00:32:53,768 --> 00:32:55,762
Agent Park and I will lead two teams,
East and West.

554
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,091
Check your weapons
and headsets.

555
00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:58,081
We move in 60 seconds.

556
00:32:58,258 --> 00:33:00,592
All right, you heard her,
you guys are with me...

557
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:01,661
Mobile Command, this is Walker.

558
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:02,970
Go ahead, Agent Walker.

559
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:04,500
We're about to
enter the building.

560
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,902
Have HazMat teams on alert,
in case the canister gets breached.

561
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:08,143
Copy that.

562
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:09,271
How you holding up?

563
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,642
Better, thanks.

564
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,522
Excuse me.

565
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:21,722
This is Bauer.

566
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:23,721
Mr. Bauer,
this is Agent Mizelli.

567
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:25,090
Sorry to bother you with this,

568
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:27,122
but I need to follow up on
something from our debrief.

569
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:28,493
Agent, this isn't a good time.

570
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:30,793
Some new information has come to light,
and I need

571
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,033
to clear up a discrepancy.
What discrepancy?

572
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,401
You told me Tony Almeida's
source on the White House attack

573
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:39,001
was a man identified to
you as Vincent Cardiff?

574
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:40,240
Yeah, that's right.

575
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:43,170
Is there a possibility you
misremembered the name?

576
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:44,210
No, I don't think so.

577
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:45,083
Are you sure?

578
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:47,581
You yourself have voiced some
concern about your own acuity.

579
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:49,212
Hold on.

580
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:50,213
What is this here?

581
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:51,382
Sir?

582
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:54,081
Agent Mizelli, I'm gonna have to
get back to you. Locator codes

583
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:55,783
for all units'
radio transponders.

584
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:57,240
Are they in real time?
Yes, sir.

585
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,421
Can you do a map overlay?

586
00:33:58,527 --> 00:33:59,521
It'll take a minute.
Get it done.

587
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:01,490
What's going on, Jack?

588
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:04,292
I'm not sure yet.

589
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:27,852
Ready? Now.

590
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,002
Right there,
there's Stoller's transponder.

591
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:50,313
He's not even in the building.

592
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:51,742
Agent Walker, this is Jack.

593
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:53,142
Get your men out
of the building.

594
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:54,542
It's a trap. Jack, what?

595
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:57,451
Stoller's not even in there.
Get your men out now.

596
00:34:57,616 --> 00:34:58,581
<i>RENEE: Code Blue.</i>

597
00:34:58,755 --> 00:35:00,353
Repeat: Code Blue.

598
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:17,133
Agent Walker, Agent Park!

599
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:18,332
Get us a vehicle now!

600
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:19,903
All perimeter teams,
this is Park.

601
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,742
Agents are down.
Report to 12th and Rincon.

602
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:23,682
We need assistance.

603
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,541
Negative, negative,
disregard that order.

604
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:26,570
Maintain your positions.

605
00:35:26,687 --> 00:35:28,053
I repeat,
maintain your positions.

606
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:29,613
Bauer, what the
hell are you doing?

607
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:31,352
They are trying to
pull you off the line.

608
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:34,082
You leave a hole in that perimeter,
we are going to lose the canister.

609
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:35,381
Tell your men to stand fast.

610
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:36,491
Medivac is on its way.

611
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:38,150
Get them in the air now!

612
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:13,213
Jack, I'm going in.

613
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:14,242
Agent Park.

614
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:15,243
Agent Park.

615
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,580
How many men are unaccounted for?
Still assessing.

616
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:20,020
There were at least 30 of us in the
building when it went up.

617
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:23,153
- And Agent Walker?
- I don't know.

618
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:25,153
Renee, this is Jack.

619
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:26,660
Do you copy?

620
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:27,662
Renee, this is Jack.

621
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:30,390
Do you copy?

622
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:33,030
Damn it.

623
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:41,103
Almeida.

624
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:44,771
You got the canister?

625
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:45,770
Yeah.

626
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:46,940
Let me see.

627
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,280
Hurry up,
we need to get moving.

628
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:04,862
Let's go.

629
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:07,032
Renee!

630
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:17,370
Renee...

631
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:19,111
Renee! Jack.

632
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:21,943
Are you okay?

633
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,982
Yeah, but he's not breathing.

634
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:25,251
We need a medic!

635
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:32,450
They've got him.
I want to get you out of here.

636
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,021
Come on, let's go now.

637
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:42,363
How'd you know it was a trap?

638
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:44,542
Stoller's transponder was
outside of the building.

639
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:47,103
They were trying to thin our ranks,
create a diversion.

640
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:48,202
Has the cordon been breached?

641
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,942
No, I told the men to
maintain their positions.

642
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:50,972
The perimeter's secure.

643
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:52,272
It's almost like
they knew, Jack.

644
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:54,511
They would have needed time to wire
this building with explosives.

645
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:56,480
This was the last sector
we were due to search.

646
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:59,712
You think they knew your sweep patterns?
They must have.

647
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:01,583
Oh, my God.

648
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:02,720
Jack, what is it?

649
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:06,322
I'll meet you back
at your vehicle.

650
00:38:07,698 --> 00:38:09,491
Hey, you want me to take him?

651
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:10,563
No, I got him.

652
00:38:10,736 --> 00:38:13,031
They need your help inside.

653
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,872
Agent Mizelli.

654
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:22,203
This is Bauer.
You said you wanted to talk to me

655
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,271
about Tony's suspect
Vincent Cardiff.

656
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:26,111
Yes, yes,
thanks for getting back to me.

657
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:27,780
Listen, uh,
you told me that he expired

658
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,940
during the course of Tony
Almeida's interrogation.

659
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:31,711
Yeah, that's what Tony told me.

660
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:32,773
Well, it can't be him.

661
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:34,122
What are you talking about?

662
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,483
Vincent Cardiff was picked up
over an hour ago by Customs,

663
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:37,921
trying to cross the
border into Canada.

664
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:38,890
Are you sure?

665
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,360
Look, I'm positive,
I've got his arrest report right here.

666
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:42,920
Cardiff's alive.

667
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:44,902
Were there any signs
from his interrogation--

668
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,932
physical violence,
abuse, anything at all?

669
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:48,200
Nothing's indicated
on the report.

670
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:51,632
That's why I was asking if maybe you
had mistaken the name Almeida gave you.

671
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:01,643
Here you go.

672
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:03,213
Thanks.

673
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:06,010
Tony!

674
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,592
Tony!

675
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:14,893
Yeah.

676
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:19,733
We need to talk.

677
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,203
Sure.

678
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:24,603
What's going on?

679
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:32,071
I told you earlier today, if you were
lying to me I'd kill you myself.

680
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,111
What the hell are
you talking about?

681
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:37,380
Cardiff, Vincent Cardiff-- you said he
was killed during his interrogation.

682
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:38,410
Yeah, so?

683
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:42,882
He's alive and well, in custody, and
he's showing no signs of physical abuse.

684
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,020
Explain that.

685
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:48,162
All right, look,
Jack, I'm sorry.

686
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:51,590
Cardiff knew that by spilling that
intel, he was going to get killed,

687
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:53,033
so I cut a deal with him.

688
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,261
I told him I'd
let the FBI think

689
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,400
he was dead,
so he could walk away and disappear.

690
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,633
I thought it was just
a meaningless lie.

691
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,803
You and I have been doing
this long enough to know

692
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:03,943
that there is no such
thing as a meaningless lie.

693
00:40:04,116 --> 00:40:05,311
How are you involved in this?

694
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:06,543
You're not making
any sense, Jack.

695
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:07,452
That intel was good.

696
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,483
Without it you'd have never been in
the White House to save the president.

697
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:11,810
What is your involvement?!

698
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,821
You're not thinking straight.

699
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,893
How were you shot?

700
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:19,490
Does Galvez even
have a second man...

701
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:20,431
or was it just you?

702
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:22,592
Just stop and listen
to what you're saying.

703
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:24,462
It's insane. It's paranoia.

704
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,301
Now, why don't you
put the gun down?

705
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,863
Don't you move!

706
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:31,301
The toxin is starting to
affect your judgment.

707
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:34,002
That's what's happening.
You can see that, right?

708
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:54,360
Is this what you're
looking for?

709
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:59,263
I never wanted to
hurt you, Jack.

710
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,403
I told you to stay out of it.

711
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:04,232
But you wouldn't listen,
would you?

712
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:07,873
Can we get some help here?
This man's having a seizure.

713
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:11,610
Stand back, please.

714
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:14,012
Go get my bag and call Dr.
Mason, stat.

715
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:54,082
I don't see anything.

716
00:41:54,256 --> 00:41:55,720
The wound must be posterior.

717
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:58,692
Sir, I need to turn
you on your side.

718
00:42:08,368 --> 00:42:10,761
Put it down and
keep driving. Now!

719
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,573
Put it down and
keep driving. Now!
