*******

4
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,610
put the phone away.

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,710
Uh, one more minute.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,510
That's what you said five
minutes ago. Now, put it away.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,040
Dad...

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,210
I got you the phone
for emgencies, honey.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,450
Well, this is an emergency.

10
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:38,930
Fine.

11
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:44,265
wait, now, how come you get to
talk on the phone? That's not fair.

12
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:46,777
Life's not fair. Hello.

13
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:51,203
Hello? Who is this?

14
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:02,730
emily? Are you okay?

15
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:12,060

16
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,592
everybody...

00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:25,373
Dad... dad... Dad... dad! Dad!

18
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,351

Emily! Emily!

00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,360
Go! Get in there!

22
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,662
- Daddy!
- Let's go!

23
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:50,740
please don't hurt my daughter.

24
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,362
I've got money.

25
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:55,090
We don't want your money, mr. Latham.

26
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:58,103
We just need you to
fix something for us.

29
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,882
Let the record show this is the
third day of this senate hearing

30
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:17,111
investigating human rights violations by the
recently disbanded counter terrorist unit.

31
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:22,250
Yesterday, when we adjourned, we
were discussing brutality and torture

32
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:26,520
by ctu agents in the
course of their operations.

33
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:29,782
Will the witness please state his name?

34
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,292
Jack bauer.

35
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:35,300
Mr. Bauer, I don't see
your counsel present.

36
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:38,553
Is he or she not aware
that we're about to start?

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,180
I have chosen not to retain counsel.

38
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:47,172
Mr. Bauer, I have to advise you
that many of the questions that

39
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:49,702
we' about to pose to
you are of a legal nature

40
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:53,071
and might result in answers
that could incriminate you.

41
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,572
I understand that, senator.

42
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:59,892
We can postpone your testimony until this
afternoon if you'd like to bring in representation--

43
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,230
something that I would strongly advise.

44
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:06,240
What is the first question, senator?

45
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:12,052
All right, then. Let's begin.

46
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:16,992
Mr. Bauer, who is ibrahim hadad?

47
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,493
That information is classified.

48
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,341
We represent the people
of the united states,

49
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:26,483
and we have declassified
those files on their behalf.

50
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:32,080
Now, I'm going to ask you one
more time: Who is ibrahim hadad?

51
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:40,191
He was a member of a terrorist sleeper
cell ctu had under surveillance in 2002.

52
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:45,302
And isn't it true that you detained
mr. Hadad without due process,

53
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:50,542
and that you used extreme
interrogation methods on him

54
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:53,012
until he answered your questions?

55
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,781
Yes, sir.

56
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:58,520
Would you say that you broke
procedure with this interrogation?

57
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:01,430
- Probably.
- Probably?

58
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:05,972
Well, that's A... very cavalier answer.

59
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:08,910
You don't seem to care
about the implications here.

60
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,532
Well, mr. Bauer?

61
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:17,661
I'm sorry, senator. I
didn't hear a question.

62
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,581
All right, then.

63
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:24,691
Did you torture mr. Hadad?

64
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:30,661
According to the definitions set forth
by the geneva convention, yes, I did.

65
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:33,243
Senator, why don't I save you some time.

66
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:38,191
It's obvious that your agenda is to discredit
ctu and generate a series of indictments.

67
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:40,780
My only agenda is to get to the truth.

68
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:42,960
I don't think it is, sir.

69
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:44,290
Excuse me?

70
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:49,362
Ibrahim hadad had targeted a bus carrying
45 people, ten of which were children.

71
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:52,851
The truth, senator, is I stopped
that attack from happening.

72
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:54,351
By torturing mr. Hadad.

73
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:57,632
By doing what I deemed necessary
to protect innocent lives.

74
00:04:57,657 --> 00:05:00,730
So, basically, what
you're saying, mr. Bauer,

75
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:04,570
is that the ends justify the means,
and that you are above the law.

76
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:07,821
When I am activated, when I am brought
into a situation, there is a reason.

77
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:11,651
And that reason is to complete the
objectives of my mission at all costs.

78
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:14,672
Even if it means breaking the law?

79
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,833
For a combat soldier, the difference
between success and failure

80
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,770
is your ability to adapt to your enemy.

81
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,683
The people that I deal with--
they don't care about your rules.

82
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:26,292
All they care about is a result.

83
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:29,483
My job is to stop them from
accomplishing their objectives.

84
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:32,021
I simply adapted.

85
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:36,063
In answer to your question,
am I above the law? No, sir.

86
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:40,283
I am more than willing to be judged
by the people you claim to represent.

87
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:43,603
I will let them decide
what price I should pay.

88
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:46,423
But please do not sit there
with that smug look on your face

89
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,791
and expect me to regret the
decisions that I have made,

90
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:54,170
because, sir, the truth is, I don'T.

91
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:57,550
Excuse me, sir.

92
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:13,602
sorry for interrupting, senator.
I'm renee walker with the fbi.

93
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:15,131
We have a subpoena for jack bauer.

94
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,520
I need him remanded into
my custody immediately.

95
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,353
I'm not surprised that anyone
has a subpoena for mr. Bauer,

96
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:23,993
but right now, you're going
to have to wait your turn.

97
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,790
He's being questioned by
the united states senate.

98
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:29,240
Sir, we need mr. Bauer immediately.

99
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:43,993
Well, apparently, we're going
to have to let you go for w,

100
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,522
but we're not done with you.

101
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:50,142
We'll reconvene with you tomorrow morning
at the same time. Is that understood?

102
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:51,730
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:54,662
All right. Then you go
along with these agents.

104
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:11,411
Well, let's proceed.

105
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,573
Bailiff, call the next witness.

106
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,310
What is this about?

107
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,480
Mr. Bauer, I'm special agent
walker. This is agent teller.

108
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,943
We need you to come
with us to our office.

109
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,260
- It's just down the block.
- Why?

110
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,731
You'll be briefed when we get there.

111
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:30,371
- Hello?
- Janis, it's me. Where's larry?

112
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:32,263
He's briefing dornan's group.

113
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:34,510
Tell him I've got bauer,
we're leaving the hearing now.

114
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:36,790
Well, that's good, 'cause
the situation's heating up.

115
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:37,790
What are you talking about?

116
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,293
That crew we've been tracking?

117
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,293
They just grabbed a man
named michael latham.

118
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:45,030
Latham? He worked on
homeland's firewall project.

119
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:47,093
Oh, he didn't just work
on it, he designed it.

120
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:51,062
He's the chief engineer of the
government's infrastructure security system.

121
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:53,643
All right, I'll be there soon.

122
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:58,690
Did you get bauer cleared
through security yet?

123
00:07:58,715 --> 00:07:59,491
Not yet.

124
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:02,193
Well, renee's bringing him in.
They're only a couple minutes out.

125
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,691
Then you won't need him
cleared for a couple of minutes.

126
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:08,673
- Sean, as a friend, I'd like to keep...
- you're not my friend.

127
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:10,062
Sure.

128
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:13,871
As someone as close to a friend as you are
ever going to get, let me give you some advice.

129
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:16,752
Most people don't like sarcasm.

130
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:19,193
I myself have no problem
with it, 'cause I'm cheerful.

131
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:21,380
I'm a cheerful person.

132
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:23,630
You're a cheerful person?

133
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:27,383
Just get bauer cleared.

134
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:31,933
For the past eight weeks, this office has been
investigating a series of technology thefts--

135
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:35,730
software, custom gate array
chips, neural networks.

136
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,673
Forensics concluded that the break-ins
were the work of the same crew,

137
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:42,810
but we didn't know what
their end game was until now.

138
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,462
This is michael latham.

139
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:51,551
He's chief engineer on the classified
infrastructure portal, homeland's firewall project.

140
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:55,721
He was abducted ten minutes ago by the
same group behind the technology thefts.

141
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:58,370
You think they're using this guy
latham to get through the cip firewall?

142
00:08:58,386 --> 00:08:59,310
That's our concern.

143
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:01,840
The hardware they stole could be used
to build a device to do just that.

144
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:04,535
And latham's one of the
few people that could do it.

145
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,427
We assume he's being forced to work on
the device, or that he's already dead.

146
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:11,053
Excuse me-- renee's on
her way in with jack bauer.

147
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:12,903
Thank you.

148
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:16,881
We've tasked your people to help this
investigation. See sean. He's got the packets.

149
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:19,061
We're on it.

150
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,583
we're on line with gsa 117.

151
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:29,702
How many systems?

152
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:32,170
Communications, navigation...

153
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:36,002
but we need the other systems
working. Check on latham.

154
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:01,140
all right... it's done.

155
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,780
northeast three, this
is global skies 117.

156
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,932
We are ready for clearance.

157
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,532
Gsa 117, roger.

158
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,521
You're clear to jfk airport as filed.

159
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,081
Maintain 5,000.

160
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,410
Expect flight level of 280
ten minutes after departure.

161
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:22,810
Cleared to jfk. Expect flight level 280.

162
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:29,762
Welcome to global skies flight number 117,
passenger service from reagan-national to jfk.

163
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:32,472
Weather in new york is cloudy
with a chance of thunder showers,

164
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:35,962
so we may run into some
turbulence along the way.

165
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:42,243
Tower to skies, awaiting
traffic off of dulles.

166
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,122
Position hold, gsa 117.

167
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,121
Gsa 117, that's correct.

168
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,961
mr. Bauer?

169
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:08,663
I'm agent larry moss. I'm
the head of this office.

170
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:13,120
You're here because agent walker thinks you
might be able to help us with an investigation.

171
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:19,252
Now, personally, I have my doubts,
but I'll be happy to be proven wrong.

172
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,011
Well, cky for me, I'm not here
to apply for a job, agent moss.

173
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:26,390
Personally, I don't care what makes you
happy, so let's just get this over with.

174
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:30,713
Take him to renee's office.

175
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:38,031
Do you want me in the room with you?

176
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,271
- No.
- Renee...

177
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,371
you've read his file.

178
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:46,643
Bauer's the kind of guy you say
the wrong thing, he can go off.

179
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,021
I'll be fine, larry.

180
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,071
If he goes off, I'll call you.

181
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:56,483
All right, but if he doesn't produce,
don't waste our time. Throw him back.

182
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,593
What do you want?

183
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:05,732
Mr. Bauer, we have a national
security matter that has gone critical.

184
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,222
I'm hoping you can help us with it.

185
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:11,442
Please sit down.

186
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:20,890
I sent the differentials to homeland.

187
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:26,100
Was there anything else
you needed me to do?

188
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:27,901
No.

189
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,393
Has bauer been indicted yet?

190
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,982
No, but he will be after
the senate hearings.

191
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:38,113
The cip firewall protects every major
infrastructure system in this country--

192
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:41,842
if it were breached, telecommunication,
transportation, power grids--

193
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,792
they would all be vulnerable.

194
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,983
- Agent walker, right?
- Yes.

195
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm not active.

196
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:50,440
The doj is about to file
criminal charges against me;

197
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,111
I'm not exactly in a position
to help you with your situation.

198
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:56,641
As much as I understand
how dire it is...

199
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:59,970
no, I don't think you do.

200
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,131
One of the men behind this threat...

201
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:08,193
is someone you know.

202
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:29,421
That's not possible.

203
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,883
Tony almeida is dead.

204
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:34,513
- Apparently not.
- I was there when he died.

205
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:37,071
And he was rushed away by
the emts a minute later.

206
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:42,133
You never saw him after that, and hours later
you were abducted by the chinese government.

207
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:51,250
No. No.

208
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,962
If tony were still alive, I would
know. He would have contacted me.

209
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:59,913
We recovered this image from a security camera
where one of the technology thefts took place.

210
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,850
It's time-stamped and dated.

211
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:07,262
Images can be manipulated.

212
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,532
Not this one.

213
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:16,681
I'm sorry, I don't believe it.

214
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:21,940
I had almeida's grave exhumed.

215
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:30,702
Dna tests confirmed that it was
not his body that was buried.

216
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,600
The evidence is right here.

217
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:37,743
If you want to leave without
looking at it, go ahead.

218
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,130
Gsa 117 on a roll.

219
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,630
Masters?

220
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:09,200
Yes,sir.

221
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,242
Are we in their system?

222
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:14,772
Yes.

223
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:42,931
Roger tower,gsa 117,switching
to departure 126.8

224
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:44,393
Have a good day.

225
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:45,433
What's the problem?

226
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:48,530
The cip module--
it stopped working.

227
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,992
What do you mean it stopped?

228
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:54,002
It keeps going out of phase.

229
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,932
I thought latham said it was good to go.

230
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:58,823
Well,it's not.

231
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,492
All right,let me have it.

232
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,923
So what did you do?

233
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:23,933
I didn't do anything.

234
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,243
I swear.

235
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:27,362
Then why isn't it working?

236
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,351
I don't know.

237
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:30,953
Fix it.

238
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:32,883
Now.

239
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:43,581
you're gonna want to
move faster than that.

240
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:49,902
See,'cause if you can't make this work in
the next few minutes,I won't need you anymore.

241
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:52,113
You understand what that means?

242
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,560
Good.

243
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,200
Now fix it.

244
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:17,042
Officials say that an estimated 300,000
civilians-- men,women,and children--

245
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:22,371
have been killed as part of general
benjamin juma's campaign of ethnic cleansing.

246
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:24,993
Survivors in the african
nation of sangala,

247
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:29,782
believe american intervention is
necessary to prevent further bloodshed.

248
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:32,712
The white house has made
no public statements...

249
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:36,900
juma's perpetrating the worst mass
murder africa has seen since rwanda.

250
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:37,852
But if you read the columns...

251
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:38,611
I do.

252
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,220
Half of them are against
our taking action.

253
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:42,451
But if we don'T...

254
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:48,063
six months from now,those same members of the
press will be accusing us of moral bankruptcy.

255
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:49,920
We can always revisit the un option.

256
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:55,141
The un's paralyzed,ethan,while people
are being butchered by that madman.

257
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:56,861
We have to lead.

258
00:17:56,895 --> 00:18:00,101
Even if it means going it alone.

259
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:04,683
I'm not gonna have hundreds of
thousands of lives on my conscience.

260
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:07,441
General juma has to be stopped.

261
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:09,243
He will be,madame president.

262
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:11,581
As soon as you give the order.

263
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,342
Are the joint chiefs here yet?

264
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:14,553
They're gathering in the situation room.

265
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:17,120
They'll call as soon as
they're ready for you.

266
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:20,052
I just heard kevin aldrich
is doing a piece for cnb.

267
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:23,190
He's still pressing his case
against sending our troops in.

268
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,610
As if getting through this
day won't be hard enough.

269
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:29,261
If you want,I can sit down with him and try
to get him to hold off; he's in the press room.

270
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,121
I'm not sure that's a good idea,henry.

271
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:35,851
This is the last thing you need right
now,especially with public opinion so split.

272
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:47,171
if you think you can
talk aldrich down,do it.

273
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:50,963
Madame president,the
joint chiefs are ready.

274
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:54,853
Here's your briefing package.

275
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,332
Wish me luck.

276
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,072
Good luck.

277
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:15,023
Is this everything?

278
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:16,620
It's all there.

279
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,470
I don't mean to sound
like a broken record,

280
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:30,762
but I'm not sure your husband
is up to handling aldrich.

281
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,072
Henry's fine.

282
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:33,723
He's better,I realize that,but...

283
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:36,892
it's going to take
more than a few months.

284
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:38,432
He lost a son.

285
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:40,403
So did you.

286
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:44,981
And you haven't let your
loss interfere with your job.

287
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:55,740
Your husband is a strong man,but
he doesn't have your resilience.

288
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:58,931
It's not a matter of resilience,ethan.

289
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:05,002
There's not a day that goes by,not a
moment when i don't think about my son.

290
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:12,261
But I'm about to take this nation to war and
grief is a luxury I can't afford right now.

291
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:29,340
Before we begin,let me thank each of you for
the time and work you've put into this operation.

292
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:35,170
Putting american lives at risk is the
hardest decision I've ever had to make...

293
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:39,023
but it is one that has to be made.

294
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,953
what was that?

295
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,673
It's working.

296
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:48,450
What was wrong?

297
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:52,080
It was overheating. I
came up with a workaround.

298
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,382
Try it now.

299
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:18,670
There.

300
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:19,493
Yeah.

301
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:21,290
It's transmitting again.

302
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:24,250
We can send and receive.

303
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:29,872
Double a-123 maintain course.

304
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,033
What was that?

305
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,732
I just got it,too.

306
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,591
Did you guys lose synch?

307
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,920
Yeah. I did,but we're back up now.

308
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:41,943
Anybody else lose synch?

309
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:42,760
No,I'm good.

310
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,461
No,I'm fine.

311
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,821
What's going on,phil?

312
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:50,102
This is gonna sound crazy,but the three
of us just got bumped for a second.

313
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:52,483
But the log file doesn't
show a power surge.

314
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:54,980
This came from the system kernel.

315
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:56,791
What are you talking about?

316
00:21:56,825 --> 00:21:58,711
The kernel's protected.

317
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,500
Let me have a look.

318
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:09,530
All we know for sure is that almeida is part of a homegrown
terrorist group that's targeting our infrastructure.

319
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:11,560
He could be working undercover,some
kind of sting operation.

320
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,032
You need to check
every federal agency--

321
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,422
we have. State and city,too.

322
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,070
Almeida's not working for any of them.

323
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:17,191
Then there must be
some other explanation.

324
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:18,533
Yeah,there is.

325
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:23,661
His wife was brutally murdered by a faction operating
inside the government,led by the president himself.

326
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:26,771
Everybody involved in that is
either in prison or has been killed.

327
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:30,071
The government gave president logan a
slap on the wrist,they cut him a deal.

328
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,391
Sentencing him to house arrest
on a hundred-acre ranch...

329
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,960
And you think tony's looking for
justice by attacking this country?

330
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:40,831
Almeida lost everything he had,and he's blaming
it on the government he spent his life serving.

331
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:49,123
But you'd know better
than me how that feels...

332
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,402
how far a man might go.

333
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,332
Not that far.

334
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,371
And not tony almeida.

335
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,562
There's a logical explanation for this.

336
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,183
It's just something you're not seeing.

337
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:06,180
Help me find almeida and
you can ask him yourself.

338
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:08,903
You know how he thinks.

339
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:10,011
You had the same training.

340
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:12,822
You know the same people.

341
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,563
I'm going to need complete access
to all of your source material--

342
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,210
everything you've got on this.

343
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:24,691
yes?

344
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,353
Renee,come out here.
Something just came in.

345
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:27,350
Be right there.

346
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,752
Everything we have on almeida's
crew is in this directory.

347
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,220
Start here...

348
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:33,943
I'll be right back.

349
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:43,262
What's going on?

350
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:44,990
Northeast air traffic
control just called.

351
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:47,970
They reported a possible intrusion
into their communication systems.

352
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:48,881
It just happened.

353
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:49,932
Can th source them?

354
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:52,310
They're trying,but so far,nothing.

355
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:54,351
Why do we think this has
to do with almeida's crew?

356
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:57,133
I don't think you get intrusions
like this unless someone's driving it,

357
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:00,671
and the only way to drive it
is through the cip firewall.

358
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,710
So they're going after
air traffic control.

359
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,643
That's what it looks like.

360
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,221
Put me through to the white house.

361
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:12,892
You doing a turnaround in new york?

362
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:15,201
Nope. Got two days off.

363
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,742
I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city.

364
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:19,990
Oh,that'll be fun.

365
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:29,760
well,doug said we were
going to hit some weather.

366
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:38,811
I'm going to need tech support
to cross-reference your files.

367
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:40,783
You'll be working with one
of my analysts,sean hillinger.

368
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,011
He can get you whatever files
you need to help us find almeida.

369
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:43,793
Good.

370
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,340
They raise the threat level yet?

371
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:48,551
yeah. We think almeida's gup
got into air traffic control.

372
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:49,272
What?

373
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:50,591
That doesn't make sense.

374
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:51,900
I don't need you to figure it out,jack.

375
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:53,372
Just help me find him.

376
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:54,900
Sean,this is jack bauer.

377
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,432
He's going to be working
with the almeida files.

378
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,460
Give him whatever he needs.

379
00:24:57,486 --> 00:24:59,173
What about interfacing with faa?

380
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:00,942
Janis is working with some
of dornan's people on that.

381
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:02,070
You just help jack.

382
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:03,260
Fine.

383
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,213
I'll check in.

384
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:05,720
Thanks.

385
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,493
What do you want to see?

386
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:08,802
Let's start with the technology thefts.

387
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:10,140
How many were there?

388
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:11,193
Six.

389
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:13,802
Let's run a comp on all of them.

390
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,832
Fantastic.

391
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:22,981
The expeditionary strike force and
its carrier air wing are now on scene.

392
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:26,173
This gives us full spectrum
dominance of the battle space.

393
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:29,871
What kind of resistance are you
anticipating from juma's military?

394
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:31,480
Minimal.

395
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,550
Our air strikes will take out
whatever defenses they've got.

396
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:37,193
We can expect an open
path to juma's front door.

397
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:38,582
Good.

398
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:41,232
All we need to launch
is a go order from you.

399
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:45,961
You'll get a green light as soon as I've gone
over secretary stevens' post-invasion report,

400
00:25:45,997 --> 00:25:47,783
which I'm still waiting for.

401
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:50,640
I'll have it for you
in a few minutes,ma'am.

402
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:54,672
Unless there's a problem
you'd like to discuss.

403
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:58,902
Madame president,my objection to this
operation isn't a secret to anyone in this room.

404
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:01,711
For us to be wading into the middle of another
civil conflict halfway around the world...

405
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,152
we're done debating this,joe.

406
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,073
The un's been issuing
reprimands and economic sanctions

407
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:11,162
while benjamin juma has slaughtered
over 200,000 of his own people.

408
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:15,311
That number will continue to
grow if we don't stop him now.

409
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:20,433
And if you can't get behind what we're
doing,I'll find a secretary of state who can.

410
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:23,831
But I am done with your handwringing.

411
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:26,111
Excuse me,madame president.

412
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:29,243
Tim woods from homeland
security is outside.

413
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:31,392
He needs to see you on another matter.

414
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,403
Can it wait?

415
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:34,561
No,ma'am,it can'T.

416
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:36,382
All right.

417
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:38,551
We'll continue when I return.

418
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:43,863
And,joe,I want that report in
front of me when I get back.

419
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:53,111
What is it?

420
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:56,103
I don't have the details,but it
involves a potential domestic breach.

421
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:57,353
Tim is here to fill us in.

422
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:58,230
Madame president.

423
00:26:58,256 --> 00:27:00,991
Tim,make this brief; the
joint chiefs are waiting.

424
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:03,483
We've been working with the
fbi the last eight weeks,

425
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:05,970
investigating a series
of technology thefts.

426
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:08,403
We didn't understand the
implications of this until today.

427
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:11,712
The same people behind these thefts
abducted a man named michael latham.

428
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:15,130
He's one of the chief engineers in charge
of protecting critical infrastructure.

429
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:16,760
Now,tell me what we're dealing with.

430
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:22,960
The fbi thinks these same people have forced latham
to create a device to hack through the cip firewall.

431
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:27,930
The firewall protects all national
systems: Energy,utilities,transportation...

432
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:34,332
I'm here because the faa reported some
irregularities in their air traffic control system.

433
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:37,580
Are you saying commercial
flights are in danger?

434
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,533
Possibly.

435
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:42,440
Do I need to give the
order to ground air traffic?

436
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,290
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

437
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:47,513
Right now,there are more than 3,000
flights over the continental united states.

438
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:52,523
To ground them all would take 12
hours,minimum,and it could create a panic.

439
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,610
Then what do you recommend?

440
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:57,980
Let us quietly decrease air traffic
while the bureau works their leads.

441
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:01,260
We'll make sure you're
briefed on a real-time basis.

442
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,753
I don't like the timing of this...

443
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:04,680
timing?

444
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:07,641
Could this be connected to
our intervention in sangala?

445
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,643
The fbi hasn't found any connection.

446
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:12,420
All the evidence suggests that we're
dealing with a domestic terror group,

447
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:15,112
homegrown,with a
strong,anti-government bias.

448
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:16,532
And these leads
you mentioned--

449
00:28:16,587 --> 00:28:20,852
do you think you'll be able to catch these
people before they do any real damage?

450
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:24,380
The bureau's got everyone on it,ma'am.

451
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,190
You didn't answer my question.

452
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:28,253
No,ma'am. I didn'T.

453
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:44,343
Of course,I don't condone
what juma's doing over there.

454
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:46,380
But tribal wars are being
fought all over the world.

455
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:48,520
Why not intervene in thailand,malaysia?

456
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:50,333
This isn't a tribal war,kevin.

457
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,763
It's a genocide.

458
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,341
Ending it is the moral obligation
of a nation as powerful as ours.

459
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:59,241
That's a lofty aspiration,but
the reality is a lot more complex.

460
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:02,110
The president's going into
this with both eyes open.

461
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:05,750
How can she be sure thcycle of violence
won't coinue after juma's been taken out?

462
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:09,140
Could be stuck there
indefinitely...keeping the peace.

463
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:15,990
If I gave you an exclusive preview of the president's
post-invasion plans,you might change your mind.

464
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:18,201
You're trying to bribe
me with an exclusive?

465
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:20,861
I'm trying to get you
to give us some rope.

466
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:25,052
What are you asking me to do,stop
writing or write what I don't believe?

467
00:29:25,075 --> 00:29:27,962
Either one would be fine with me.

468
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,261
Sir,you have a phone
call on your private line.

469
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:37,562
Could you excuse me for
a moment,please,kevin.

470
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:47,462
It's chuck toland,sir.

471
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,300
Wait.

472
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:52,683
Chuck,did you find something?

473
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:54,642
I did,but don't get carried away.

474
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:57,120
It doesn't confirm your
theory about how roger died.

475
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:59,833
But it is suspicious.

476
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:00,753
I'm listening.

477
00:30:00,787 --> 00:30:07,400
His girlfriend samantha received a large lump-sum deposit in an
off-shore bank account about three days after roger's suicide.

478
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,743
You mean his alleged suicide.

479
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,570
Right,sir.

480
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:12,992
Where did the money come from?

481
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:13,782
I couldn't tell.

482
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:15,263
It looks like it's been washed.

483
00:30:15,295 --> 00:30:17,870
There's no readily identifiable source.

484
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:19,770
So...what does this mean?

485
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:23,701
All it means is that she
suddenly came into $400,000.

486
00:30:23,747 --> 00:30:26,902
If we're going to find out anything more,I'm
going to need to talk to her personally.

487
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:29,173
Is that how you want me to handle it?

488
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,632
no, If she's got anything to hide,she's
not going to talk to a private investigator.

489
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,452
I agree.

490
00:30:34,477 --> 00:30:36,792
So how do you want me to proceed?

491
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:38,362
I'll talk to her myself.

492
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:39,860
Is she still at that brokerage firm?

493
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,940
Yeah,uh,sloane kittridge.

494
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:43,480
Good.

495
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:46,821
I'm going to finish up here with aldrich.

496
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:49,632
Then I need you to take me somewhere,and keep it off the manifest.

497
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:51,853
I don't want anyone to know where we're going.

498
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:53,862
-Yes,sir.
-Agent gedge.

499
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:55,551
Yes,sir.

500
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:59,591
You think chuck's taking advantage of me,don't you?

501
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,091
It's not my place to say that,sir.

502
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:03,691
I'm asking you anyway.

503
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:07,861
Sir,the police and fbi have both investigated your son's death.

504
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:12,832
And yes,I believe this pi could be exploiting your grief for personal gain.

505
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:16,552
These so-called leads that he's generating have led nowhere.

506
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,360
My son didn't kill himself.

507
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,692
I'm sure of it.

508
00:31:21,695 --> 00:31:24,102
Yes,sir.

509
00:31:26,945 --> 00:31:29,213
Can you check that socket again,please?

510
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,970
Has faa reported any more anomalies?

511
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:32,093
Not since the first three.

512
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,853
Maybe it was just a glitch?

513
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,852
Or it could have been a ripple caused when they broke through the firewall and entered the system.

514
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:40,910
Well,if they're in the system,I can't see them,and I've checked every elr socket.

515
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,113
Keep looking.

516
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:43,760
Renee...

517
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,923
uh,what's going to happen?

518
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:47,721
What do you mean?

519
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:50,601
If almeida has broken through the firewall then we're screwed,right?

520
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:52,870
I mean,crashing couple planes is really nothing compared to

521
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,630
contaminating the water system or bringing down the power grid...

522
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:57,363
don't think about it,janis.

523
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,653
Just stay tasK.

524
00:32:01,228 --> 00:32:02,441
okay,so...

525
00:32:02,448 --> 00:32:05,713
I will just stay calm,right?

526
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:06,982
Yeah.

527
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:14,481
Pull up the second one.

528
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:15,610
You already looked at it.

529
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:17,823
I want to look at it again,pull it up.

530
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:21,810
Have you found anything?

531
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:25,100
No,we keep looking at the same six forensic reports over and over.

532
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,220
What are you looking for,jack?

533
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:27,460
An entry point.

534
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:28,373
They had access cards.

535
00:32:28,377 --> 00:32:31,361
Yeah,but no one reported their access cards stolen,which means they were forged.

536
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,112
So...

537
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,011
These access cards have individual signatures,making them almost impossible to forge.

538
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:38,302
There's only a couple guys who can do it.

539
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:40,192
Can you access old ctu files?

540
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:41,290
Sure.

541
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:43,453
Pull up august 1999.

542
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:45,551
Code name: Hatteras.

543
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:48,512
Just got a call from homeland.

544
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:50,832
They briefed the president but she's not ready to ground planes yet.

545
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,291
Here you go.Hatteras file.

546
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:56,111
You know,you can hire a $14.00-an-hour data applications geek to do this;

547
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:57,102
you don't need me.

548
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,441
I wouldn't advertise that.

549
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,790
There he is-- gabriel schector.

550
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:02,592
Who is he?

551
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:03,440
He was a supplier.

552
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:05,640
Tony and I used him to buy things off-book.

553
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,363
See if he's in your database.

554
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:11,260
Yeah.He's there.

555
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:13,333
Is he still in los angeles?

556
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:16,960
No.According to this earmark,he came to dc nine weeks ago.

557
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:19,711
The thefts started a week after that.

558
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,560
That's your guy.

559
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:22,593
Do you have an address?

560
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:27,581
He's subletting an office downtown-- 1208 naylor road,suite 630.

561
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:29,442
All right,put a field team together,pick him up.

562
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:31,040
I'll call judge simons,have a warrant ready.

563
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:32,522
That's a mistake.

564
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:33,182
Why?

565
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:35,061
You don't have time to go through the motions with schector--

566
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:39,340
you serve him with a warrant,he'll call his lawyers,he'll stall as long as he needs.

567
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:42,540
So,what's the alternative,jack?

568
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:45,171
Break in and torture the guy,like you used to do?

569
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,512
Isn't that how you ended up in front of a senate sub-committee?

570
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,191
Oh,is this how it starts?

571
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,471
You get in my face,tighten your jaw,then if I say something you don't like,

572
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,380
you slam me against the wall.

573
00:33:57,386 --> 00:34:00,061
You have no idea what I do.

574
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:02,551
And last time I checked,you subpoenaed me.

575
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:04,453
You want my help,you want my advice,take it.

576
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:06,113
You don't,don'T.

577
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:08,413
-I don't care.
-Mr. Bauer...

578
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,110
you said you used to work with this man schector.

579
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:12,540
How well does he know you?

580
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:14,743
He knows me.

581
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:17,562
Larry,can I talk to you for a second?

582
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:30,610
I want to take ber with me.

583
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:31,601
No.

584
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:33,740
Forget it.I'm not letting him put his hands on a suspect.

585
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:35,432
He won't need to put his hands on anybody.

586
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:37,843
My guess is if he's in the room,schector will talk.

587
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:39,062
Renee,you saw what he just...

588
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:41,471
I'm trying to find almeida before it's too late,

589
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:43,763
and schector is our best lead.

590
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:46,141
So you want to intimidate him wi bauer?

591
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:47,991
Schector knows how far bauer might go.

592
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:49,050
Let's use that.

593
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:51,270
Yeah,and if schector doesn't blink,then what?

594
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:52,910
I'll keep bauer on a short leash.

595
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,401
Renee,we're the fbi,not ctu.

596
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:56,693
We honor the law.

597
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:58,152
Even when it's not convenient.

598
00:34:58,155 --> 00:35:00,491
Look,this situation is heating up fast,larry.

599
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,901
The president's into it now,and she's expecting results.

600
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:05,452
Yeah,I know.

601
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:07,312
It's your call.

602
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:11,310
But I promise you,can handle bauer.

603
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:18,990
All right.

604
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:21,191
But I'm holding you responsible.

605
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:23,711
And I'm sending backup teams.

606
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,312
Jack.

607
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:30,932
You're coming with me,and you're doing this my way.

608
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,131
Tell me about schector.

609
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:53,663
Out of san diego,till he went on his own.

610
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:54,443
Legitimate?

611
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:56,343
Yeah,at first,then he got greedy.

612
00:35:56,345 --> 00:36:00,133
Started using his connections to acquire technology,sell it on the gray market.

613
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:01,670
Who'd he sell to,terrorists?

614
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:04,592
No.Usually foreign governments trying to get around treaties.

615
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,471
And how did you and tony get involved with him?

616
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:08,223
We arrested him,we turned him.

617
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:10,331
He was a great conduit for intel.

618
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,643
Ctu didn't mind that you were letting this guy stay in business?

619
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,301
Ctu didn't know.

620
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:16,653
It was just tony and me.

621
00:36:16,656 --> 00:36:18,981
So you and tony were tight?

622
00:36:18,987 --> 00:36:20,633
Yeah...

623
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:23,270
yeah,we were close.

624
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:26,043
All right,so it sounds like tony,who everyone thinks is dead,

625
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,321
puts together a plan to hijack american security.

626
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:30,671
He contacts schector to help him with this plan.

627
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:32,303
Yeah.

628
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,553
Except you don't believe it.

629
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,252
That tony's dirty.

630
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,091
I believe that tony's alive.

631
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,791
And I believe he's doing something dangerous,and that we need to find him.

632
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,062
We confirmed schector's inside.

633
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:05,281
How do you want to handle this?

634
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:06,631
I'm going in with bauer.

635
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:07,621
Alone?

636
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:08,712
I want schector to talk.

637
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:09,682
I don't want to spook him.

638
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,592
Call me when backup gets here.

639
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:20,992
Matobo's fighters are hidden outside the capitol in three camps.

640
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:24,051
Alpha,beta and delta.

641
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:27,420
Our ground forces will join up with them once the air strikes are completed.

642
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:33,253
Make sure general wagner understands our priority is to maintain order in the streets.

643
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:36,540
The people need to see that their country's being governed under the rule of law.

644
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:40,331
What happens when matobo's men execute general juma without a trial?

645
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:43,580
Should we intervene or let the mob tear them apart?

646
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,182
I'm meeting with mr. Matobo in a few minutes.

647
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:51,533
I'll make sure he keeps his men in line.

648
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:55,822
And,joe,I was wrong to dress you down in front of the joint chiefs.

649
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:56,843
I'm sorry.

650
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:58,650
No need to apologize,madame president.

651
00:37:58,657 --> 00:37:59,592
You're under a lot of pressure.

652
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:01,712
That's still no excuse.

653
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:04,403
Thank yo ma'am,I appreciate that.

654
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:08,770
The fact remains,if you can't get behind this operation with both shoulders,

655
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:11,972
I will need your resignation.

656
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:13,701
That won't be necessary,ma'am.

657
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,942
Whatever doubts I have,I'll keep them to myself.

658
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,083
Good.

659
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,832
Excuse me,madame president.

660
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:21,030
What is it,ethan?

661
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:26,640
I thought you'd want to know,henry aldrich has agreed to delay his broadcast for 24 hours.

662
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:28,851
Henry's doing?

663
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,471
I,uh,underestimated him.

664
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,593
Letting him intervene was the right call.

665
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:34,250
Well,that's some good news.

666
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:35,982
What about the firewall situation?

667
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:37,562
Has the fbi made any progress?

668
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,072
They've identified a man who may have information.

669
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:42,753
They're about to question him.

670
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:50,411
It's more than likely schector's not going to give you this information easily.

671
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:53,041
Just remember,this is an fbi operation.

672
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:56,153
We work within the confines of the law.

673
00:38:56,156 --> 00:38:58,330
You can threaten him,but do not lay hands on him.

674
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,693
The minute I see you crossing that line,I will pull you back,understood?

675
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:03,790
Understood.

676
00:39:14,825 --> 00:39:16,483
Agent walker,fbi.

677
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,280
I'm here to talk to gabriel schector.

678
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,940
Just a second.

679
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,603
Can I help you?

680
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:33,571
Jack bauer?

681
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:35,180
How are you,gabe?

682
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:37,112
Didn't know you were fbi.

683
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:38,890
I'm not.

684
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:40,712
Just came along for the ride.

685
00:39:40,718 --> 00:39:42,461
Mr. Bauer is here under my authority.

686
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:48,091
Oh,so I can hold you responsible for anything he does while he's here.

687
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,131
I have a witness.

688
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:51,892
Sure.

689
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,093
Okay.

690
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:57,242
Come on in.

691
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:02,643
Please.

692
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:05,063
Have a seat.

693
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,430
this should be an interesting conversation.

694
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:15,980
How long's it been,jack?

695
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:17,830
Years.

696
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:19,143
How's the,uh...

697
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:21,772
senate thing doing?

698
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:24,481
I hear they dismantled the ctu.

699
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:26,232
Don't tell me.

700
00:40:26,236 --> 00:40:28,140
It was your fault,wasn't it?

701
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:30,493
Mr. Schector,we're not here to make small talk.

702
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:31,712
I have questions.

703
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:34,403
Well,you have my undivided attention.

704
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:35,983
Where's tony almeida?

705
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:37,912
Tony almeida?

706
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:39,831
In the ground,I spose.

707
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,283
Unless he was cremated.

708
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:45,371
Didn't he die at ctu a while back?

709
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,673
You got an out here,gabe.

710
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:49,711
They're not after you.

711
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:51,152
They're willing to accept that you didn't know

712
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:55,223
what tony almeidaas going to do with the components that y helped him steal.

713
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:04,172
Nobody I knew stole anything,and if they did,I knew nothing about it.

714
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:06,941
This is far more serious than you know,mr. Schector.

715
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:10,023
If you help us find almeida,I can see to it that you're kept in the clear.

716
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:15,171
Otherwise,you could be a co-conspirator to multiple terrorist acts.

717
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:19,662
No,well,I think this conversation is over.

718
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:23,022
I tried to answer all your questions honestly,

719
00:41:23,026 --> 00:41:26,543
but I think,from now on,you can speak to my lawyers.

720
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:29,003
So,good-bye,jack.

721
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:30,351
And good luck with the senate.

722
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:32,092
Hope they fry your ass.

723
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:35,572
Ari,could you show these people to the door,please.

724
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:36,993
Are you sure you want to play it like this?

725
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:39,630
Yeah,that's the way I want to play,jack.

726
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:45,592
-Drop your weapon.
-Drop it now!

727
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:48,272
Okay,okay,okay.

728
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,441
You two are going to prison!

729
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:51,751
This was unprovoked!

730
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:52,632
Unprovoked!

731
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:57,023
Your man ari was going for his gun-- I've got a witness.

732
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:00,762
Why don't we try having this conversation again.

733
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,402
Where is tony almeida?

734
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:03,422
No.

735
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:06,010
I'm not talking to you.

736
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:10,491
Where is he?

737
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:13,243
Tony almeida's dead.

738
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:15,911
What do you want me to do?

739
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:20,490
This is your call.

740
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,910
Do whatever it takes.

741
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:26,802
This is against the law.

742
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:28,330
You can't do this.

743
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:30,011
I'm gonna enjoy this.

744
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:31,861
Enjoy what?

745
00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:36,282
All right,all right!

746
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:38,983
I'll tell you what I know!

747
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:44,381
There's no need for me to lose my good looks over this.

748
00:42:44,386 --> 00:42:45,933
okay.

749
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:48,352
Last time I saw almeida...

750
00:42:56,135 --> 00:42:57,010
are you all right?

751
00:42:57,015 --> 00:42:58,090
Yeah.

752
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:03,500
Tell your men they've got a shooter on top of the columbia building,heading south.

753
00:43:03,505 --> 00:43:05,252
Shots fired.Suspects are down.

754
00:43:05,256 --> 00:43:07,600
The shooter's on the roof of the columbia building across the street.

755
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:09,811
Seal all exits.

756
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:19,081
Get away from this,jack.

757
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:20,433
Tony?

758
00:43:20,437 --> 00:43:23,381
There's nothing you or the fbi can do about this.

759
00:43:23,385 --> 00:43:24,491
Just stay away.

760
00:43:24,495 --> 00:43:26,341
Tony,just talk to me.

761
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:27,960
What the hell's going...

762
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:29,492
tony...

763
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,381
tony!

764
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,820
What's going on at schector's office?

765
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:46,381
I don't know.They haven't checked in yet.

766
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:56,423
Gsa 117,northeast three,descend pilot's discretion,direct jfk.

767
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:59,790
Northeast three,roger,we're starting our descent now.

768
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:05,760
Gsa 117,descend and maintain 2,000,expect holding runway four-right.

769
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,873
Gsa 117,I did not receive your read-back.

770
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,661
Acknowledge.Over.

771
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:18,110
Gsa 117,acknowledge.

772
00:44:22,585 --> 00:44:26,193
Mr. Paulson,I've lost comm with gsa 117.

773
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:28,722
Try the emergency channels.

774
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,602
I did.

775
00:44:31,345 --> 00:44:33,192
Nothing.

776
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:34,212
And there's no fault on my board.

777
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:36,660
I redirected twice.

778
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:40,661
Something's interfering with our comm.

779
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:43,012
Call back fbi!

780
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:46,820
Tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control!

781
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:50,323
Gsa 117,acknowledge.

782
00:44:50,327 --> 00:44:52,933
Gsa 117,this is northeast three.

783
00:44:52,937 --> 00:44:55,041
Go ahead,air traffic control.

784
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:59,162
Advise passing 7,000,maintain 1,500.

785
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,431
Traffic ahead reporting moderate turbulence.

786
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:03,670
Should be a smoother ride for you down there.

787
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:05,501
