1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,730
You son of a bitch.

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,110
You're behind my son's death.

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,900
Madame president...
I have your husband.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,910
You will have your forces withdrawn from
around my country, sangala, immediately
and permanently.

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,860
Or your husband will die
a slow and certain death.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,890
I just wanted to make sure that you
were still coming to dinner tonight.

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,760
Marika, I can'T.
I'll make it up to you.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,140
If you're looking for marika,
she's not with me.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,850
I'm looking for you, samuel.

10
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:40,960
Or whatever your real name is.

11
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:43,392
Now, I don't know who you really are,
and I don't care.

12
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,781
I just want you out
of my sister's life.

13
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,544
Keep an incident quiet until what
jack and i are doing goes down.

14
00:00:58,689 --> 00:00:59,883
What incident?

15
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,813
Vossler's dead.

16
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:04,712
Jack killed him at the hotel on 18th
and reagan. It was self-defense.

17
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:07,322
Damn it, renee,
what the hell are you doing with this guy?

18
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:09,793
You're supposed to bring suspects in,
not murder them.

19
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:13,693
Until we know who dubaku's source is there,
you've got to handle this outside of
the bureau.

20
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:15,943
Dubaku is the only person
with the names of the people

21
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:18,883
who betrayed you within your government
it's imperative that we find him.

22
00:01:18,998 --> 00:01:24,140
You resigned from government service and the
senate regards you as having been a
renegade agent.

23
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,891
How am I supposed to know where
your loyalties really lie?

24
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,262
With all due respect,
madame president, ask around.

25
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,923
I got an address for henry taylor.

26
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,642
Get an ambulance!

27
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:51,952
*********

28
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:04,053
no one else gets through here.
Follow me.

29
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:09,731
It's henry taylor, the president's husband,
but that information is not to be
disseminated. Clear?

30
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:19,492
I...

31
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:22,733
mr. Taylor, don't speak.
I need you to save your energy.

32
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,591
over here!

33
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,683
Excuse me. Step back, please.

34
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,442
This is unit six.
We have a gunshot trauma to the chest...

35
00:02:33,558 --> 00:02:34,451
nine-millimeter round.

36
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:36,463
Nine
- millimeter substernal. Pulse is rapid.

37
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:37,713
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,522
I'm gonna call the president.I
want you to search all the rooms,

39
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:44,151
see if you can get anything off their
hardware that's going to tell us where
dubaku went.

40
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:50,810
******

41
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:53,330
This is jack bauer.
I need to speak with the president.

42
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,551
Hold one moment, please.

43
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:58,491
Madame president,
I would encourage you not to lose hope.

44
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:00,931
Dubaku knows we tried
to deceive him, ethan.

45
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,611
He has no reason to
keep henry alive.

46
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,762
jack bauer is on line one,
madame president.

47
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:07,632
Put him through.

48
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,491
Mr. Bauer, this is president taylor.

49
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:11,992
Madame president,
we have your husband.

50
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,253
He is alive, but he sustained
a gunshot wound to the chest.

51
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:17,260
How bad is it?

52
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:18,580
Emts are stabilizing him.

53
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:21,780
They're getting ready to transfer
him to west arlington hospital.

54
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:25,242
Mr. Bauer, be more specific.
Is my husband going to be okay?

55
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:27,943
We're not gonna know anything
until the doctors see him.

56
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:30,291
Ma'am, I have to warn you,
he has lost a lot of blood.

57
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,992
Jack, it's bill. Do you have dubaku?

58
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:34,063
Negative-- he was gone
before we got here.

59
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:37,403
Madame president, since your husband was
the only leverage that dubaku had left,

60
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:40,070
it's safe to say that he is
trying to leave the country now.

61
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:42,222
Have you any idea how
he intends to do that?

62
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:43,041
Not at this time.

63
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,482
Unfortunately, all his men were
killed during the assault.

64
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:48,420
Agent walker and i will stay behind.
We'll continue to search the area.

65
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,211
We have to assume that dubaku has
an exit strategy already in place.

66
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:54,561
Whatever we're going to do to find him,
we're going to have to do it fast.

67
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:57,711
Yes. Thank you, mr. Bauer.

68
00:03:57,825 --> 00:04:00,400
Please keep me apprised
on everything.

69
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:03,383
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

70
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:09,930
I am so sorry, madame president.

71
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,723
Ethan, I'm going to the
hospital to be with my husband.

72
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,480
Ma'am, that's not possible.

73
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,710
You're executing a
military invasion.

74
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:22,900
My generals can execute it
perfectly well without me.

75
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:25,661
We can't ignore the fact the secret
service has been compromised.

76
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:28,843
There's no way we can ensure your
safety outside the white house.

77
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,823
I don't give a damn.

78
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:34,640
I am not going to be held prisoner in this
office while my husband is fighting for
his life.

79
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:38,283
Now, either find someone to take to the
hospital or I'll drive there myself.

80
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:41,760
Madame president,
you know my record of service.

81
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:45,380
If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing to
assume responsibility for your security.

82
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:48,131
Bill, you're no longer credentialed.
You don't have the authority.

83
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:53,292
Until we capture dubaku and interrogate him,
we have no idea who in the government is
working for him.

84
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,460
You do not know who you can trust.

85
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,313
But I can trust you.

86
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:00,703
I brought this conspiracy to your attention,
madame president.

87
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:03,593
I would hope that I've earned it.

88
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:05,442
What do you need from me?

89
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:10,081
Reinstate my government clearance, allow
me the authority to vet white house staff,

90
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:15,220
and allow me to bring one of my people into
fbi to provide larry moss with
tactical support.

91
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:16,883
Who is it that you want to bring in?

92
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,711
Chloe o'brian.
I can vouch for her; she's the best there is.

93
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:23,440
Her clearances were also revoked
when ctu was decommissioned.

94
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:28,032
Isn't there anyone capable of handling these
duties without our having to reinstate her?

95
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:30,500
Someone in the bureau
is on dubaku's payroll.

96
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:34,211
Until we find out who it is, larry moss can't
take the chance of bringing his own people

97
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:36,402
into a manhunt for dubaku.

98
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,641
All right.

99
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:42,423
The director of white house secret
service operations is agent hovis.

100
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,703
I'll order him to turn over
security protocols to you.

101
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:48,333
I know ted hovis, madame president. He's
not gonna like this; he's gonna fight us.

102
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:52,011
Well, considering that agents under h charge
are responsible for what happened to
my husband,

103
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:53,961
I don't give a damn what he likes.

104
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:57,590
You have your provisional appointment, mr.
Buchanan, under the authority of this office.

105
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,132
Thank you, madame president.

106
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,202
You can thank me by
getting me to the hospital.

107
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,930
I'll make the arrangements.

108
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,221
Madame president...

109
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:07,221
your concerns are clear to me,
ethan, but I've made my decision.

110
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:10,990
I'm only trying to do my job--
looking out for your interests.

111
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,863
My interest right now
is catching ike dubaku.

112
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,552
He has killed scores of americans today,
he tried to kill my husband,

113
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:20,482
and he has corrupted our government.

114
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:24,081
Whatever it takes,
I want that son of a bitch found.

115
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:31,760
Marika... marika.

116
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,400
Samuel, what are you doing here?

117
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,280
We need to talk.

118
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:39,690
Uh, okay, well,
I get a break in 20 minutes.

119
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:43,842
No, now.

120
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,051
Okay, what is it? You're scaring me.

121
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,282
Something has come up.
I need to leave the country.

122
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:51,082
What? When?

123
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,991
Right away.

124
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:54,991
I don't understand.
W-when are you coming back?

125
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,390
Marika, listen to me.

126
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:58,290
I haven't been entirely
honest with you.

127
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:02,203
My passport visa expired a couple months
ago and I've been in the country illegally.

128
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:05,462
I'm afraid the immigration
people have caught up with me.

129
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,831
It was my sister, wasn't it?

130
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,281
She reported you, didn't she?

131
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:10,560
That doesn't matter now.

132
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:14,363
What is important is I have to leave the
country tonight, and I want you to come
with me.

133
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:15,640
Tonight?

134
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:17,220
Marika, we've talked about this.

135
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:21,052
I promised you that one day i would take you
away from here, give you the happiness that
you deserve.

136
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,222
Samuel, I-I want that, too, but...

137
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:24,733
but not tonight, not so soon.

138
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:27,912
Marika, I don't have
time to argue with you!

139
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,470
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:34,870
I can't leave rosa.

141
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:38,323
She needs me; I'm the only one she has
to take care of her. You know that.

142
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:42,043
I know, I know.
Which is why she's going to join us.

143
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:42,880
Join us?

144
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,612
As soon as possible.

145
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:47,091
I could only arrange tickets
for both of us tonight,

146
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:50,924
but I want you to promise not to tell your
sister of our plans, at least not yet.

147
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,763
I have to; I can't just run off.

148
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:57,680
No, no, no, she might cause trouble for us,
make it impossible for us to leave.

149
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:05,070
I promise you your sister will join us within
a couple of days of our arrival. Okay?

150
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,741
- Our arrival where?
- Belize.

151
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,630
I have shown you the
photographs of my home there.

152
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:15,971
Do you love me?

153
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:18,140
You know I do.

154
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:22,071
Then trust me. Say you'll come.

155
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:28,842
I'll get my things.

156
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:36,192
I still need to finalize our arrangements.
I want you to go home and pack.

157
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,421
- Wait for my call.
- All right.

158
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:51,652
- Yes.
- It's me.

159
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,360
Have you made the preparations?

160
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:54,192
Almost.

161
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,063
It's been tricky clearing
a flight corridor

162
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,183
since faa still has most private
and commercial aircraft grounded.

163
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:01,162
I have faith you'll manage.

164
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,052
The arrangements are
for two passengers?

165
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,571
Just as you requested.

166
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:06,611
Are you sure you want
to leave now, colonel?

167
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:10,390
I can't imagine general juma will be pleased
to learn that you're abandoning your mission.

168
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:12,882
The mission is over.
I have done what I can do.

169
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:16,322
If that is not enough for juma,
then to hell with him.

170
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,231
I've got your passports
and itinerary in hand.

171
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,900
Meet me at our usual spot in half an hour.
I'll bring them.

172
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:26,660
No, we'll meet in the lobby of
the roosevelt continental hotel.

173
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,783
That's not a good idea.
It'll be crowded there at this hour.

174
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:32,461
I know. I want the meeting earlier.

175
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,783
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

176
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,611
Go.

177
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,661
- I can't get it to boot. Hard drive must be fried.
- Damn it.

178
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,940
Let's search the bodies.
Start with him.

179
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:58,931
- yeah.
- Renee, it's me.

180
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,030
Bill buchanan just briefed
me on your situation.

181
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,321
What's henry taylor's status?

182
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:05,153
They've got him in an ambulance en
route to west arlington hospital.

183
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:06,592
I don't know his current condition.

184
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,862
Buchanan told me you and
bauer were in a firefight.

185
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:13,123
Yeah, we took down six of dubaku's men,
but dubaku was gone before we got there.

186
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:14,383
You all right?

187
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:16,722
I've been in worse.

188
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:19,140
******

189
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:24,403
- I'm fine, larry.
- Really? I'm not so sure about that.

190
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:26,812
And what is that supposed to mean?

191
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,322
I'm looking at a report faxed
to me from metro police.

192
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:33,901
A mrs. Carol vossler is
claiming an unidentified woman

193
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,251
held her and her child
hostage at gunpoint.

194
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,291
She says the woman
threatened to kill her son.

195
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:40,641
Larry, we discussed this.

196
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:43,571
We needed to get vossler to tell
us where taylor was being held.

197
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:45,022
It was the only leverage we had.

198
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,950
Yeah, right, whatever's necessary.

199
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:49,940
Jack bauer's rationalization for
every unethical action he takes.

200
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:52,132
It worked, larry.
Doesn't that count for something?

201
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:56,861
Renee, jack bauer is about to be sung up by a
senate subcommittee, and you are following
his playbook.

202
00:10:56,975 --> 00:11:01,203
You already got the ag's office looking into
that thing you pulled with tanner's
respirator, and now this.

203
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,032
No one was actually hurt.

204
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:07,492
No one...?
Renee, bauer killed the woman's husband!

205
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:12,492
Renee, I swear to you,
I am scared of what is happening to you.

206
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:16,262
You put these people through
hell and it doesn't bother you.

207
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,231
I didn't say that it doesn't bother me,
larry. I said that it worked.

208
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:23,233
Of course it bothers me.

209
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,232
I can see that woman's face.

210
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:30,583
She and her child staring
at me with such...

211
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,910
she had no idea that her husband was
a killer, a traitor to his country,

212
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,750
and she looked at me
like I was the monster.

213
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:39,112
- Agent walker.
- Hold on.

214
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,471
I cross-referenced the
information on these pdas.

215
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:43,531
I came across some
banking transactions.

216
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,612
All from a series of accounts
registered to the same address.

217
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,893
- You think it's a safe house?
- It's worth a shot.

218
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,161
Larry, we may have an
address on dubaku.

219
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,881
21917 euclid street. Apartment six.

220
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:58,261
21917 euclid street, unit six.
We're moving out now.

221
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,700
Can you provide sat surveillance?

222
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:03,230
Yeah, bill buchanan's sending somebody over
to run th, but until she's up and running,

223
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,740
you're gonna have to go in blind.

224
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,740
Okay. We'll be in touch.

225
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:09,491
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

226
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,710
Let's go.

227
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:03,902
Federal investigations continue into the
terrorist acts that have gripped the
nation's capital,

228
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:06,332
as well as the people
of kidron, ohio.

229
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:11,362
Despite assurances by president taylor in her
national address that the threat has passed

230
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:16,623
Sources at the white house will not confirm
that all those responsible have been
accounted for.

231
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,281
Now, are you sure you're
not gonna need my help?

232
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:25,021
I'm just running fbi ops
temporarily until they catch dubaku.

233
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:28,422
Once they find him, hopefully he'll tell us
the names of all the people on his payroll

234
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:30,361
that are inside our government.

235
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:31,611
And then, we can go home?

236
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:33,913
Then, we can go home.

237
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,122
Well, just be careful. All right?

238
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:41,000
'Cause if buchanan's right and dubaku
has someone working inside the bureau...

239
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,391
I'll watch my back.

240
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:44,620
You just watch prescott.

241
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:53,222
Okay, sweetheart, mommy has to go to work.
You be good, okay?

242
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,400
Bye, mommy.

243
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,662
- You be good, too.
- I will.

244
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:02,463
And if you get all jammed up,
you know where to find me.

245
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:10,533
I need you to cross-reference
our deployments with homeland.

246
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,140
Make sure the requisition
numbers match up.

247
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,862
After that,
you can catch up on the hourlies.

248
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:16,911
Are you joking? That is busy work,
administrative crap you're handing me.

249
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:20,882
Janis... I don't have the time or the
inclination right now to explain my
assignments to you.

250
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:21,691
Just get it done.

251
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:24,800
Agent moss, chloe o'brian just
cleared security. She's on her way up.

252
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,452
All right, thank you.

253
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:29,572
Janis, set up a secure vpn socket.
Port it to the conference room.

254
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:30,853
Why do you need a vpn socket?

255
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:35,171
I'm bringing in a consultant from homeland to
confirm there are no lingering gaps in the
cip firewall.

256
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,922
That's fine. Take that downstairs.

257
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:42,043
Ms.O'brian, larry moss.
Welcome to the fbi.

258
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,063
- You can call me chloe.
- All right, we're right in here.

259
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:54,183
Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.

260
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:55,661
- I'm up.
- Good.

261
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,263
Agent walker and bauer are pursuing
a potential lead on dubaku.

262
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,192
They're en route to this address
in the mount pleasant district.

263
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:05,411
Agent walker's requesting
satellite support.

264
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:09,072
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

265
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:10,783
I'm feeling a little exposed here.

266
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:14,291
If someone out there is working for dubaku,
shouldn't we be doing this more covertly?

267
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:17,042
As far as anyone knows,
you're working on shoring up our firewall.

268
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:20,463
Besides, this is the only space available
where you'll have full access to our server.

269
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:23,011
Our network doesn't
support remote modules.

270
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:24,211
That's inefficient.

271
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:27,653
Whoever set your network up that way
didn't know what they were doing.

272
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,600
I set our network up that way.

273
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,791
Okay.

274
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:46,082
Something else?

275
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,900
You worked with bauer for a long time,
didn't you?

276
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,901
Seven years, on and off.

277
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,262
That's impressive.

278
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:57,230
That you survived the experience.

279
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:58,853
What are you talking about?

280
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,812
Only that a lot of people didn'T.

281
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:04,572
Curtis manning, ryan chapelle.
His own wife.

282
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:08,140
Are you saying it's jack's
fault his wife was killed?

283
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:09,951
You tell me.

284
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:13,651
Jack bauer is the most trustworthy,
honorable man I know, and he'sy iend.

285
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:18,693
Maybe you should worry less about him and
more about the mole in your office working
for dubaku.

286
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:34,903
- Is that chloe o'brian?
- What?

287
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:38,482
In the conference room. Chloe o'brian--
she was senior analyst at ctu.

288
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:41,431
I once took a seminar she gave.
What's she doing here?

289
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:46,082
Larry said homeland sent her over to check
for residual breaches from the
firewall attack.

290
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:48,431
What?

291
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,521
It just doesn't sound like
her area of expertise.

292
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:54,330
Besides, as far as I know, she's been
inactive since ctu was decommissioned.

293
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:10,511
Your passports and travel itinerary.

294
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,622
A hawker-siddley 748 is
fueling at taft airfield.

295
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:16,381
Be ready to fly within a half hour,
get you to the cayman islands.

296
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,930
You shouldn't have any trouble
getting to belize from there.

297
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:21,403
I need a car to the
airfield and a driver.

298
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:23,352
I assumed you had your
own transportation.

299
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,213
It's not for me.

300
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:28,003
I see. It's for the girl.

301
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:31,912
Well, I'm not sure I can find
someone I trust on such short notice.

302
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:34,030
Really?

303
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,061
What about your man at the bar?

304
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:37,981
Excuse me?

305
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:40,900
Or one of the two on the
balcony watching us now?

306
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:44,382
Or the two in the black town
car waiting for me to leave?

307
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,762
Do you think I am a fool,
mr. Burnett?

308
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:50,032
I know you people see
me as a liability now.

309
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:53,071
These men are here to guarantee your safety,
colonel, not to threaten it.

310
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:57,013
Guarantee my safety. How nice.

311
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,851
And said with such sincerity.

312
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,672
I want you to take this
message back with you.

313
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:10,353
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country--

314
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,812
an accident or an assassination
attempt, anything--

315
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:18,752
if the plane that you were so generous
to donate decides to explode,

316
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,900
a data file with all the names and bank
transactions of all those involved

317
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:24,083
will be sent to the
justice department.

318
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:25,571
That is completely uecessary.

319
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:28,542
The same holds true if anything
should happen to marika donoso.

320
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:30,622
I swear to you,
she knows nothing of this.

321
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,583
She is no threat to you.

322
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:36,020
Make sure your driver knows this
before he brings her to me.

323
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:38,833
Do you understand what I am saying?

324
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:43,593
I want you to tell me that you understand
what I am saying to you, so there will be
no mistakes.

325
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,290
- I understand.
- Good.

326
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:52,383
The one thing I have learned in the
company of mercenaries, mr. Burnett,

327
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:57,731
is that ultimately, they care about
nothing but their own survival. Good day.

328
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:10,212
I was right.

329
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,093
Dubaku suspected we were
gonna take him out,

330
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:14,962
and apparently, he's assembled evidence
to use as an insurance policy.

331
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:17,733
We need to make sure he gets out of
the country and safely into exile.

332
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,543
Otherwise, we're all compromised.

333
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:22,331
I'll make the calls.

334
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,491
What are you doing?

335
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:30,960
Rosa.

336
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,221
Where are you going?

337
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:36,780
Rosa, listen to me.
We're going away from here. All of us.

338
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:40,173
Well, what do you mean, all?

339
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:42,753
Samuel told me the truth.

340
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,041
He's an illegal,
just like you thought.

341
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:49,543
He has to leave the country,
and I've agreed to go with him.

342
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:51,622
You're leaving me?

343
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:55,233
No, no, only for a short time.
You're gonna come, too.

344
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:58,443
Samuel's made plans. We're gonna
live with him in his home in belize.

345
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:02,233
Marika... he's lying to you.

346
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,611
- He's not.
- I won't let you do this!

347
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:06,332
My god, rosa.

348
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:09,100
I have taken care of
you my entire life.

349
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:11,500
I've sacrificed everything for you.

350
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,953
Why can't you let me have this?

351
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:14,150
I don't trust him.

352
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:17,810
Oh, well, you never liked any man
who's ever shown an interest in me.

353
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,740
Every chance I've ever had at happiness, you
found some way of ruining it. But not
this time.

354
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:23,800
- Marika, I'm begging you, listen to me.
- No.

355
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:25,883
Marika, please. Stop.

356
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:27,130
Move!

357
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:30,742
Marika, please. Listen to me.
I'm begging you, marik...

358
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:32,003
fbi-- don't move!

359
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:34,423
Get on your knees now!
On your knees!

360
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:38,381
Both of you, put your hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers. Now!

361
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,823
Do not move.

362
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:45,150
We're clear.

363
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:47,090
- Where is dubaku?
- Who?

364
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,221
Don't play games with me!

365
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:50,713
Ike dubaku--
we traced bank accounts to this address.

366
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:52,371
Now, where is he?

367
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:54,721
We don't know who
you're talking about.

368
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,622
Let me make try and make
this easier for you.

369
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:59,501
You know this man?

370
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:02,431
No.

371
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:05,670
You're lying to me.
Why are you lying to me?

372
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,392
Let me see.

373
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,421
That's him-- we know him.

374
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:14,700
- He calls himself aboa, samuel aboa.
- Rosa, shut up!

375
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,032
She was going to meet
him to leave me.

376
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:19,400
Where were you gonna meet him?
Where were you going?

377
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:20,850
I don't know.

378
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:22,920
- How do you know him? You work for him?
- No.

379
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:25,083
- Do you work for him?
- No.

380
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:31,430
You know what he's doing
here in this country?

381
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:37,732
Do you have any idea...
what this man is?

382
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,382
He's everything to me.

383
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:12,433
- Nurse...
- Mitchell.

384
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:14,561
Nurse mitchell,
I'd like to see my husband.

385
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:16,570
Uh, ma'am,
I...I don't know if that's possible.

386
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,922
I was told that dr.
Schulman will be doing the surgery.

387
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:19,840
Where is he?

388
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,113
Excuse me, madame president.

389
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,003
I'm lee schulman,
your husband's surgeon.

390
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:27,350
If you come with me, you can see him now,
but you'll need to keep it brief.

391
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:28,703
Thank you.

392
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:32,921
You should know that mr. Taylor's looking
at a minimum of five hours in surgery.

393
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:36,722
The bullet lacerated his pulmonary artery
and lodged in his thoracic region.

394
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,622
He's also suffered
massive internal bleeding.

395
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:42,741
Can you offer any kind of prognosis?

396
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,710
I'm a blunt woman, dr. Schulman.

397
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:47,082
I appreciates bluntness.

398
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:49,151
His chances aren't good, ma'am.

399
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:51,501
But I'll do everything I can.

400
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:55,010
If you'll excuse me.
I need to scrub up now.

401
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:03,380
Henry?

402
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,222
Darling, can you hear me?

403
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,190
Ally.

404
00:23:06,337 --> 00:23:08,971
Yes, sweetheart.

405
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:10,912
I'm here.

406
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,470
I'm so sorry I didn't
listen to you about roger.

407
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:14,773
You were right.

408
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,520
It wasn't suicide.

409
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,863
I know that now.
You were always right.

410
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:21,433
He was a hero.

411
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:22,382
Yes.

412
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:26,030
He was, and so are you.

413
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:31,080
I'm sorry, madame president,
but the anesthesiologist is ready now.

414
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,953
Mr. Buchanan?

415
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,780
Yes, madame president?

416
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,990
Ere's something I need
you to do for me.

417
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:10,063
Have someone find my daughter
olivia and bring her to me.

418
00:24:10,478 --> 00:24:12,971
Have you had a chance to tell her?

419
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:18,173
My daughter and I haven't spoken
for some time, mr. Buchanan.

420
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:21,343
She'd never get on
the phone with me.

421
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:27,893
She works for a consulting
firm-- martling/norris.

422
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:31,900
Do have someone
trustworthy you can send?

423
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:33,832
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:24:33,968 --> 00:24:36,152
I believe I do.

425
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:50,010
And here he is again in the uniform of the
presidential guard at the gates of the
notorious mukatu prison.

426
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:54,160
And here, inside the soccer
stadium after the barakar massacre.

427
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,112
The event that earned him the
nickname the butcher of sangala.

428
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,723
Oh, please. No more.

429
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:06,000
what did you say his
real name was again?

430
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,690
Dubaku.

431
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,640
Ike dubaku.

432
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,403
I've seen firsthand
what he's capable of.

433
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,302
I was in africa a few months ago.

434
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:20,360
He was responsible for
murdering a friend of mine.

435
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:24,183
I know this is a shock.

436
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:26,300
and I'm sorry.

437
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:28,190
I really am.But
here's the situation.

438
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:31,821
We need your help,
and we need it now.

439
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,142
what kind of help?

440
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,943
We need to put this man in custody
before he can leave the country.

441
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:36,980
Well, she already told you.

442
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:38,493
She doesn't know where he is.

443
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:40,960
Yeah, but you said earlier that
you were going to meet him.

444
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:42,323
Where?

445
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,691
He didn't say.

446
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:48,502
Just told me to go home and
pack and wait for his call.

447
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:50,673
Give me your phone.

448
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:53,773
Why?

449
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:55,762
When he calls,
I want you to answer it.

450
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:57,452
No. No, no. I can'T. I can'T.

451
00:25:57,586 --> 00:25:59,343
Yes, you can.

452
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:02,642
listen to me.
Just...just-just listen to me.

453
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:04,642
It's-it's over.

454
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:10,600
The man you thought you knew, the man
you had feelings for-- he doesn't exist.

455
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:15,022
All you've been left with are
his lies and his betrayal.

456
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,473
is that him?

457
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:21,871
Marika, please.

458
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:24,980
All I want you to do is answer
the phone and talk to him

459
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,223
so that we can find out
where he wants to meet you.

460
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:29,560
Please. You can do this.

461
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:31,750
Please just try.

462
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,222
hello.

463
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:41,053
Marika?

464
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:42,220
Yes.

465
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,093
Are you all right?

466
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:44,420
I'm fine.

467
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:46,791
What took you so long
to answer the phone?

468
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:48,710
I was in the bedroom packing.

469
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:49,991
Where are you?

470
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:51,053
What's wrong?

471
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:52,540
You sound strange.

472
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:54,241
It'S...it was rosa.

473
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:57,090
She caught me packing,
and we argued.

474
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:58,643
Is she going to be a problem for us?

475
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:00,232
No.

476
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,120
I'm sorry, samuel.

477
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,062
I had to tell her everything.

478
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,303
It was the only way.

479
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:06,930
But, uh...but she understands now.

480
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:08,321
Are you certain?

481
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:10,383
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.

482
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:14,382
Now that she knows she and I will
be together again in a few days.

483
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,420
She should thank heaven she
has such an angel for a sister.

484
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:19,782
Are you ready to go?

485
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:20,731
Almost.

486
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:21,561
Hurry up then.

487
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:22,992
I've had a car sent for you.

488
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:24,491
It should be there very shortly.

489
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:26,841
Go downstairs and wait for it.

490
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:28,031
Where is it taking me?

491
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:30,363
Don't worry. The driver will know.

492
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:35,581
I just want the woman I love to
get downstairs as quickly possible.

493
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,290
Okay.

494
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:43,870
It's all right. It's all right.

495
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:44,820
You did great.

496
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,403
Did we get the rendezvous point?

497
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:49,082
No. He's sending a
car with a driver.

498
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:50,870
Come here.

499
00:27:58,197 --> 00:27:59,612
there's no one on the street yet.

500
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,622
We could grab the driver,
get him to tell us dubaku's location.

501
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:04,272
There's no guarantee we
can get him to talk.

502
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:06,653
And if we take too long,
dubaku's not gonna wait around.

503
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:08,690
So then what do we do?

504
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,923
We can get her to go meet with him.

505
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:15,773
What?

506
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:19,073
We could track her.
We could use her cell phone as a transponder.

507
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,803
You want to send
that girl to dubaku?

508
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:22,150
We don't have another choice.

509
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:22,382
Jack.

510
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:25,773
You want to get dubaku,
this is our shot.

511
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,553
Marika?

512
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,342
I have a favor to ask of you.

513
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,223
We can't make you do this.

514
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:43,103
But when the car arrives,
we would like you to go with the driver

515
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:44,902
so that we could follow
you back to dubaku.

516
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:46,371
Oh, what-what are you talking about?

517
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:48,401
You want her to go
to him and face him?

518
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:51,513
It's the only chance we have of finding
him before he disappears forever.

519
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,143
I'll do it.

520
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:55,861
- I'll do it.
- No!

521
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,433
I'm your older sister,
and I won't allow it.

522
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:01,340
It's not your decision
to make, rosa.

523
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:03,702
It's mine.

524
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:08,371
And it's the right thing to do.

525
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:10,942
Let me see your phone.

526
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:15,272
What are you doing?

527
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,602
Getting your sid number.

528
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:18,410
It's how we're going to track you.

529
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,000
You're not gonna be out there alone.

530
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:21,491
Agent walker and i
will be following you.

531
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,140
We'll never be more
than a mile behind.

532
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:27,100
As soon as you reach the destination--
that's when we'll move in.

533
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:28,113
Marika.

534
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:29,152
A mile!

535
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:30,231
Are you crazy?

536
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,211
Rosa, enough.

537
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,312
You heard what he said.

538
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,312
He's a murderer! He could hurt you.

539
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:37,291
He won'T.

540
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:40,161
Rosa, I should have listened to you.

541
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:42,121
Sweetheart.

542
00:29:42,268 --> 00:29:43,783
You warned me about him.

543
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:48,452
Listen, the only reason why I said
those things was because I was jealous.

544
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:51,351
And I didn't want to lose you.

545
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:54,340
Larry, it's jack.

546
00:29:54,468 --> 00:29:56,533
Renee said you had someone
running operations support?

547
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:59,382
Yeah. She's right here.
I'll put you on speaker.

548
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:01,840
jack, it's chloe.

549
00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:02,673
Chloe.

550
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:03,490
What do you need?

551
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:06,210
How long's it gonna take you to set
up a sat beacon for a mobile line?

552
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:09,062
Usually a few seconds, but with the
backward way they have the system set up,

553
00:30:09,178 --> 00:30:10,673
it's gonna take at
least a few minutes.

554
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:12,620
Okay, well,
let me give you the sid number.

555
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:16,743
1-c-4-8-6-8-9.

556
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:17,630
You got it?

557
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:18,472
Got it.

558
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:20,080
Jack, who are you tracking?

559
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,142
A woman who's involved with dubaku.

560
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:23,853
He's sending a car
to take her to him.

561
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:25,881
She's one of his operatives?

562
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,760
No. It's-it's more
complicated than that.

563
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,291
Arthur, you're not going
to find another firm

564
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:11,990
that's done more high-level consulting work
for a relatively small pharmaceutical company
like yours.

565
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:18,160
Remember, my firm helped the governor craft a
plan to swap property taxes for sales taxes
in his last budget reform.

566
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:20,151
Tell me that didn't save
dexter-carr a bundle.

567
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:21,952
Oh, it did, olivia.

568
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:26,161
But since I'm specifically looking to hire
you, I need to know what you yourself can do.

569
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,601
Whatever you need.

570
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:30,481
You know my accomplishments,
you've seen my resume.

571
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:33,023
I mean white house influence.

572
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:35,323
Considering your family.

573
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:37,170
We're not lobbyists, arthur.

574
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:39,161
It states that clearly
in the contract.

575
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,751
I just thought,
since you had the president's ear...

576
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,282
I don'T.

577
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:44,882
Is that going to be a problem?

578
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:47,152
Excuse me, ms.Taylor?

579
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:49,863
Do I know you?

580
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:52,033
My name is aaron pierce.

581
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,872
Your office told me you'd be here.

582
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:57,211
I've been dispatched at
the request the president.

583
00:31:57,357 --> 00:31:59,780
Your credentials say you've retired,
mr. Pierce.

584
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:03,022
Perhaps no one informed you I refused
secret service protection months ago.

585
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:04,191
I'm aware of that, ma'am.

586
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,543
This ia special circumstance.

587
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:09,070
Well, as you can see,
I'm a little busy right now.

588
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:10,571
This isn't a good time.

589
00:32:10,686 --> 00:32:12,403
I'm sorry, but I have to insist.

590
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:13,720
It's really...it's all right.

591
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:17,890
No. No, it's not all right.

592
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:21,940
What is it that's so important for my mother
to steal me away while I'm trying to
do business?

593
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:23,783
I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am.

594
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:25,881
That informationis confidential.

595
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:27,901
Olivia, we can pick this
up at a later time.

596
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,121
Arthur, wait...

597
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:30,940
we'll be in touch.

598
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:36,942
Ma'am, please?

599
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:41,112
I'm not going anywhere with you
until you tell me what this is about.

600
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:44,303
It's your father, ms.Taylor.

601
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,462
He's been shot.

602
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:49,283
He's in surgery at west
arlington hospital.

603
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,882
Your mother's there now.

604
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:54,530
None of this is public knowledge.

605
00:32:55,998 --> 00:32:57,673
My god, I...

606
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,242
my car is just outside.

607
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,302
Excuse me, sean.

608
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:11,670
Can I please get the digital
beta key for the server?

609
00:33:11,818 --> 00:33:13,061
Why?

610
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:14,290
Larry asked for it.

611
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,611
Something to do with
the firewall assessment.

612
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:18,522
If larry wants it,
why doesn't he come to me?

613
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:19,950
I don't know.

614
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:23,211
Maybe I ought to go ask him.

615
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,712
No.

616
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,213
Okay.

617
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:30,533
I think that larry brought in this woman,
chloe o'brian, to replace me.

618
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,803
And I just want to get a bead
on what they're working on.

619
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:33,960
That's all.

620
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:37,591
That's all?
That's enough toose us both our jobs.

621
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,403
Well, maybe I should
stop covering for you.

622
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:41,902
What are you talking about?

623
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:44,713
Erika and you,
and your little sexual indiscretions.

624
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:47,393
I've said nothing to
larry or your wife.

625
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:49,871
I'm sure you'd like me
to keep it that way.

626
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:15,783
You're a little bitch,
you know that?

627
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:17,950
You're a little bitch.

628
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:27,413
Okay, jack.
The link's up, I've got the signal.

629
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,750
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

630
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,461
We're on.

631
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:39,743
Marika...

632
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:41,762
we got to go.

633
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:55,473
You-- fbi.

634
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,672
You keep her safe, you hear me?

635
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:01,113
We will.

636
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:10,420
I'm really scared.

637
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,830
You're going to be fine.

638
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,680
Just remember,
we're right behind you.

639
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:14,971
Move up here.

640
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:19,893
Now, listen, if you get into trouble,
you can signal us by dialing one-zero...

641
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:21,752
no. No, I don't want you to do that.

642
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,600
Don't do anything that's going to
raise the suspicion of the driver.

643
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:25,550
Okay.

644
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:27,100
You ready?

645
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:27,992
I'm ready.

646
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:29,902
Yeah.

647
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:40,752
What the hell are you doing?

648
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:41,871
She was scared.

649
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,391
I wanted her to know there was another
option than waiting for us to swoop in.

650
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:49,043
If we're going to find dubaku,
there are no other options, you understand?

651
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,811
Come on,
you've run operations like this.

652
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,480
Not without full tactical support,
and at least two backup units on the scene.

653
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:54,510
She's naked out there, jack.

654
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:54,553
I don't like it.

655
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:57,111
This isn't about you.

656
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:59,551
This is about her and dubaku.

657
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:04,002
Listen, life gets ugly,
innocent people get hurt-- that's a reality.

658
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:06,981
At least she got to make a choice to
be involved, to do the right thing.

659
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:09,413
Which is a lot more than I can
say for dubaku's other victims.

660
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:12,153
We have one job here--
that's to get dubaku.

661
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:15,333
Outside of that don't get involved.

662
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:19,583
Chloe, the car's here.

663
00:36:19,697 --> 00:36:21,121
Copy that.

664
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:29,342
She's getting in the car.

665
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:30,971
Copy.

666
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:39,990
She's moving. Are you cked in?

667
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:43,371
Yeah, I've got them
heading south on 14th.

668
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:46,502
Can you upload the tracking
grid to agent walker's pda?

669
00:36:46,648 --> 00:36:48,610
No, I'll have to direct you.

670
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:49,591
Just keep us close.

671
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:51,971
Understood. Head towards 14th,
make a right.

672
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:53,712
Copy that.

673
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,313
How much further?

674
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:57,172
Continuing west on r street,
crossing hampshire avenue.

675
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,260
You're less than a mile
behind the target car.

676
00:37:59,385 --> 00:38:00,762
Copy that.

677
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:05,033
Target car is turning,
left on connecticut.

678
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:06,620
Okay, rounding dupont circle.

679
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:09,503
Agent moss, is there anything in
the northern quad of the grid

680
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:12,423
that would indicate where dubaku
can hide a plane or a helicopter?

681
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:13,782
No. Nothing definitive.

682
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,121
Could be any number of launch sites.

683
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:19,112
Whoa! Whoa! What was it?

684
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:21,121
What happened?

685
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:24,052
Jack, we've got a problem.

686
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,642
Chloe, what's wrong?

687
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:27,372
- We just lost the tracking grid.
- What?

688
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:29,410
I-I don't know.
It just suddenly glitched out.

689
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:30,271
We can't afford to lose them.

690
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:32,172
Jack, I gave this woman
my word we'd protect her.

691
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:32,522
I know.

692
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:33,860
Chloe, get it back up.

693
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:36,341
We're doing our best, here, jack.

694
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,990
Wait.

695
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,321
It's back up.

696
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:40,421
What the hell happened?

697
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:42,761
I don't know,
I'm running a diagnostic right now.

698
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:45,062
Jack, they're moving southeast
on massachusetts avenue.

699
00:38:45,185 --> 00:38:46,723
You've closed the gap
to about a half mile.

700
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:48,091
You may want to back
off a little bit.

701
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,870
Okay, copy that.

702
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:50,943
Oh, no.

703
00:38:51,055 --> 00:38:51,853
What?

704
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:53,632
Somebody was in the system.

705
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:55,082
What? What are you talking about?

706
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:57,882
I'm saying someone in this office
was mirroring my terminal.

707
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:01,213
Whoever it was knows
exactly what we were doing.

708
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,943
Can you backtrace the breach?

709
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:10,761
No.

710
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:11,821
The link was severed.

711
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:14,440
It could have come from anywhere.

712
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:19,670
Jack, you getting this?

713
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,780
It looks like we might
have a security breach.

714
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:23,690
Someone is mirroring our comm.

715
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:26,751
Jack, they're coming from all sides.

716
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:28,773
Larry, we got a situation here.

717
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:29,620
what's going on?

718
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:32,461
I got metro pds Trying to
build a roadblock around us.

719
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:33,333
What?

720
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:35,462
Why would they be doing that?

721
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:38,002
I don't know. Just get 'em off us!

722
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:50,950
larry, do something!

723
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:52,282
This is agent moss.

724
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:53,963
Connect me with metro
district command.

725
00:39:54,077 --> 00:39:55,521
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

726
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:56,653
My name is jack bauer

727
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:57,950
Get out of the car right now!

728
00:39:58,116 --> 00:39:59,682
my passenger is a federal agent.

729
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,713
Get out of the car right now!

730
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:04,343
She's a federal agent!

731
00:40:05,598 --> 00:40:08,200
Put your hands behind
your back, sir.

732
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,080
Come on, larry, do something!

733
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,470
Captain, you've got to release
these people immediately!

734
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,683
No. No, that is a mistake.

735
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:18,211
No federal warrants have
been issued for them!

736
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:19,042
Yes, they have.

737
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:20,711
A warrant was called
in for the vehicle.

738
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:24,140
"Occupants armed and dangerous,
to be apprehended with decisive force."

739
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:24,993
Issued by whom?

740
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:25,813
Fbi. This office.

741
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:28,143
There's no attribution,
but the routing code's real.

742
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:31,060
This was definitely
done by someone here.

743
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:34,052
Marika's car just turned
east onto n street.

744
00:40:34,186 --> 00:40:35,353
Captain, listen carefully.

745
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:39,972
I'm the special agent in charge of this
operation, and I am revoking these
warrants immediately.

746
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,282
No. No, I don't have time to
deal with your chain of command.

747
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:46,403
You need to release
these people right now!

748
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:51,121
Thank you.

749
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:52,781
So is o'brian here to replace you?

750
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,603
I don't know.

751
00:40:53,707 --> 00:40:54,430
No.

752
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:57,923
Larry's using her for some kind of
covert operation with jack bauer.

753
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,462
They're tracking a car to dubaku.

754
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:02,022
Why would he keep us in the
dark about something like that?

755
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:02,830
I don't know.

756
00:41:02,965 --> 00:41:05,360
I don't know, but I don't like it.

757
00:41:17,485 --> 00:41:19,122
Hey, I took care of
bauer and walker.

758
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:20,413
They're pinned down.

759
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,970
Why am I being brought in
on this so last minute?

760
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,280
Moss is running this op on his own.

761
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:29,041
It took me some time to
tap into his phone line.

762
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:30,571
He's on with metro right now.

763
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:34,091
Can you at least disable the tracking
signal they're using to follow the girl?

764
00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:35,291
No, not from my console.

765
00:41:35,437 --> 00:41:38,522
But judging by the frequency,
they're using her cell as the tracker.

766
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:39,631
All right.

767
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:41,250
Good work.

768
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:45,591
You told me that once dubaku served
his purpose, you'd take him out.

769
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:47,202
Why are we still helping him?

770
00:41:47,335 --> 00:41:52,531
He's threatening to expose us using the
database he's kept with names and accounts of
everyone involved.

771
00:41:54,197 --> 00:41:55,182
Including mine?

772
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:56,411
I mean, everyone.

773
00:41:56,535 --> 00:41:59,930
We don't know where the file is,
so you just better pray that he gets away.

774
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:14,352
Yes, it has to do with the terrorist
threats that happened this morning.

775
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:27,272
hello?

776
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:28,561
You got a problem.

777
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:29,481
What is it?

778
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,112
Your girlfriend's been
turned by the fbi.

779
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:33,473
I don't believe you.

780
00:42:33,605 --> 00:42:37,001
They met with her a half hour ago,
told her who you really are.

781
00:42:37,157 --> 00:42:37,880
That's impossible.

782
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:39,340
Marika would never do this.

783
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:42,433
I got it from our source inside the bureau,
it is definite.

784
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:45,371
She agreed to lead them to you,
using her cell phone as a tracker.

785
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:48,530
Look, my source managed to stall
their surveillance team for a while,

786
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:51,322
but you need to get to
the airfield immediately.

787
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:53,410
I'll call my driver,
have him take care of her.

788
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:54,253
No.

789
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:55,372
I'll do it.

790
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,920
Colonel, I told you,
they are tracking her.

791
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:00,833
If you let her come to you,
you're risking your chances of escape.

792
00:43:00,968 --> 00:43:03,840
I said, I'll take care of her!
